    of the expected state of a properly working system. Simply comparing the observed
    state against the expected state wil elucidate what went wrong. Unfortunately,
    the world rarely works this way. Chips are black boxes, and the only visibility
    into the internal state of the chip is through its pins. Many signals are also
    too difficult to directly measure or record. Also, the specifications provided
    by manufacturers are often vague or difficult to interpret. Thus, the real art
    of debugging is in tracing a set of symptoms to a root cause despite a lack of
    visibility and total system knowledge.

    debug is like trying to read a Japanese comic without any knowledge of Japanese.
    You can figure out at a superficial level who is the bad guy and who is the good
    guy, but you get really lost as to exactly what the floating cat has to do with
    all of it. In order to fully understand the plot, you need a Japanese dictionary
    and a lot of time and patience. Similarly, basic electronics principles and intuition
    will get you to the point where you know roughly what to expect, but enlightenment
    only comes after you have read the component data sheets. The more you understand
    about a system, the easier it wil be to figure out why things went wrong. Keep
    notes as you read more about the system, and think to yourself about ways problems
    might express themselves if something did go wrong. It also helps to have seen
    other systems that are similar to the one you are trying to fix, and it helps

    of a symptom. There are many reasons why your TV screen could be blank, such as
    a broken video cable, a broken TV, a broken video connector, a broken video source,
    blank media in the video source, or even lack of power to the system. As a general
    rule, you should observe at least two, preferably three, symptoms that are consistent
    with a cause before concluding that you have found the root cause. Keep in mind
    that the most telling symptoms are often not outwardly obvious, and will require
    a measurement or an experiment to find them. In the example of our blank TV screen,
    our measurements are as simple as seeing if the power light on the TV turns on,

    various parts of the system to determine which part is the immediate cause of
    the symptom. An immediate cause is defined as something that directly impacts
    the observed symptom. Immediate causes for video failure on a TV are lack of a
    signal to the TV, a broken TV, or lack of power; non-immediate causes would be
    a hardware failure in your video source or the phase of the moon. In other words,
    given symptom A, think of all the possible immediate causes X, Y, and Z, and then
    test each to determine which is the actual cause. Once you have isolated the problem,
    think about what might have caused it to fail and repeat the process until you
    have discovered the *root cause*.

- en: Isolating the cause of bugs can be facilitated by the use of known good references.
    In our example, you can eliminate the TV as a source of failure by feeding it
    a signal from a known good DVD player. In order for a known good reference experiment
    to be valid, you must keep everything constant except for the piece you are replacing
    with the reference. Plugging the good DVD player into a different input from the
    consoles’ on the TV will only tell us that the display part of the TV works. The
    path from the console input to the TV is not tested. A proper execution of the
    experiment would plug the DVD player into the video input used by the console.

- en: This kind of paranoia or inherent mistrust of the system becomes very important
    when tracing down subtle hardware bugs. Do not take any factor for granted that
    could affect the system you are observing, and never, ever ignore an inexplicable
    or inconsistent behavior, even if it is intermittent. For example, sometimes a
    system will work properly or break if you touch a certain location on the circuit
    board or wave your hand near a certain area; sometimes a system will demonstrate
    different behavior for a brief moment after power-on. It is tempting to write
    off such observations as anomalies or trivial occurrences, but the fact is that
    they did happen and there must be an explanation. One specific example is touching
    a circuit board and observing a change in the state of the system. Where did you
    touch? How did you touch it? Are your hands sweaty or dry? When you touch a circuit
    board, your body acts like a small capacitance and a large resistance. This can
    slightly slow down signals or discharge high-impedance nodes such as an unconnected
    digital input. If you pressed firmly on the board, you could be flexing the board
    in such a way that changes the electrical properties of a cracked trace or a bad
    solder joint.

- en: There are some symptoms that are often times incorrectly interpreted as causes.
    A burned-out trace or a damaged component is usually a symptom and not a cause
    of the problem. In other words, a malfunction elsewhere in the circuit is usually
    responsible for the failure of a component. Spontaneous component failure is a
    relatively rare occurrence. Suppose you are debugging a broken stereo. You smell
    something burning coming from the stereo, and you see a large resistor that is
    blackened from overheating. Chances are that if you just replace that resistor,
    the replacement will just burn out again. The real cause might be a shorted transistor

- en: '**Bad solder joint.** This includes cold solder joints, bridges, and forgotten
    joints. Careful visual inspection can catch many instances of bad joints. The
    solder between all joints should appear to be smooth and shiny, and the solder
    should exhibit a wet-looking meniscus over circuit board pads and component leads.
    Pictures of good and bad solder joints can be found in Appendix B: Soldering Techniques.
    Poor solder joints can also be quickly identified on many surface mount packages
    by gently dragging a stiff wire, such as the tip of a tweezer or a paperclip,
    over the pins along the length of the package. Poorly connected pins will bend
    slightly. Flexing the board can also help reveal poor solder joints. In other
    cases, you may have to use an ohmmeter to verify the quality of a solder joint.
    (If you had a messy experience soldering your components, clean the board with
    a mild solvent such as Isopropyl Alcohol using a cotton swab before inspection.)
    Finally, remember that seeing is believing: use a magnifying lens to help your
    inspections. A medium-power microscope is preferred, but any mounted magnifying
    lens (like those found on drafter’s lamps) or a ring loupe like the kind used
    by jewelers will help enormously.'

  zh: '**最佳方案是预防。不要使用功率过大的烙铁在电路板上工作。建议使用温度控制的烙铁，但一个低功率（15 瓦）的烙铁也可以使用。此外，如果焊料似乎没有粘到板上，停止加热。相反，在板上和线上涂一点助焊剂，并用烙铁尖端养护剂或用蒸馏水湿润的海绵清洁烙铁尖端（自来水含有可能损坏烙铁尖端的化学物质）。这将提高可焊性，因此你不需要施加太多热量或力量来形成连接。**'
- en: The first thing to do when you see a trace or pad lifting off of the circuit
    board is to STOP! Do not aggravate the problem further; the worst thing you can
    do is cause the entire trace to peel back by continuing to pull on the wire. Remove
    the wire, if it is still connected, by barely touching the soldering iron to the
    joint and letting the wire fall off. Figure E-1 illustrates such a disaster scene.

  zh: 当你看到电路板上的走线或焊盘抬起时，首先要做的是停止！不要使问题进一步恶化；你能做的最糟糕的事情就是继续拉线，导致整个走线剥落。如果线仍然连接，通过轻轻触摸烙铁到接头并让线脱落来移除线。图
    E-1 展示了这样的灾难场景。

  zh: 从断裂的走线中恢复的策略是移除阻焊膜，用跳线修复走线，并沿着走线找到附近的元件或通孔作为焊接的替代点。
- en: Removing the soldermask reveals the underlying copper traces. A short jumper
    wire can be soldered to these bared traces to fix the discontinuity caused by
    the torn trace. The bare region also serves as a convenient starting point for
    using a continuity meter to find an alternate point for affixing the jumper wire.
    Remove the soldermask using either a fine-grit (200 or finer) sandpaper, or by
    scraping the surface with a sharp hobbyists knife. When removing the soldermask,
    be careful not to catch pieces of the broken trace and further tear the trace
    of the board. Once the soldermask has been removed, clean the region with a gentle
    solvent, such as rubbing alcohol, using a cotton swab. Then, apply a very thin
    layer of soldering flux to the region and rub a clean soldering iron tip along
    the exposed traces. Small amounts of solder sticking to the iron’s tip will wick
    onto the circuitboard and coat the traces, preventing oxidation of the bare copper.
    If the iron’s tip is too clean, apply a drop of solder to it and lightly wipe
    the tip off on a wet sponge and try again. Do not attempt to tin the exposed traces
    with a ball of molten solder on the tip. Excess solder will be deposited that
    can lead to shorts. (Note that the soldering flux is essential for getting a uniform,
    thin coating of solder on the traces. Do not skip the application of the solder
    flux.) Figure E-2 illustrates what the traces will look like before and after
    the tinning process.

  zh: 移除焊膏后，会露出底层的铜迹。可以将一小段跳线焊接到这些裸露的迹线上，以修复由于断裂的迹线造成的断路。裸露区域也便于使用通断测试仪找到一个跳线的替代连接点。可以使用细砂纸（200目或更细）或用锋利的爱好者刀片刮除焊膏。在移除焊膏时，要小心不要抓到断裂的迹线碎片，以免进一步撕裂电路板的迹线。焊膏移除后，用温和的溶剂，如酒精棉签清洁该区域。然后，在该区域涂上一层非常薄的焊膏，并用干净的烙铁头沿着暴露的迹线擦拭。少量的焊膏会从烙铁头吸到电路板上，并覆盖迹线，防止裸露铜氧化。如果烙铁头太干净，可以在上面滴一滴焊膏，轻轻地在湿海绵上擦拭烙铁头，然后再次尝试。不要尝试在烙铁头尖端用熔化的焊膏球来镀锡迹线。过多的焊膏会导致短路。（注意，焊膏对于在迹线上获得均匀、薄层的焊膏至关重要。不要省略焊膏的应用。）图E-2展示了镀锡前后迹线的样子。

    point for attaching your modification wire. Most voltmeters come with an audible
    continuity meter function. When selected, a tone is emitted from the voltmeter
    whenever the resistance between the probes is very low.

  zh: 在这个阶段，你可能想使用一个通断测试仪来确定一个用于连接你的修改线的替代点。大多数万用表都带有可听见的通断测试仪功能。当选择此功能时，当探针之间的电阻非常低时，万用表会发出声音。
- en: Vias and component leads both make good alternate attachment points. If you
    decide to use a via, you must scrape the solder mask off and condition the via
    prior to attaching the modification wire. Figure E-3 illustrates using a continuity
    meter to find an alternate soldering point. Keep in mind that sometimes you will
    have to trace through several vias to find the best alternate attachment point.

- en: The next step is to attach a short jumper wire across the broken trace. Apply
    a touch more soldering flux over the region of the broken trace. Cut a piece of
    fine wire (about 30-gauge) that is about the length of the gap in question. Place
    the wire over the gap, using the stickiness of the soldering flux to aid the placement
    process. Hold the wire in place with a pair of tweezers, and apply heat with the
    soldering iron until both sides have bonded to the edges of the broken trace.
    Verify that the wire is in place by gently pushing on it with the tweezers; the
    wire should not move. Also inspect for shorts to neighboring traces using your
    continuity meter. If a short is discovered, simply heat the jumper until it falls
    off the board and try again. Figure E-4 illustrates what the repaired trace looks
    like.

  zh: 下一步是将一段短跳线连接到断裂的线路。在断裂线路的区域施加更多焊剂。剪一段细线（约30号线径），长度大约与问题中的间隙相同。将线放在间隙上，利用焊剂的粘性帮助放置过程。用镊子固定线，并用烙铁加热，直到两侧都粘附到断裂线路的边缘。用镊子轻轻推动线，以确认线是否到位；线不应移动。同时，使用万用表检查相邻线路的短路。如果发现短路，只需加热跳线，直到它从板上脱落，然后再次尝试。图
