    languages? Are you able to read through a chapter in a programming book, nodding
    your head the whole way, but unable to apply what you’ve read to your own programs?
    Are you able to comprehend a program example you’ve read online, even to the point
    where you could explain to someone else what each line of the code is doing, yet
    you feel your brain seize up when faced with a programming task and a blank screen
    in your text editor?

- en: You’re not alone. I have taught programming for over 15 years, and most of my
    students would have fit this description at some point in their instruction. We
    will call the missing skill *problem solving*, the ability to take a given problem
    description and write an original program to solve it. Not all programming requires
    extensive problem solving. If you’re just making minor modifications to an existing
    program, debugging, or adding testing code, the programming may be so mechanical
    in nature that your creativity is never tested. But all programs require problem
    solving at some point, and all good programmers can solve problems.

  zh: 你并不孤单。我教授编程已经超过15年了，我的大多数学生在他们的学习过程中某个时刻都会符合这种描述。我们将缺失的技能称为*问题解决能力*，即能够接受一个给定的问题描述并编写一个原创程序来解决它。并非所有编程都需要广泛的问题解决。如果你只是在修改现有的程序，调试，或者添加测试代码，编程可能非常机械，以至于你的创造力从未得到考验。但所有程序在某个时候都需要问题解决，而且所有优秀的程序员都能解决问题。
- en: Problem solving is hard. It’s true that a few people make it look easy—the “naturals,”
    the programming world’s equivalent of a gifted athlete, like Michael Jordan. For
    these select few, high-level ideas are effortlessly translated into source code.
    To make a Java metaphor, it’s as if their brains execute Java natively, while
    the rest of us have to run a virtual machine, interpreting as we go.

  zh: 问题解决是困难的。确实，有些人让它看起来很容易——他们是“天生的”，编程界的天才运动员，就像迈克尔·乔丹。对于这少数人来说，高级思想可以毫不费力地转化为源代码。用Java的比喻来说，就好像他们的大脑能够原生地执行Java，而其他人则不得不运行一个虚拟机，边走边解释。
- en: Not being a natural isn’t fatal to becoming a programmer—if it were, the world
    would have few programmers. Yet I’ve seen too many worthy learners struggle too
    long in frustration. In the worst cases, they give up programming entirely, convinced
    that they can never be programmers, that the only good programmers are those born
    with an innate gift.

  zh: 为什么学习解决编程问题如此困难？
- en: In part, it’s because problem solving is a different activity from learning
    programming syntax and therefore uses a different set of mental “muscles.” Learning
    programming syntax, reading programs, memorizing elements of an application programming
    interface—these are mostly analytical “left brain” activities. Writing an original
    program using previously learned tools and skills is a creative “right brain”
    activity.

  zh: 在一定程度上，这是因为问题解决是一种与学习编程语法不同的活动，因此使用的是不同的一套心理“肌肉”。学习编程语法，阅读程序，记忆应用程序编程接口的元素——这些大多是分析性的“左脑”活动。使用之前学到的工具和技能编写一个原创程序是一种创造性的“右脑”活动。
- en: Suppose you need to remove a branch that has fallen into one of the rain gutters
    on your house, but your ladder isn’t quite long enough for you to reach the branch.
    You head into your garage and look for something, or a combination of things,
    that will enable you to remove the branch from the gutter. Is there some way to
    extend the ladder? Is there something you can hold at the top of the ladder to
    grab or dislodge the branch? Maybe you could just get on the roof from another
    place and get the branch from above. That’s problem solving, and it’s a creative
    activity. Believe it or not, when you design an original program, your mental
    process is quite similar to that of the person figuring out how to remove the
    branch from the gutter and quite different from that of a person debugging an
    existing `for` loop.

- en: Most programming books, though, focus their attention on syntax and semantics.
    Learning the syntax and semantics of a programming language is essential, but
    it’s only the first step in learning how to program in that language. In essence,
    most programming books for beginners teach how to read a program, not how to write
    one. Books that do focus on writing are often effectively “cookbooks” in that
    they teach specific “recipes” for use in particular situations. Such books can
    be quite valuable as time savers, but not as a path toward learning to write original
    code. Think about cookbooks in the original sense. Although great cooks own cookbooks,
    no one who relies upon cookbooks can be a great cook. A great cook understands
    ingredients, preparation methods, and cooking methods and knows how they can be
    combined to make great meals. All a great cook needs to produce a tasty meal is
    a fully stocked kitchen. In the same way, a great programmer understands language
    syntax, application frameworks, algorithms, and software engineering principles
    and knows how they can be combined to make great programs. Give a great programmer
    a list of specifications, turn him loose with a fully stocked programming environment,
    and great things will happen.

  zh: 然而，大多数编程书籍都将注意力集中在语法和语义上。学习编程语言的语法和语义是必要的，但它是学习如何用该语言编程的第一步。本质上，大多数针对初学者的编程书籍教授的是如何阅读程序，而不是如何编写程序。那些专注于编写的书籍通常实际上就像“食谱集”，它们教授特定情况下使用的特定“食谱”。这样的书籍可以作为节省时间的工具非常有价值，但不是学习编写原创代码的途径。想想原始意义上的食谱集。虽然伟大的厨师拥有食谱集，但依赖食谱集的人不可能成为伟大的厨师。一个伟大的厨师了解原料、准备方法和烹饪方法，并知道如何将它们结合起来制作出美味的菜肴。一个伟大的厨师只需要一个库存充足的厨房就能制作出美味的饭菜。同样，一个伟大的程序员了解语言语法、应用程序框架、算法和软件工程原则，并知道如何将它们结合起来制作出优秀的程序。给一个伟大的程序员一份规格列表，让他在一个库存充足的编程环境中自由发挥，就会产生伟大的成果。
- en: In general, current programming education doesn’t offer much guidance in the
    area of problem solving. Instead, it’s assumed that if programmers are given access
    to all of the tools of programming and requested to write enough programs, eventually
    they will learn to write such programs and write them well. There is truth in
    this, but “eventually” can be a long time. The journey from initiation to enlightenment
    can be filled with frustration, and too many who start the journey never reach
    the destination.

  zh: 通常，当前的编程教育在问题解决领域并没有提供很多指导。相反，人们认为，如果程序员能够接触到所有编程工具并被要求编写足够多的程序，他们最终会学会编写这样的程序，并且编写得很好。这一点是正确的，但“最终”可能是一个很长的时间。从启蒙到领悟的旅程可能会充满挫折，太多开始这段旅程的人从未到达目的地。
- en: 'Instead of learning by trial and error, you can learn problem solving in a
    systematic way. That’s what this book is all about. You can learn techniques to
    organize your thoughts, procedures to discover solutions, and strategies to apply
    to certain classes of problems. By studying these approaches, you can unlock your
    creativity. Make no mistake: Programming, and especially problem solving, is a
    creative activity. Creativity is mysterious, and no one can say exactly how the
    creative mind functions. Yet, if we can learn music composition, take advice on
    creative writing, or be shown how to paint, then we can learn to creatively solve
    programming problems, too. This book isn’t going to tell you precisely what to
    do; it’s going to help you develop your latent problem-solving abilities so that

- en: C++ was selected for a number of reasons. First, it’s popular in a variety of
    problem areas. Second, because of its origins in the strictly procedural C language,
    C++ code can be written using both the procedural and object-oriented paradigms.
    Object-oriented programming is so common now that it could not be omitted from
    a discussion on problem solving, but many fundamental problem-solving concepts
    can be discussed in strictly procedural programming terms, and doing so simplifies
    both the code and the discussion. Third, as a low-level language with high-level
    libraries, C++ allows us to discuss both levels of programming. The best programmers
    can “hand-wire” solutions when required and make use of high-level libraries and
    application programming interfaces to reduce development time. Lastly, and partly
    as a function of the other reasons listed, C++ is a great choice because once
    you have learned to solve problems in C++, you have learned to solve problems
    in any programming language. Many programmers have discovered how the skills learned
    in one language easily apply to other languages, but this is especially true for
    C++ because of its cross-paradigm approach and, frankly, because of its difficulty.
    C++ is the real deal—it’s programming without training wheels. This is daunting
    at first, but once you start succeeding in C++, you’ll know that you’re not going
    to be someone who can do a little coding—you’re going to be a programmer.

  zh: C++ 被选用的原因有很多。首先，它在各种问题领域中都很受欢迎。其次，由于它起源于严格的过程式编程语言 C，C++ 代码可以使用过程式和面向对象两种范式编写。面向对象编程现在如此普遍，以至于在讨论问题解决时不能省略它，但许多基本的问题解决概念可以在严格的过程式编程术语中进行讨论，这样做既简化了代码也简化了讨论。第三，作为一种底层语言但拥有高级库的语言，C++
    允许我们讨论编程的这两个层面。最好的程序员在需要时可以“手工接线”解决方案，并利用高级库和应用编程接口来减少开发时间。最后，部分原因是由于前面列出的其他原因，C++
    是一个很好的选择，因为一旦你学会了在 C++ 中解决问题，你就学会了在任何编程语言中解决问题。许多程序员已经发现，在一种语言中学到的技能很容易应用到其他语言中，但这一点对于
    C++ 来说尤其如此，因为它采用了跨范式的方法，而且坦白说，因为它难度较大。C++ 是真正的编程——没有辅助轮的编程。一开始这可能会让人感到害怕，但一旦你开始在
    C++ 中取得成功，你就会知道你不会只是一个能做一点编码的人——你将是一名程序员。
