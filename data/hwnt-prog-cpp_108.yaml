- en: When NASA attempted to launch the first space shuttle, they rolled the spacecraft
    out to the pad, put the astronauts on board, and started the countdown. Then the
    computer reported a self-check failure. They tried and tried and tried to figure
    out what was wrong. In the end, they had to cancel the launch.

  zh: 当NASA试图发射第一艘太空飞船时，他们把航天器推出到发射台，宇航员登上飞船，并开始倒计时。然后计算机报告了自检失败。他们尝试了又尝试，试图找出问题所在。最后，他们不得不取消发射。
- en: The problem was eventually traced to a race condition that had a 1 out of 64
    chance of occurring each time the system was started.

- en: Programmers who have to deal with multiple processes and embedded systems have
    their own set of problems to worry about. These are usually much more difficult
    to find than ordinary errors because errors happen randomly, and bugs can resist
    discovery by testing. Furthermore, code that looks perfectly good and reasonable
    can contain hidden errors.
