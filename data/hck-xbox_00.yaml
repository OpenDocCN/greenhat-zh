    and not just because it can play the latest video games. The powerful and cheap
    Xbox has the potential to be used as a PC, an all-in-one media player, or even
    a web server. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of books that can teach a reader
    how to explore and modify modern electronic hardware such as the Xbox. Most electronics
    textbooks are theory-oriented and very focused, whereas real hacking requires
    a broad set of practical skills and knowledge. Also, the few practical books on
    hardware hacking that I had as inspiration as a child have long been outdated
    by the fast pace of technology. This book is intended to fill the need for a practical
    guide to understanding and reverse engineering modern computers: a handbook for
    a new generation of hackers.'

  zh: 微软®的XboxTM游戏机是一款令人兴奋的硬件设备，不仅仅因为它可以玩最新的视频游戏。功能强大且价格低廉的Xbox有潜力被用作PC、一体式媒体播放器，甚至网络服务器。不幸的是，关于如何探索和修改现代电子硬件（如Xbox）的书籍寥寥无几。大多数电子教科书都是理论导向且非常专注于理论，而真正的黑客活动需要广泛实用的技能和知识。此外，我小时候作为灵感的那些关于硬件黑客的实用书籍，由于技术发展迅速，早已过时。本书旨在填补理解和逆向工程现代计算机的实用指南的需求：一本面向新一代黑客的手册。
- en: 'The ultimate benefit of hacking the Xbox is its educational value, or as the
    saying goes, “Given a fish, eat for a day; learn to fish, eat for a lifetime.”
    Hence, this book focuses on introducing basic hacking techniques — soldering,
    reverse engineering, debugging — to novice hackers, whileproviding hardware references
    and insight that may be useful to more seasoned hackers. The Xbox has served to
    educate both the security community and the hacking community: not because it
    is an outstanding example of security, but because it is a high profile, high
    volume product made by a large company whose focus was recently defined to be
    security by its chairman.¹ The Xbox experience shows that building trustable clients
    in a hostile user environment is hard, even for a large, well-funded company.
    One observation is that this risk and difficulty of building cheap, trustable
    hardware clients places an upper bound on the importance of the secret that can
    be trusted to such client hardware. In addition, the Xbox provides a consistent
    teaching example, with almost 10 mil ion nearly identical units out there at the
    time of writing. The similarity of the Xbox’s architecture to a vanilla PC adds
    even more educational value to Xbox hacking, since much of the discussion in this
    book also applies directly to the much broader subject of PCs.'

  zh: 黑客Xbox的最终好处是其教育价值，正如俗话所说，“给鱼吃一天；学会钓鱼，吃一辈子。”因此，本书专注于介绍基本的黑客技巧——焊接、逆向工程、调试——给新手黑客，同时提供对硬件的参考和洞察，这些可能对经验更丰富的黑客有所帮助。Xbox已经为安全社区和黑客社区提供了教育价值：不是因为它是安全性的杰出例子，而是因为它是由一家大公司制造的高知名度、高销量产品，其董事长最近将其重点定义为安全性。¹
    Xbox的经验表明，在敌对用户环境中建立可信赖的客户端是困难的，即使是对于一家大型的、资金充足的公司也是如此。一个观察结果是，构建廉价、可信赖的硬件客户端的风险和难度为可以信赖此类客户端硬件的秘密的重要性设定了上限。此外，Xbox提供了一个一致的教学示例，在撰写本书时，有近1000万几乎完全相同的单位。Xbox的架构与普通PC的相似性为Xbox黑客活动增添了更多的教育价值，因为本书中的许多讨论也直接适用于更广泛的PC主题。
- en: Another interesting aspect of Xbox hacking is the underground society of hardware
    hackers following the Xbox. The people who hacked the Xbox and the expertise they
    attained will be relevant long after the Xbox has become a dusty yard sale piece.
    Hence, there is a conscious social focus to this book. I have included profiles
    of a sampling of Xbox hacking personalities. The hope is to inspire people, through
    role models, to pick up a screwdriver and a soldering iron and to start hacking.
    Instilling this sort of exploratory spirit in the younger generations will be
    important in the long run for preserving the pool of talented engineers that drove
    the technology revolution to where it is today. Many of today’s engineers got
    their start hacking and tinkering with ham radios, telephones and computers which,
    back in that day, shipped with a complete set of schematics and source code. This
    pool of engineering talent is essential for maintaining a healthy economy and
    for maintaining strong national security in the computer age.

    an expectation for high performance game hardware forces console vendors to sell
    their hardware at a loss. As a result, a “closed-console” business strategy is
    used by console vendors: the console is sold as a loss leader, and profits come
    from future sales of video game titles. This business strategy requires a large
    amount of up-front investment in console hardware and in advertising. It is the

    Thus, the risk of building and deploying millions of units of hardware, and the

    almost entirely by the console manufacturer. As a result, there are currently
    only three players in the game console business today: Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

    Nintendo has cornered the handheld market with its Gameboy line of products. Microsoft
    is the new player in the game console market. The race for second place is yet

- en: Crucial to the success of the closed-console business model is the idea of locking
    consumers into buying only approved, royalty-bearing game titles. In other words,
    piracy and unapproved game titles can destroy the profitability of the business.
    Hence, a console must employ security mechanisms that hamper game copying and
    unapproved game development and distribution. The failure of the Sega Dreamcast
    is a salient example of what happens when security mechanisms fail.

    the NEC PowerVR2 DC chip, the graphics accelerator used by the Dreamcast, limited
    initial shipments. The following three years were a rollercoaster ride for the
    Dreamcast. Popular games such as Soul Caliber, Dead or Alive 2, Resident Evil,
    Crazy Taxi and Shen Mue buoyed the Dreamcast’s popularity, while Sony’s Playstation2
    launch ate away at the Dreamcast’s sales and ultimately the confidence of software
    developers. Ironically, the quality of the Dreamcast graphics was equivalent or
    superior to quality to early Playstation2 titles, such as Dead or Alive 2, despite
    the extra horsepower packed by the Playstation2\. (The Playstation2 is difficult
    to program, and it took a couple of years for developers to realize its full potential.)

    Shen Mue》这样的热门游戏提升了Dreamcast的受欢迎程度，而索尼PlayStation2的上市则蚕食了Dreamcast的销量，最终损害了软件开发者的信心。讽刺的是，尽管PlayStation2拥有额外的动力，但Dreamcast的图形质量与早期PlayStation2的标题，如《生死格斗2》相当或更优。（PlayStation2编程困难，开发者花了几年时间才充分发挥其潜力。）
- en: The final nail in the Dreamcast’s coffin was hammered in the spring and summer
    of 2000\. A German hacker group, Team Utopia, discovered a back door inside the
    Dreamcast’s mask-ROM BIOS that allowed the Dreamcast to boot from a standard CD-ROM.
    Nominally, the Dreamcast uses a proprietary format called the “GD-ROM” for game
    distribution. The GD-ROM format cannot be copied using standard CD or DVD burners.
    However, the back door in the Dreamcast’s ROM BIOS enabled pirates to eventually
    create monolithic CD-ROM images of video games that were bootable without any
    need for hardware modification. Who was going to pay for a game when it could
    be downloaded for free on the internet? The resulting rampant piracy diminished
    game sales, discouraging game developers from developing for the console and damaging
    Sega’s business. Six million units sold, and about three years after its launch,
    the Dreamcast was pulled from the market. Now, Sega is exclusively in the game
    development business, and even makes games for their former competitors Sony and
    Nintendo as well as Microsoft.

    BIOS中的后门使得盗版者最终能够创建无需任何硬件修改即可启动的视频游戏的单一代码CD-ROM镜像。当游戏可以在互联网上免费下载时，谁会为游戏付费呢？由此产生的猖獗盗版减少了游戏销量，阻碍了游戏开发者为该游戏机开发，并损害了世嘉的业务。售出600万台，大约在发布后三年，梦幻代号被从市场上撤下。现在，世嘉专注于游戏开发业务，甚至为他们的前竞争对手索尼、任天堂以及微软开发游戏。

    brutal problem for the Microsoft Xbox, since it is built from standard PC hardware
    originally designed to be open and to run code loaded from numerous sources. Hence,
    Microsoft’s fate in the console market is intimately linked to the success and
    robustness of theXbox security system. The security system has held up fairly
    well so far: all of the weaknesses found require at least a solderless, warranty-voiding

    who explored the roofs and tunnels of buildings of university campuses. Quite
    often, early hackers engaged in all of these activities. Hackers would share their

    cannot share those results with the world.

    get my PhD thesis at MIT for hacking the Xbox. Hacking the Xbox was actually a
    diversion from my thesis that was tangentially related, but not central to my

- en: My thesis on supercomputers ⁸ focused on an architecture for efficient code
    and data migration. My interest in video game consoles stems from my natural curiosity
    about all hardware combined with the encouragement of my thesis adviser, Dr. Tom
    Knight. Video game consoles represent the pinnacle of performance per cost, and
    cost is a significant issue for supercomputers today. Hence, I was encouraged
    to look at all video game consoles to see what I could learn about building cost
    effective hardware. The fact that the Xbox also had an interesting security system
    was a bonus; since government agencies have a great interest in supercomputer
    technology, the security of supercomputers is always a topic for consideration.
    (In fact, a very interesting paper about building trustable computers⁹ was written
    by colleagues in my research group; I recommend reading it if you are curious
    about alternatives to cryptographically secured trusted computing platforms, such
    as Palladium and TCPA.)

  zh: 我关于超级计算机的论文⁸专注于高效代码和数据迁移的架构。我对游戏机的兴趣源于我对所有硬件的自然好奇心，以及我的论文导师，汤姆·奈特博士的鼓励。游戏机代表了性能与成本的巅峰，而成本对于今天的超级计算机来说是一个重要问题。因此，我被鼓励去查看所有游戏机，看看我能从构建成本效益硬件中学到什么。Xbox还拥有一个有趣的安全系统，这算是一个额外的收获；由于政府机构对超级计算机技术非常感兴趣，超级计算机的安全性始终是一个需要考虑的话题。（事实上，我的研究小组的同事们写了一篇关于构建可信赖计算机⁹的非常有趣的论文；如果你对密码学安全可信计算平台（如Palladium和TCPA）的替代方案感兴趣，我推荐你阅读它。）
- en: My best advice to aspiring hardware hackers is to be persistent and to be thorough.
    Significantly, persistence and thoroughness come naturally if you love what you
    are doing. Also, part of being a hardware hacker is being a pack rat. Buying new
    equipment is prohibitively expensive, so I accumulate broken and depreciated equipment
    and tools habitually, even if I don’t know exactly what I might do with them,
    or if I can fix them. It turns out that trying to fix test equipment is a learning
    experience in itself, and can be quite rewarding even if the conclusion is to
    junk the darn thing for spare parts.

  zh: 我对有志于成为硬件黑客的人的最佳建议是坚持不懈和彻底。值得注意的是，如果你热爱你所做的事情，坚持不懈和彻底会自然而然地发生。此外，成为一名硬件黑客的一部分是成为一个收藏家。购买新设备成本过高，所以我习惯性地积累破损和贬值的设备和工具，即使我不知道我可能用它们做什么，或者我能否修复它们。结果证明，尝试修复测试设备本身就是一种学习经历，即使最终结论是将其作为备件丢弃，也可以相当有成就感。

- en: In hardware hacking, half of your most difficult problems can be solved or made
    easier by just using the right selection of components or techniques. “Poop like
    an elephant” refers to sharing your information and discoveries with your fellow
    hackers. No matter how much information you digest, you can never know it all.
    Sharing your findings freely invites the advice and good will of fellow hackers
    and leads to a synergy of minds. Especially in hardware hacking where all results
    have a basis in tangible artifacts, hiding your techniques and results only means
    that other people will eventually re-invent your work without your help. On the
    other hand, do exercise some judgment in what you say or share; people only have
    so much bandwidth and they will listen more closely if you share results that
    are new or interesting in some way.

  zh: 在硬件黑客领域，你一半的难题可以通过仅仅使用正确的组件或技术选择来解决或变得更容易。 “像大象一样排泄”指的是与你的同行黑客分享你的信息和发现。无论你消化了多少信息，你永远无法知道一切。自由分享你的发现会吸引同行黑客的建议和善意，并导致思维上的协同效应。特别是在硬件黑客领域，所有结果都有可触摸的实物基础，隐藏你的技术和结果只会意味着其他人最终会在没有你的帮助下重新发明你的工作。另一方面，你在说或分享时也要做一些判断；人们只有那么多的带宽，如果你分享的结果在某些方面是新的或有趣的，他们会更仔细地听。
