- en: '![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1616079.png) I asked a psychiatric
    nurse practitioner about paranoia, and was told that “paranoiais the feeling that
    people are after you.” A medical dictionary would give you a slightly different
    definition, but this one is actually terribly useful for any system administrator.
    It’s not that everyone on the Internet is trying to attack you, but there’s always
    *someone* who wants to break into your system. Even if you think you have nothing
    of value, someone wants to own your computer. And you won’t realize the value
    of what you have until someone else has it. That’s just human nature.'

- en: In the 1970s, AT&T needed a lot of specialized, custom-written computer software
    to run its business. The company was forbidden to compete in the computer industry,
    so it could not sell this software. Instead, AT&T licensed its software and the
    related source code to universities for nominal sums. Universities saved money
    by using this software instead of commercial equivalents with pricey licenses,
    and university students got access to this nifty technology and could learn how
    everything worked. In return, AT&T got exposure, some pocket change, and a generation
    of computer scientists who had cut their teeth on AT&T technology. Everyone got
    something out of the deal.

    Thousands of students had access to its source code, however, and hundreds of
    teachers needed interesting projects for their students. If a program behaved
    oddly, or the operating system itself had a problem, the people who lived with
    the system had the tools and the motivation to fix it. Their efforts quickly improved
    UNIX and created many features we now take for granted. Students added the ability
    to control running processes, also known as *job control*. The UNIX S51K filesystem
    made system administrators wail and gnash their teeth, so they replaced it with
    the Fast File System (FFS), which introduced a whole host of features that have
    crept into every modern filesystem. Over the years, many small, useful programs
    were added to UNIX, and entire subsystems were replaced.

    Berkeley, acted as a central clearinghouse for UNIX code improvements from 1979
    to 1994\. The group collected changes from other universities, evaluated them,
    packaged them, and distributed the compilation for free to anyone with a valid
    AT&T UNIX license. The CSRG also contracted with the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency (DARPA) to implement various features in UNIX, such as TCP/IP.
    The resulting software collection came to be known as the Berkeley Software Distribution,
    or BSD. Users took the CSRG’s software, improved it further, and fed their improvements
    back into the CSRG. Today, we consider this a fairly standard way to run an open

- en: The OpenBSD community generally expects newcomers to be advanced computer users.
    The members have written extensive OpenBSD documentation, and expect newcomers
    to be willing to read it. They’re not interested in coddling new Unix users and,
    if pressed, will say so—often bluntly and forcefully. They will not hold your
    hand. They will not develop new features to please users. OpenBSD exists to meet
    the needs of the developers, and while others are welcome to ride along, the needs
    of the passengers do not steer the project.

    will leave every scrap of computing power possible for your applications. And
    after all, that’s what’s important—people use applications, not operating systems.

- en: OpenBSD strives to be the most secure operating system in the world. While it
    can reasonably make that claim today, maintaining that position requires constant
    effort. Intruders constantly try new ways to penetrate computers, which means
    that today’s feature might be tomorrow’s security problem. As OpenBSD developers
    learn of new classes of programming errors and security holes, they scan the entire
    source tree for that type of problem and make fixes before anyone even knows how
    these issues *might* be exploited.

  zh: OpenBSD 努力成为世界上最安全的操作系统。虽然它今天可以合理地提出这样的主张，但要保持这一地位需要持续的努力。入侵者不断尝试新的方法来渗透计算机，这意味着今天的特性可能成为明天的安全问题。当
    OpenBSD 开发者了解到新的编程错误类别和安全漏洞时，他们会扫描整个源代码树以查找这类问题，并在任何人甚至不知道这些问题*可能*如何被利用之前进行修复。
- en: Additionally, OpenBSD takes advantage of any security features offered by hardware.
    For example, AMD’s 64-bit Intel-compatible CPUs can mark a page of memory as either
    executable or writable, but not both. (Intel later copied this feature.) This
    alleviates many buffer overflow attacks, but the operating system must use this
    facility. OpenBSD supported this feature in 2003, shortly after the hardware was
    released. In fact, OpenBSD generally supports all hardware security features offered
    on a platform.

  zh: 此外，OpenBSD 充分利用硬件提供的任何安全特性。例如，AMD 的 64 位与 Intel 兼容的 CPU 可以将内存页面标记为可执行或可写，但不能同时两者都是。（Intel
    后来也复制了这一特性。）这减轻了许多缓冲区溢出攻击，但操作系统必须使用这一功能。OpenBSD 在 2003 年支持了这一特性，当时硬件刚刚发布。实际上，OpenBSD
    通常支持平台上提供的所有硬件安全特性。

    OpenBSD provides the web server with a stable, reliable platform, and will provide
