    communication was of necessity almost exclusively local. Messages were primarily
    oral, and even when in writing, they were rarely delivered a great distance. Most
    people never traveled far from their homes and rarely communicated with those
    distant from themselves. But even in ancient times, leaders used messengers to
    send short pieces of critical information from place to place. It was slow and
    unreliable, but some messages were important enough that an effort to communicate
    often had to be made despite the difficulties.

    resulting in the creation of physical mail systems. Today, these systems have

    by the standards of our modern world. For this reason, one of the most natural

    of a set of software running on the mainframe that implemented the entire email

    back a long way here) and RFC 155, describe physical mailing lists that were used
    for distributing documents in the early 1970s. It was this need to send documents

    in 1971\. It describes the *Mail Box Protocol*, a very rudimentary message transfer
    method using the predecessors of TCP/IP. This protocol was designed for the specific
    purpose of sending documents for remote printing. In those days, it was not as
    common for people to use computers at interactive terminals as it is today, but

    File Transfer Protocol (FTP). In 1980 the "Mail Transfer Protocol (MTP)" was published

    a distinction is made between protocols that deliver email between SMTP hosts
    on the internetwork and those that let users access received mail on their local
    hosts. To continue the postal mail analogy, different protocols are used for sending
    mail between post offices and for home delivery. As you'll see, this was done
    intentionally to make it possible to send mail to users, even if they are not
    connected to the Internet when the mail is sent. This decoupling is critical,

    to transmit it and received when the recipient wants to read it.

    (DNS) makes much of that obsolete, facilitating nearly immediate direct mail delivery
    in most cases. Early email supported only simple text, but we can now send graphical

    email system so that it can be processed (see [Chapter 76](ch76.html "Chapter 76. TCP/IP
    ELECTRONIC MAIL MESSAGE FORMATS AND MESSAGE PROCESSING: RFC 822 AND MIME")). It
    must also specify the email addresses of the intended recipients for the message
    (see [Chapter 75](ch75.html "Chapter 75. TCP/IP ELECTRONIC MAIL ADDRESSES AND

    to the network simultaneously, nor even continuously, to use it. The system is

    ignoring answering machines and voice mail of course!) Most TCP/IP protocols are

    before SMTP became widely deployed (again, it is still used, just not as much
    as before). The addresses in this system are specified as a path of hosts separated
    by exclamation marks (!). The path dictates the route that mail takes to get to
    a particular user, passing through a series of intermediate machines running UUCP.
    For example, if mail to joe at the host joesplace had to go through three hosts—host1,
    host2, and host3, the address would be host1!host2!host3!joesplace!joe. Since

    UUCP 的中间机器。例如，如果发送到 joesplace 主机上的 joe 的邮件必须通过三个主机——host1、host2 和 host3，那么地址将是
    host1!host2!host3!joesplace!joe。由于感叹号的俚语是 *bang*，因此这种表示法被称为 *bang path* 表示法。

    name address notation when DNS came into use. So you might have seen something

    an address: Does it mean to send mail first to host1 and then to user@domain?
    Or does it mean to first send it to the domain, which then goes to user at host1?
    There was no universal answer to this. The problem was mostly resolved both by

    Most TCP/IP protocols encode header information into a compact set of bytes that
    are read and understood based on their location in the message and the semantic
    meaning assigned to them. Consider IP, for example. The ninth byte of every IP
    datagram is the Time to Live (TTL) field, which is encoded as a value from 0 to
    255\. A device reading an IP datagram simply knows that byte number 9 contains
    the TTL value. If it sees the binary value 00010011 there, it knows the TTL value
    for this datagram is the decimal value 19.

    TTL 值。如果它在那里看到二进制值 00010011，它就知道这个数据报的 TTL 值是十进制的 19。

    *US-ASCII* by the standard), even the headers. Each line ends with an ASCII *carriage
    return (CR)* character, followed by a *line feed (LF)* character; the combination
    is collectively termed *CRLF*. Each line of text should be 78 or fewer characters
    (not including the terminating CRLF) and must not be more than 998 characters

    headers to be folded onto multiple lines if they are very lengthy. This is done
    by continuing a header value onto a new line, which must begin with at least one

    and other information needed for mail transport. For this reason, it is typical
    for an email message to be specified with enough header information to accomplish
    its own delivery. Email software can process and interpret the message to construct
    the necessary envelope for SMTP to transport the message to its destination mailbox.

    of computers and networking is today, almost everything back then was *small*.
    The networks were small; the number of users was small; the computing capabilities
    of networked hosts was small; the capacity of network connections was small; the

- en: As a result of this, the requirements for electronic mail messaging were also
    rather … small. Most computer input and output back then was text-based, and it
    was therefore natural that the creators of SMTP and the RFC 822 standard would

    RFC 822 to carry text messages.

    the entire internetwork was within American borders. Most people in the United
    States speak English, a language that as you may know uses a relatively small

- en: 'However, as computers developed, they moved away from a strict text model toward
    graphical operating systems. And predictably, users became interested in sending
    more than just text. They wanted to be able to transmit diagrams, non-ASCII text
    documents (such as Microsoft Word files), binary program files, and eventually
    multimedia information: digital photographs, MP3 audio clips, slide presentations,

    this header tells the recipient of the email message what sort of media it contains
    and whether the body uses a simple or complex structure. In a body part, it describes
    the media type the body part contains. For example, a message containing an HTML
    document might have a Content-Type header of `text/html`, where a message containing
    a JPEG graphical file might be specified as image/jpeg. For a composite MIME type,
    the Content-Type header of the whole message will contain something like `multipart/mixed`
    or `multipart/alternative`, and each body part will contain individual Content-Type
    headers such as `text/html` or `image/jpeg`. These are all discussed in detail
    in the next two sections. This header is optional. When not present, the default
