    coming into Santa Barbara using two side-by-side phone booths on the beach and
    some very simple phone phreaking equipment. When people tried to call into Santa
    Barbara, their calls were rerouted to the two phreakers, who told all callers

    out in a freakish nuclear accident; a "nuclear meltdown," they told her. She was

    as you like until the victim receives the next billing statement and notices your
    mysterious phone calls. Of course, once the victim notifies the phone company,
    that calling card number is usually canceled. (Since shoulder surfing involves
    stealing from individuals, true phone phreakers look down on it as an activity
    unworthy of anyone but common thieves and juvenile delinquents. True phone pheakers
    only believe in stealing service from the telephone company, and even then they
    don't feel that they're actually causing any harm or costing the company any money.)

    whistle different tones or use additional color boxes to emit tones that would

- en: Since a cloned phone can only be used until the real cell phone owner notices
    the outrageous number of additional calls showing up on the bill, some thieves
    resort to a technique known as *tumbling*. Originally, tumbling meant using a
    random ESN and MIN number to make a free call. Once the cell phone company received
    these random ESN/MIN numbers, they had to validate these numbers. Since this process
    could take time, the cell phone companies often let random ESN/MIN numbers get
    one free phone call without validating the numbers. Eventually, the cell phone
    companies could validate ESN/MIN numbers almost instantaneously, so tumbling took
    a new form where a thief steals multiple combinations of valid ESN/MIN numbers
    and uses a different one each time he makes a phone call. Tumbling spreads out
    the number of illegal phone calls among a large number of legitimate cell phone
    owners, who are more likely to accept (or not notice) one or two strange calls
    rather than dozens each month.

    for minutes on a cell phone calling plan when you can make that same phone call
    over a VoIP phone for a fixed monthly rate? Perhaps all the phone phreaking tricks
    previously done on cell phones will trickle down to mobile VoIP phones too.

- en: Say, for example, a hacker wants someone's password at a particular company.
    Rather than ask that person directly (which would probably fail), he might try
    a more easily manipulated source, such as a secretary. The hacker could deliberately
    foul up a computer at that company, then call the secretary (while masquerading
    as a technician), and ask if she has noticed any problems with the computer. When
    the secretary says yes, the "technician" claims that fixing the problem requires
    the (desired) password. More often than not, the secretary will give out this
    password and the "technician" will fix the very problem that he created in the
    first place. The computer problem "mysteriously" disappears and the secretary
    thinks that everything is now okay, not realizing that she has just given her
    boss's password to a hacker. The secretary suffers no loss, and the password's
    owner is unaware that it's been stolen.

    directly. For example, a hacker might discover the phone number to a corporate
    technical support line, then reroute those calls to herself. When the target finds
    that his computer is suddenly not working, he calls technical support. The hacker
    answers the line and asks for the target's password. Since the target initiated
    the call, he will likely supply any information requested just to get his computer
    working again. Once the target gives the hacker the password, the hacker "fixes"
    the computer, and the problem once again "mysteriously" disappears. The hacker
    has succeeded in obtaining the password, and the target never realizes that he
    gave it away.

    dumpster diving may not yield enough information. In those cases, hackers might
    take the riskier path of dressing up as janitors, temporary workers, or new employees
    and physically wandering around the premises, noting what they see and where equipment
    is located. If this surveillance takes place after hours or during lunch, hackers
    can even peek inside workers' desks and examine computers. With physical access,
    hackers can try to access a network from a trusted computer, or install a keystroke
    logging program to snare the users' passwords as they type them in (see [Chapter 9](ch09.html

    a rapport with him or her (perhaps by making fun of his own boss in a way that
    the secretary might relate to), the hacker can erase any suspicions. This works

    Since helping others—especially someone perceived as trustworthy—can make people

    its two halves is flush with the plug. If a pin isn't held in place, it will fall
    back down, so lockpickers twist the plug slightly to one side to create a ridge.
    Once the lockpicker has pushed the halves of a single pin flush with the plug,
    a slight twist pushes the pin sideways so that, instead of falling back in place
    (and locking), the tip of the pin half rests on the ridge of the twisted plug

  zh: 如果一个国家的公民了解到关于前政府可能令人不安的事实，这会不会削弱他们对当前政府的信心和信仰？或许会，这正是历史教科书在塑造未来一代思想方面如此重要的原因。马萨诸塞大学日本历史学教授、著有《胜利者的正义：东京战争罪行》和《苏斯博士去打仗》一书的理查德·H·迈纳教授这样回答了这个问题：“作为一名实践中的历史学家，我在每个转折点都遇到了教科书对学生思想的影响力……我们的学生坚信他们在教科书中读到的一切。”
- en: 'Fujioka Nobukatsu, a professor of education at Tokyo University, decided to
    "correct history" by emphasizing a "positive view" of Japan''s past and removing
    any textbook references to what he calls "dark history." Fujioka formed the Japanese
    Society for History Textbook Reform ([www.tsukurukai.com](http://www.tsukurukai.com)),
    which published *The New History Textbook*. This textbook ignited controversy
    in China, North and South Korea, and even in Japan itself with claims that the
    Japanese military tried to liberate Asia from Western colonization during World
    War II, as the following excerpt shows:'

  zh: 东京大学教育学教授藤冈信胜决定通过强调日本过去的“积极观点”并删除他所说的“黑暗历史”的任何教科书引用来“纠正历史”。藤冈成立了日本历史教科书改革协会（[www.tsukurukai.com](http://www.tsukurukai.com)），并出版了《新历史教科书》。这本教科书在中国、朝鲜半岛以及日本国内都引发了争议，声称日本军队在二战期间试图从西方殖民统治下解放亚洲，以下为相关摘录：
- en: When Japanese troops occupied in 1942, having defeated Dutch forces, Indonesians
    lined the roads and cheered. Japanese forces were a liberating army to rid them
    of the Dutch. During the occupation, which lasted three and a half years, the
    Japanese trained PETA, a military force, opened middle schools, and established
    a common language. The many reforms implemented served as a foundation for future
    independence. But when war neared its end and food was scarce, Japanese military
    police sometimes forced locals to do harsh labor, and were cruel to the local
    people in other ways as well.

  zh: 当1942年日军占领，击败荷兰军队后，印度尼西亚人沿着道路欢呼。日军是一支解放军队，帮助他们摆脱荷兰的统治。在持续了三年半的占领期间，日军训练了PETA（一支军事力量），开设了中学，并建立了一种共同语言。实施的多项改革为未来的独立奠定了基础。但当战争临近尾声，食物稀缺时，日军警察有时强迫当地人做苦力，并以其他方式残酷对待当地人民。

  zh: 重写的历史不仅可以重新解释过去，还可以完全抹去它。例如，在1998年3月2日的《时代》杂志上，当时的总统乔治·H·W·布什和他的国家安全顾问布伦特·斯考克罗夫特发表了一篇题为“为什么我们没有推翻萨达姆”的文章，阐述了总统在伊拉克第一次战争后留下萨达姆·侯赛因在权力位置的正当性：
- en: While we hoped that popular revolt or coup would topple Saddam, neither the
    U.S. nor the countries of the region wished to see the breakup of the Iraqi state.
    We were concerned about the long-term balance of power at the head of the Gulf.
    Trying to eliminate Saddam . . .would have incurred incalculable human and political
    costs. . . . We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule
    Iraq. The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in
    anger and other allies pulling out as well. . . .Going in and occupying Iraq,
    thus unilaterally exceeding the U.N.'s mandate, would have destroyed the precedent
    of international response to aggression we hoped to establish. Had we gone the
    invasion route, the U.S. could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly
    hostile land.

  zh: 当我们希望民众起义或政变推翻萨达姆时，美国和该地区的国家都不希望看到伊拉克国家的分裂。我们担心海湾地区的长期力量平衡。试图消除萨达姆……将承担无法估量的巨大的人力和政治代价……我们将被迫占领巴格达，实际上统治伊拉克。联军将立即崩溃，阿拉伯人愤怒地退出，其他盟友也会撤出……单方面进入并占领伊拉克，超出了联合国授权的范围，将破坏我们希望建立的针对侵略的国际反应先例。如果我们选择了入侵路线，美国可能仍然是一个在充满敌意的土地上占领的权力。
