- en: Xbox hackers are an anarchistic community that works mostly underground, keeping
    in touch and sharing information through various Internet “fora” (fora is the
    plural of forum, as data is the plural of datum). Most of the Xbox hacking community
    keeps a low profile, and hackers often use pseudonyms to protect their identities.
    The reasons for using pseudonyms varies, but in general anonymity carries the
    benefit of greater operating freedom. Hackers are more inclined to share their
    results and findings if they know they can back away unscathed in case things
    get ugly. The use of pseudonyms also levels the playing field. Hackers judge each
    other primarily on the basis of the quality and frequency of their contributions,
    and little else. The fact that you may be young does not detract from your first
    impression or street credibility, as it might in other situations. Likewise, many
    hackers have no qualms about being blunt when you’ve made an error, and they have
    even less patience for stupidity presented as erudition or rude assertions. On
    the other hand, many hackers are more than happy to extend a hand to those who
    have made an honest effort to read the FAQs, search the web and general y try
    their best to check and make sure that the question hasn’t already been answered.

  zh: Xbox 漏洞挖掘者是一个无政府主义社区，他们主要在地下活动，通过各种互联网“论坛”（fora 是 forum 的复数形式，就像 data 是 datum
    的复数形式）保持联系和分享信息。Xbox 漏洞挖掘社区中的大多数人保持低调，黑客们经常使用化名来保护他们的身份。使用化名的理由各不相同，但总的来说，匿名提供了更大的操作自由。如果黑客知道在事情变得糟糕的情况下可以无损退出，他们更愿意分享他们的成果和发现。使用化名也使竞争更加公平。黑客们主要根据他们贡献的质量和频率来评判彼此，其他方面很少考虑。你可能很年轻，但这并不会影响你的第一印象或街头信誉，就像在其他情况下可能会发生的那样。同样，许多黑客在你犯错时毫不犹豫地直言不讳，他们对愚蠢地表现为博学或无礼的断言更是没有耐心。另一方面，许多黑客对那些已经诚心诚意地阅读常见问题解答、搜索网络并尽力确保问题尚未被回答的人非常乐意伸出援手。

    the Xbox, Google is becoming an increasingly important tool for casting a wide

    the de facto jargon and spelling is for your concept. Suppose you are looking
    for information on the new Xbox security system. If you search on **new Xbox**,

- en: For some time, I had been interested in electronics hacking, though for the
    most part my interest had been limited to merely reading about such feats. Hacked
    devices such as Sega’s Dreamcast and the Netpliance I-Opener had caught my attention
    from time to time. However, my first real experience with electronics hacking
    came with the “ePods,” a discontinued internet appliance/web-tablet device. I
    read about these interesting devices online and found my way to Ken Segler’s I-Appliance
    BBS (http://www.linux-hacker.net), home of the famous I-Opener hacks. After reading
    about the neat things people were doing with these tablets, I was intrigued and
    spent a good deal of my saved up money at the time ($200) on one of the units.
    After receiving my new toy, I spent a lot of time performing many of the documented
    hacks, mostly software based. This was to be my first glimpse into the world of
    electronics hacking. After the ePods, I moved on to another internet appliance,
    the Gateway Connected Touchpad. A slick-looking 10" touchscreen with a 400MHz
    Crusoe and 96MB RAM housed behind it; it looked like a great deal and perfect
    for a fun project. The device ran a custom build of Linux for AOL off of a 32MB
    CompactFlash card. I swapped this out with a Microdrive and after much swapping
    of this disk between laptops and USB readers and the Gateway, the device booted
    a pared down version of Windows using “98Lite.” The device seemed perfect for
    use as a finger-operated, network-attached mp3 jukebox (among other things) so
    I began working on a custom player that would allow easy operation via the touchpad.
    The whole Gateway experience made for a neat summer project between my Junior
    and Senior years of high school.

  zh: 在一段时间里，我对电子黑客技术很感兴趣，尽管我的兴趣主要局限于仅仅阅读关于这些壮举的文章。像世嘉的Dreamcast和Netpliance I-Opener这样的被黑设备时不时地吸引了我的注意。然而，我第一次真正的电子黑客体验来自于“ePods”，这是一种已经停止生产的互联网设备/网络平板电脑。我在网上阅读了关于这些有趣设备的文章，并找到了Ken
    Segler的I-Appliance BBS（http://www.linux-hacker.net），这是著名的I-Opener黑客的家园。在阅读了人们用这些平板电脑做的一些有趣的事情后，我感到非常好奇，并花了我当时大部分积蓄（200美元）购买了一个单元。收到我的新玩具后，我花了很多时间进行许多记录在案的破解，主要是基于软件的。这是我第一次窥见电子黑客的世界。在ePods之后，我转向了另一款互联网设备，Gateway
    Connected Touchpad。一个看起来很酷的10英寸触摸屏，背后有一个400MHz的Crusoe处理器和96MB的RAM；它看起来像是一笔不错的交易，非常适合一个有趣的项目。该设备运行的是基于32MB
    CompactFlash卡的AOL定制的Linux系统。我将这个Microdrive换掉，并在笔记本电脑、USB读卡器和Gateway之间多次交换这个磁盘后，设备启动了一个精简版的Windows使用“98Lite”。这个设备似乎非常适合用作手指操作的、网络连接的mp3音乐播放器（以及其他用途），所以我开始开发一个定制的播放器，它可以通过触摸板轻松操作。整个Gateway体验成为了我在高中junior和senior年之间的一个有趣的项目。

- en: It was during this time period that I got the idea for XboxHacker.Net. To me,
    the Xbox seemed to have the potential to be the ideal computing device for under
    the TV . . . as soon as it could be programmed. The hardware was most impressive
    for the time, and more than adequate for what I hoped would be accomplished on
    the device. Unlike other consoles, the Xbox also was to have a hard drive and
    ethernet port built in. Once hacked, the Xbox could be used to emulate old consoles
    such as NES, SNES, N64, and even PSX, to conveniently play back any type of media
    file, such as mp3s or DivXs, on your home entertainment system, to play streamed
    media from a home network, or even to double as a basic PC. Some argued that the
    cost of the device at $299 made it out of range to bother hacking, as a PC with
    similar specs could be constructed without the need for hacking for not much more
    in cost. However, the Xbox had the advantage that it could also play Xbox games
    and was already designed to sit with your TV. The hacks would just be added value.
    After my short foray into the world of electronics hacking, I thought that hacking
    the Xbox could be an interesting project to help organize as I was intrigued by
    the possibility of having a convenient box for my TV to perform the tasks mentioned
    above. It was not until many months later that I would actually acquire the XboxHacker.Net
    domains.

- en: The XboxHacking scene picked up pace fairly rapidly after the public availability
    of modchips near summer 2002\. By this time, the Xbox security system had been
    cracked by multiple groups and it was only a matter of time before modchips were
    readily available to the public. At this point, the work shifted away from hardware
    hacking for the most part and more towards software development. A sister site
    to XboxHacker.Net, XboxDeveloper (http://www.xboxdeveloper.net) was started to
    help catalog the software that became available for the Xbox, though it never
    took off to the level that XboxHacker.Net did. Using leaked copies of the Microsoft
    Xbox SDK, programmers began writing and porting various applications for the Xbox,
    including media players and emulators such as MAME. The Xbox-Linux project (http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/)
    under the leadership of Michael Steil, successfully allowed the Linux operating
    system to run on the Xbox. I pushed to start the OpenXDK project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openxdk/),
    an open source developer kit that would allow development of software for the
    Xbox unhindered by legal issues, though that project has met with only mixed success.
    It is now under the leadership of “Caustik” (Aaron Robinson), a CS student at
    Case Western University. Due to the more accessible nature of software development
    compared with hardware hacking, the number of contributing members to the general
    XboxHacking effort increased rapidly. The amount of “homebrew” software available
    for the Xbox today is amazing and includes everything from media players, console
    emulators, and utilities to originally written games.

    Xbox SDK副本，程序员开始编写和移植各种Xbox应用程序，包括媒体播放器和MAME这样的模拟器。在Michael Steil的领导下，Xbox-Linux项目（http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/）成功地将Linux操作系统运行在Xbox上。我推动启动了OpenXDK项目（http://sourceforge.net/projects/openxdk/），这是一个开源的开发工具包，将允许为Xbox开发软件而不受法律问题的阻碍，尽管这个项目只取得了部分成功。现在它由“Caustik”（Aaron
    Robinson）领导，他是凯斯西储大学的一名计算机科学学生。由于软件开发与硬件破解相比更具可访问性，为XboxHacking贡献的成员数量迅速增加。今天可用的Xbox“自制”软件数量惊人，包括媒体播放器、控制台模拟器、实用程序以及原创游戏。

    Trusted PCs can also be used to securely store sensitive data, such as your medical

    of trusted PCs is to reliably enforce digital content access rights and management
    policies upon users. The digital rights management (DRM) aspect of trusted computing

    benefits of pseudo-free content and flexible copyright implementations. The fundamental
    problem is not the existence of content management policies — indeed, content
    management policy can be beneficial for consumers. The real problem is when the
    policies which govern your rights can be set unilateral y by content providers.

    certain key secrets inside their machines. Instead, the attestation information
    (information required to establish trustability) of a user’s machine is partial
    y maintained by a third party. Can we rely on a non-elected, unregulated third

    how every memory location in a conventional error-correcting memory implementation
    is associated with some ECC bits. Tag bits help the hardware enforce data type
    management policies; for example, a memory location tagged as piece of data can
    never be accidentally or intentionally executed as code. A capability is a pointer
    granted by a trusted kernel that cannot be forged. The unforgeability property
    is preferably enforced by hardware through tag bits. Many architectures also include
    the ability to enforce access boundaries as part of a hardware capability.¹ Capabilities
    and memory tags are not new ideas; in 1961, the Burroughs B5000 used capabilities

- en: This device is more powerful than the SPIOS since it works on a system that
    is powered-up and supposedly trustworthy. It can be applied to effectively defeat
    a wider range of DRM schemes as well as some authenticated transactions between
    the local machine and the server. SPAM alone cannot be used, however, to falsely
    identify a system as another registered, trusted system, since SPAM lacks the
    secret shared between the tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule in the local machine
    and the authentication server. False system identification would require either
    extracting the key from a tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule (possible, but
    not trivial and most likely destructive to the module), or somehow tricking a
    secure cryptomodule from another registered, trusted machine into providing the
    falsified identity.

  zh: 与SPIOS相比，该设备更强大，因为它在已启动并被认为是可信的系统上工作。它可以有效地对抗更广泛的DRM方案，以及本地机器和服务器之间的一些认证交易。然而，仅使用SPAM本身并不能将系统错误地识别为另一个已注册、受信任的系统，因为SPAM缺乏本地机器中防篡改安全加密模块和认证服务器之间共享的秘密。错误的系统识别可能需要从防篡改安全加密模块中提取密钥（可能，但不是简单的事情，并且很可能会破坏模块），或者以某种方式欺骗另一个已注册、受信任机器上的安全加密模块以提供伪造的身份。
- en: The SPAM device can be manufactured for relatively little (high performance
    FPGAs can cost as little as $50 today in single quantities), and can be very easy
    to install. The SPAM can be either integrated directly into a memory module (in
    which case it functions as both a trust violation device and as a memory expansion
    device), or it can be provided as a device that is installed in a stacked configuration
    in between the motherboard’s memory slot and the existing memory device. In some
    memory card configurations, particularly ones that employ heat shields, it may
    be possible to hide the SPAM device and pass the module off as a regular memory
    expansion device. While elaborate, this may be a worthwhile attack against a large
    corporation or bank that stores high-value secrets on a trusted PC-based server.

  zh: SPAM设备可以以相对较低的成本（高性能FPGA今天单件价格低至50美元）制造，并且安装非常简单。SPAM可以直接集成到内存模块中（在这种情况下，它既作为信任违规设备，也作为内存扩展设备使用），或者作为安装在主板内存插槽和现有内存设备之间的堆叠配置的设备。在某些内存卡配置中，尤其是使用散热罩的配置，可能隐藏SPAM设备并将模块伪装成常规内存扩展设备。虽然这种方法很复杂，但对于存储在受信任的PC服务器上高价值机密的跨国公司或银行来说，这可能是一种值得尝试的攻击手段。

- en: When considering the prospect of trusted computing, we need to first consider
    whether the currently proposed schemes will offer all the benefits that they promise,
    and then weigh those against the potential harm to consumers’ rights and the potential
    benefits to criminals (enhanced privacy can be used for both good and ill). If
    trusted computing could provide perfect security for online businesses, then that
    might be worth the potential risks. However, the scenarios outlined in this chapter
    indicate that the trusted PC’s security may be less than perfect.

- en: Consider the Xbox. The Xbox is a trusted PC implementation that can be hacked
    with just a $50 solderless module. This places a fairly strong bound on the value
    of secrets that can be trusted to an Xbox. Hardware modchips are so inexpensive
    that they pay for themselves with the cost of a copied game title, or two games
    if you elect to pay someone to install the chip for you.

    too, as well as new legislation, such as the DMCA, which aims in part to make
    such acts a crime. Unfortunately, the current trusted PC proposals on the table

- en: The fact of the matter is that hacking technology will be developed whether
    or not it is illegal, and whether or not the intention is good or evil. Thus,
    it is in the best interests of consumers and companies to educate the population
    about hacking, and for everyone to understand the limitations of their “trusted
    PC.” The worst-case scenario would be if billions of dollars were invested in
    trusted computing, only produce a net result of no greater safety or privacy for

- en: The good news for trusted PC proponents is that shrinking feature sizes in integrated
    circuits is driving greater integration throughout the PC. Within a decade, today’s
    PC will fit on a single piece of silicon. Once the RAM and the BIOS are fully
    integrated into a single piece of silicon, hacking a system becomes much more
    difficult — but not impossible. Focused Ion Beam (FIB) machines, a tool used by
    chip designers and failure analysis labs, can cut and jumper nano-scale features.
    Another upside for for trusted machine designers is that public key processors
    could become so small and cheap to integrate into a chip that individual chips,
    especially memory chips, could start using strong crypto to authenticate and encrypt
    their I/O.

- en: Another technology that could aid the implementation of trusted PCs is integrated
    tamper-resistant or tamper-detecting features. For example, a time-domain reflectometer
    (TDR) could be built into a chip’s I/O cells. A TDR can detect the presence of
    an eavesdropper on a wire by recognizing certain changes to the wire’s electrical
    properties. In addition to the ability to detect eavesdroppers, integrated TDR
    devices are desirable for high performance I/O since they can be used to calibrate
    the drive impedance and equalization/pre-emphasis filters required for multi-gigabit
    speed communications.
