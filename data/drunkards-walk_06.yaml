    In my experience teaching, though I have had some polite students come up to me
    to explain why they were dropping my course, I have never had a student feel the
    need to explain why he was taking it. That’s probably why I can get away with
    happily assuming that if asked, such a student would respond, “Because I am fascinated
    by the subject, and you are a fine lecturer.” But this student had other reasons.
    He said he needed help because strange things were happening to him: his wife
    spoke the words he was thinking before he could say them, and now she was divorcing
    him; a co-worker casually mentioned layoffs over drinks, and two days later the
    student lost his job. Over time, he reported, he had experienced dozens of misfortunes
    and what he considered to be disturbing coincidences.'

    a park in London called Bunhill Fields, in the same grave as his father, Joshua,
    also a minister. And he indeed did invent a theory of “conditional probability”
    to show how the theory of probability can be extended from independent events
    to events whose outcomes are connected. For example, the probability that a randomly
    chosen person is mentally ill and the probability that a randomly chosen person
    believes his spouse can read his mind are both very low, but the probability that
    a person is mentally ill *if* he believes his spouse can read his mind is much

- en: The effect on the probability that an event will occur *if* or *given that*
    other events occur is what Bayes’s theory is all about. To see in detail how it
    works, we’ll turn to another problem, one that is related to the two-daughter
    problem we encountered in chapter 3\. Let us now suppose that a distant cousin
    has two children. Recall that in the two-daughter problem you know that one or
    both are girls, and you are trying to remember which it is—one or both? In a family
    with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that
    both children are girls? We didn’t discuss the question in those terms in chapter
    3, but the *if* makes this a problem in conditional probability. If that *if*
    clause were not present, the chances that both children were girls would be 1
    in 4, the 4 possible birth orders being (boy, boy), (boy, girl), (girl, boy),
    and (girl, girl). But given the additional information that the family has a girl,
    the chances are 1 in 3\. That is because if one of the children is a girl, there
    are just 3 possible scenarios for this family—(boy, girl), (girl, boy), and (girl,
    girl)—and exactly 1 of the 3 corresponds to the outcome that both children are
    girls. That’s probably the simplest way to look at Bayes’s ideas—they are just
    a matter of accounting. First write down the sample space—that is, the list of
    all the possibilities—along with their probabilities if they are not all equal
    (that is actually a good idea in analyzing any confusing probability issue). Next,
    cross off the possibilities that the condition (in this case, “at least one girl”)
    eliminates. What is left are the remaining possibilities and their relative probabilities.

  zh: 事件发生的概率，无论是基于其他事件发生还是给定其他事件发生，这正是贝叶斯理论的核心。为了详细了解它是如何工作的，我们将转向另一个问题，这个问题与我们第3章遇到的双胞胎问题相关。现在假设一个远房表亲有两个孩子。回想一下，在双胞胎问题中，你知道其中一个是或两个是女孩，你试图记住是哪一个——一个还是两个？在一个有两个孩子的家庭中，如果一个孩子是女孩，那么两个孩子都是女孩的概率是多少？我们在第3章没有用这种方式讨论这个问题，但“如果”这个词使得这个问题成为了一个条件概率问题。如果没有这个“如果”条款，两个孩子都是女孩的概率是1/4，4种可能的出生顺序是（男孩，男孩）、（男孩，女孩）、（女孩，男孩）和（女孩，女孩）。但考虑到额外的信息，即这个家庭有一个女孩，概率是1/3。这是因为如果一个孩子是女孩，这个家庭只有3种可能的情景——（男孩，女孩）、（女孩，男孩）和（女孩，女孩）——而这3种情景中恰好有1种对应两个孩子都是女孩的结果。这可能是在看贝叶斯思想时最简单的方法——它们只是会计问题。首先写下样本空间——即所有可能性的列表——以及如果它们不相等时它们的概率（实际上在分析任何复杂的概率问题时这也是一个好主意）。然后，划掉条件（在这种情况下，“至少有一个女孩”）所排除的可能性。剩下的就是剩余的可能性和它们的相对概率。

- en: Bayes approached the problem via a metaphor.[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts4a)
    Imagine we are supplied with a square table and two balls. We roll the first ball
    onto the table in a manner that makes it equally probable that the ball will come
    to rest at any point. Our job is to determine, without looking, where along the
    left-right axis the ball stopped. Our tool in this is the second ball, which we
    may repeatedly roll onto the table in the same manner as the first. With each
    roll a collaborator notes whether that ball comes to rest to the right or the
    left of the place where the first ball landed. At the end he informs us of the
    total number of times the second ball landed in each of the two general locations.
    The first ball represents the unknown that we wish to gain information about,
    and the second ball represents the evidence we manage to obtain. If the second
    ball lands consistently to the right of the first, we can be pretty confident
    that the first ball rests toward the far left side of the table. If it lands less
    consistently to the right, we might be less confident of that conclusion, or we
    might guess that the first ball is situated farther to the right. Bayes showed
    how to determine, based on the data of the second ball, the precise probability
    that the first ball is at any given point on the left-right axis. And he showed
    how, given additional data, one should revise one’s initial estimate. In Bayesian
    terminology the initial estimates are called prior probabilities and the new guesses,
    posterior probabilities.

  zh: 贝叶斯通过一个隐喻来处理这个问题。[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts4a) 想象我们被提供了一张方桌和两个球。我们以使球在任何位置停下来都有相同可能性的方式将第一个球滚到桌子上。我们的任务是确定，不查看，球在左右轴上的哪个位置停下来。我们在这个任务中的工具是第二个球，我们可以以与第一个球相同的方式反复将第二个球滚到桌子上。每次滚动，合作者都会记录第二个球是否落在第一个球落下的位置的右侧或左侧。最后，他告诉我们第二个球落在两个一般位置中的总次数。第一个球代表我们希望获取信息的未知因素，第二个球代表我们设法获得的证据。如果第二个球始终落在第一个球的右侧，我们可以相当自信地认为第一个球位于桌子的远左侧。如果它落在右侧的次数不太一致，我们可能对这个结论不太自信，或者我们可能会猜测第一个球位于更右侧的位置。贝叶斯展示了如何根据第二个球的数据确定第一个球在左右轴上的任何给定点的精确概率。他还展示了在给定更多数据的情况下，如何修正最初的估计。在贝叶斯术语中，最初的估计被称为先验概率，而新的猜测被称为后验概率。
- en: Bayes concocted this game because it models many of the decisions we make in
    life. In the drug-trial example the position of the first ball represents the
    drug’s true effectiveness, and the reports regarding the second ball represent
    the patient data. The position of the first ball could also represent a film’s
    appeal, product quality, driving skill, hard work, stubbornness, talent, ability,
    or whatever it is that determines the success or failure of a certain endeavor.
    The reports on the second ball would then represent our observations or the data
    we collect. Bayes’s theory shows how to make assessments and then adjust them
    in the face of new data.

- en: 'Today Bayesian analysis is widely employed throughout science and industry.
    For instance, models employed to determine car insurance rates include a mathematical
    function describing, per unit of driving time, your personal probability of having
    zero, one, or more accidents. Consider, for our purposes, a simplified model that
    places everyone in one of two categories: high risk, which includes drivers who
    average at least one accident each year, and low risk, which includes drivers
    who average less than one. If, when you apply for insurance, you have a driving
    record that stretches back twenty years without an accident or one that goes back
    twenty years with thirty-seven accidents, the insurance company can be pretty
    sure which category to place you in. But if you are a new driver, should you be
    classified as low risk (a kid who obeys the speed limit and volunteers to be the
    designated driver) or high risk (a kid who races down Main Street swigging from
    a half-empty $2 bottle of Boone’s Farm apple wine)? Since the company has no data
    on you—no idea of the “position of the first ball”—it might assign you an equal
    prior probability of being in either group, or it might use what it knows about
    the general population of new drivers and start you off by guessing that the chances
    you are a high risk are, say, 1 in 3\. In that case the company would model you
    as a hybrid—one-third high risk and two-thirds low risk—and charge you one-third
    the price it charges high-risk drivers plus two-thirds the price it charges low-risk
    drivers. Then, after a year of observation—that is, after one of Bayes’s second
    balls has been thrown—the company can employ the new datum to reevaluate its model,
    adjust the one-third and two-third proportions it previously assigned, and recalculate
    what it ought to charge. If you have had no accidents, the proportion of low risk
    and low price it assigns you will increase; if you have had two accidents, it
    will decrease. The precise size of the adjustment is given by Bayes’s theory.
    In the same manner the insurance company can periodically adjust its assessments
    in later years to reflect the fact that you were accident-free or that you twice
    had an accident while driving the wrong way down a one-way street, holding a cell
    phone with your left hand and a doughnut with your right. That is why insurance
    companies can give out “good driver” discounts: the absence of accidents elevates
    the posterior probability that a driver belongs in a low-risk group.'

  zh: 今天，贝叶斯分析在科学和工业领域得到了广泛应用。例如，用于确定汽车保险费率的模型包括一个数学函数，该函数描述了每单位驾驶时间内，你发生零起、一起或多起事故的个人概率。为了我们的目的，考虑一个简化的模型，该模型将每个人归入两个类别之一：高风险，包括每年平均至少发生一起事故的驾驶员，和低风险，包括每年平均发生事故少于一起的驾驶员。如果你申请保险时，你的驾驶记录在过去二十年里没有发生过事故，或者有二十年的记录中发生了三十七起事故，保险公司可以相当肯定地将你归入哪个类别。但是，如果你是一个新手驾驶员，你应该被归类为低风险（一个遵守速度限制并自愿担任指定驾驶员的孩子）还是高风险（一个在主街上赛车，喝着半满的2美元一瓶的布恩农场苹果酒的孩子）？由于公司没有你的数据——没有“第一个球的位置”——它可能会给你分配在两个群体中的等先验概率，或者它可能会利用它对新手驾驶员总体情况的了解，并假设你是一个高风险的概率是，比如说，三分之一。在这种情况下，公司会将你建模为一个混合体——三分之一高风险和三分之二低风险——并收取相当于高风险驾驶员三分之一的价格加上低风险驾驶员三分之二的价格。然后，经过一年的观察——也就是说，在贝叶斯第二个球被投掷之后——公司可以利用新的数据重新评估其模型，调整之前分配的三分之一和三分之二的比例，并重新计算它应该收取的费用。如果你没有发生过事故，你被分配的低风险和低价格的比例将增加；如果你发生了两起事故，这个比例将减少。调整的确切大小由贝叶斯理论给出。以同样的方式，保险公司可以在以后的年份定期调整其评估，以反映你无事故或你在单行道上逆向行驶时发生两次事故的事实，左手拿着手机，右手拿着甜甜圈。这就是为什么保险公司可以发放“优秀驾驶员”折扣：事故的缺失提高了驾驶员属于低风险群体的后验概率。

    knowledge of the false positive rate is not sufficient to determine the usefulness
    of a test—you must also know how the false-positive rate compares with the true
    prevalence of the disease. If the disease is rare, even a low false-positive rate
    does not mean that a positive test implies you have the disease. If a disease
    is common, a positive result is much more likely to be meaningful. To see how

    now that I had been homosexual and tested positive. Assume that in the male gay

    在医学界，不考虑到这一点是一个常见的错误。例如，在德国和美国的调查研究中，研究人员要求医生估计在40至50岁之间、乳腺钼靶检查结果为阳性但实际没有癌症的无症状女性的乳腺癌概率，当7%的钼靶检查显示癌症时。[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts8a)
    此外，医生被告知实际发病率约为0.8%，假阴性率约为10%。将这些信息综合起来，可以使用贝叶斯方法确定，只有大约9%的阳性乳腺钼靶检查是由癌症引起的。然而，在德国小组中，有三分之一的医生认为概率约为90%，中位估计值为70%。在美国小组中，95位医生中有95位估计概率约为75%。
- en: Similar issues arise in drug testing in athletes. Here again, the oft-quoted
    but not directly relevant number is the false positive rate. This gives a distorted
    view of the probability that an athlete is guilty. For example, Mary Decker Slaney,
    a world-class runner and 1983 world champion in the 1,500 and 3,000 meter race,
    was trying to make a comeback when, at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Atlanta in 1996,
    she was accused of doping violations consistent with testosterone use. After various
    deliberations, the IAAF (known officially since 2001 as the International Association
    of Athletics Federations) ruled that Slaney “was guilty of a doping offense,”
    effectively ending her career. According to some of the testimony in the Slaney
    case the false-positive rate for the test to which her urine was subjected could
    have been as high as 1 percent. This probably made many people comfortable that
    her chance of guilt was 99 percent, but as we have seen that is not true. Suppose,
    for example, 1,000 athletes were tested, 1 in 10 was guilty, and the test, when
    given to a guilty athlete, had a 50 percent chance of revealing the doping violation.
    Then for every thousand athletes tested, 100 would have been guilty and the test
    would have fingered 50 of those. Meanwhile, of the 900 athletes who are innocent,
    the test would have fingered 9\. So what a positive-doping test really meant was
    not that the probability she was guilty was 99 percent, but rather [50]/[59] =
    84.7 percent. Put another way, you should have about as much confidence that Slaney
    was guilty based on that evidence as you would that the number 1 won’t turn up
    when she tossed a die. That certainly leaves room for reasonable doubt, and, more
    important, indicates that to perform mass testing (90,000 athletes have their
    urine tested annually) and make judgments based on such a procedure means to condemn
    a large number of innocent people.[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts9a)

  zh: 在运动员的药物检测中也出现了类似的问题。在这里，经常引用但并不直接相关的数字是假阳性率。这给运动员有罪的概率提供了一个扭曲的视角。例如，玛丽·德克·斯莱尼是一位世界级的长跑运动员，1983年世界锦标赛的1500米和3000米赛跑冠军，当她试图在1996年亚特兰大美国奥运选拔赛时复出时，她被指控违反了与睾酮使用一致的兴奋剂违规行为。经过各种审议，国际田联（自2001年起正式称为国际田径联合会）裁定斯莱尼“犯有兴奋剂违规行为”，实际上结束了她的职业生涯。根据斯莱尼案件的一些证词，她对尿检的假阳性率可能高达1%。这可能会让许多人感到安心，认为她有罪的可能性是99%，但正如我们所看到的，这并不正确。例如，假设有1000名运动员接受了检测，其中1/10是有罪的，当检测到有罪的运动员时，有50%的机会揭示兴奋剂违规行为。那么，对于每1000名接受检测的运动员，有100名是有罪的，检测会指向其中的50名。同时，对于那900名无辜的运动员，检测会指向其中的9名。所以，阳性兴奋剂检测真正意味着的不是她有罪的概率是99%，而是[50]/[59]
    = 84.7%。换句话说，你应该对斯莱尼有罪的证据有与掷骰子时1不会出现的概率一样多的信心。这当然留下了合理的怀疑空间，更重要的是，表明进行大规模检测（每年有90,000名运动员的尿液被检测）并基于这样的程序做出判断，意味着要谴责大量无辜的人。[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts9a)

    that happened, she was arrested and accused of smothering both children. At the

    Brown Simpson）和一名男性同伴的审判中辩护。辛普森是一位前足球明星，他的审判是1994-95年间最大的媒体事件之一。警方对他有大量证据。他们在他的庄园里找到了一只血迹斑斑的手套，似乎与犯罪现场找到的手套相匹配。手套上发现的血迹与妮可的血型相符，在辛普森的白色福特野马车上、他卧室的一双袜子以及他的车道和房子里都发现了与妮可血型相匹配的血迹。此外，从犯罪现场提取的血液样本与辛普森的DNA相匹配。辩护方几乎无法做更多的事情，只能指责洛杉矶警察局存在种族主义——辛普森是非洲裔美国人——并批评警察的诚信和证据的真实性。

    (1 in 2,500) but rather the probability that a battered wife who was murdered
    was murdered by her abuser. According to the Uniform Crime Reports for the United
    States and Its Possessions in 1993, the probability Dershowitz (or the prosecution)
    should have reported was this one: of all the battered women murdered in the United

    that allowed him to continue his groundbreaking work virtually undisturbed by
    the turbulent events transpiring around him. Prior to the French Revolution, Laplace
    obtained the lucrative post of examiner to the royal artillery, in which he had
    the luck to examine a promising sixteen-year-old candidate named Napoléon Bonaparte.
    When the revolution came, in 1789, he fell briefly under suspicion but unlike
    many others emerged unscathed, declaring his “inextinguishable hatred to royalty”
    and eventually winning new honors from the republic. Then, when his acquaintance
    Napoléon crowned himself emperor in 1804, he immediately shed his republicanism
    and in 1806 was given the title count. After the Bourbons returned, Laplace slammed
    Napoléon in the 1814 edition of his treatise *Théorie analytique des probabilités,*
    writing that “the fall of empires which aspired to universal dominion could be
    predicted with very high probability by one versed in the calculus of chance.”[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c06-nts17a)
