  zh: 概述
- en: In the beginning, there was the ENIAC Mark I. One day an operator happened to
    notice that the machine was malfunctioning and traced the problem to a moth that
    had flown into the machine and gotten beaten to death by the relay contacts.

  zh: 在最初，有ENIAC Mark I。有一天，一个操作员偶然注意到机器出现了故障，并追踪到一只飞进机器并被继电器接触打死的蛾子。
- en: 'She removed the moth, taped it in the log book, and made a notation: "Found
    a bug in the system." Thus, the first computer bug. ^([[1](#ftn.N23)])'

  zh: 她取出了蛾子，将其贴在日志簿中，并做了记录：“在系统中发现了一个错误。”因此，这是第一个计算机错误。^([[1](#ftn.N23)])
- en: My introduction to computer bugs came long after this. I wrote my first program
    at age 11\. It was one assembly language instruction long. The program added together
    2 + 2\. The result was 2\. The program was only one instruction long and it still
    had a bug in it.

  zh: 我对计算机错误的了解是在很久以后。我11岁时编写了我的第一个程序。这个程序只有一条汇编指令长。程序将2 + 2相加。结果是2。程序只有一条指令长，但它仍然有一个错误。
- en: 'This chapter contains a few "firsts": the first time I stayed up to 2:00 in
    the morning to locate a bug (Program 3), the first question on the first C programming
    test I administered (Program 2), and, of course, the first program in any programming
    book, "[Hello World](LiB0005.html#7)."'

- en: Before the days of ATMs you had to go to the bank and manually make a deposit.
    Usually you would use one of the preprinted deposit slips found in the back of
    your checkbook. These came with your account number written in magnetic ink on
    the bottom of the slip.

  zh: 在ATM出现之前，你必须去银行手动存款。通常你会使用你支票簿背面的预印存款纸条。这些纸条底部印有你的账号，用磁性油墨书写。
- en: If you ran out of slips, the bank would provide you with one. It had no number
    written at the bottom, so when it was processed using the bank's automatic machinery,
    so the machine kicked it out and a clerk manually entered the account number.

  zh: 如果你用完了纸条，银行会为你提供一张。这张纸条底部没有写上号码，所以当它被银行的自动机器处理时，机器就会将其踢出，然后由职员手动输入账号。
- en: A crook printed up his own version of the "generic" deposit slip. It looked
    like the normal "generic" deposit slip, except that the crook's account number
    was printed in magnetic ink at the bottom.

    slips.

- en: 'The scam worked this way: A customer entered the bank to make a deposit and
    got one of the doctored slips. He filled it out and made a deposit. Since the
    slip contains an account number, the computer automatically processed it and made
    a deposit into the account written on the bottom. Ignored was the handwritten
    account number on the slip. In other words, our crook was hijacking deposits.'

  zh: 这个骗局是这样进行的：一位客户进入银行存款，并得到了一张经过处理的纸条。他填写了它并进行了存款。由于纸条包含一个账号，计算机自动处理了它，并将存款存入底部写明的账户。手写的账号被忽略了。换句话说，我们的骗子正在劫持存款。
- en: A detective assigned to the case was baffled. Deposits were disappearing and
    no one knew how. He narrowed it down to deposits made in the bank. He decided
    to try and make a large number of deposits and see what would happen. Since he
    was using his own money, the deposits would have to be very small. Very very small.
    In fact they were for 6¢ each.

  zh: 被分配到这个案件的侦探感到困惑。存款正在消失，没有人知道原因。他将问题缩小到银行内的存款。他决定尝试进行大量存款，看看会发生什么。由于他使用的是自己的钱，存款必须非常小。非常非常小。实际上，每笔存款是6分。
- en: The detective spent a week making deposits. He would go to the bank, fill out
    a slip, get in line, make a deposit for 6¢, fill out a new slip, get in line,
    make a deposit for 6¢, and so on. The clerks thought he was crazy. One day, one
    of his deposits disappeared. So he had the bank search its records to see if anyone
    else had made a 6¢ deposit that day. Someone had, and the crook was caught.

  zh: 侦探花了一周时间存款。他会去银行，填写一张纸条，排队，存入6分的存款，填写一张新的纸条，排队，存入6分的存款，以此类推。职员们认为他疯了。有一天，他的一笔存款消失了。所以他让银行查阅其记录，看看那天是否有人存入了6分的存款。有人存了，骗子被抓住了。
