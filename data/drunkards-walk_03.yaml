- en: '**I**N THE YEARS leading up to 1576, an oddly attired old man could be found
    roving with a strange, irregular gait up and down the streets of Rome, shouting
    occasionally to no one in particular and being listened to by no one at all. He
    had once been celebrated throughout Europe, a famous astrologer, physician to
    nobles of the court, chair of medicine at the University of Pavia. He had created
    enduring inventions, including a forerunner of the combination lock and the universal
    joint, which is used in automobiles today. He had published 131 books on a wide
    range of topics in philosophy, medicine, mathematics, and science. In 1576, however,
    he was a man with a past but no future, living in obscurity and abject poverty.
    In the late summer of that year he sat at his desk and wrote his final words,
    an ode to his favorite son, his oldest, who had been executed sixteen years earlier,
    at age twenty-six. The old man died on September 20, a few days shy of his seventy-fifth
    birthday. He had outlived two of his three children; at his death his surviving
    son was employed by the Inquisition as a professional torturer. That plum job
    was a reward for having given evidence against his father.'

  zh: 在1576年之前的那几年里，一个穿着奇特的老人可以在罗马的街道上来回漫步，步态奇特，偶尔对着无人特定地喊叫，却没有人听他说话。他曾经在欧洲声名显赫，是一位著名的占星家，宫廷贵族的医生，帕维亚大学医学系的主任。他创造了许多持久的发明，包括组合锁的先驱和今天汽车上使用的万向节。他在哲学、医学、数学和科学等广泛的主题上出版了131本书。然而，到了1576年，他成了一个有过去但没有未来的人，生活在默默无闻和极端贫困中。那年夏天末，他坐在书桌前写下了他的最后几句话，这是一首赞美他最喜欢的儿子——他最年长的儿子，十六年前，也就是二十六岁时被处决——的颂歌。这位老人于9月20日去世，离他75岁生日还差几天。他比他的三个孩子中的两个活得久；他去世时，他的幸存儿子在宗教裁判所担任专业拷问官。这份美差是他因提供反对他父亲的证据而获得的奖励。

    Those sifting through his possessions found 111 that survived. One, written decades
    earlier and, from the looks of it, often revised, was a treatise of thirty-two
    short chapters. Titled *The Book on Games of Chance,* it was the first book ever
    written on the theory of randomness. People had been gambling and coping with
    other uncertainties for thousands of years. Can I make it across the desert before
    I die of thirst? Is it dangerous to remain under the cliff while the earth is
    shaking like this? Does that grin from the cave girl who likes to paint buffaloes
    on the sides of rocks mean she likes me? Yet until Cardano came along, no one
    had accomplished a reasoned analysis of the course that games or other uncertain
    processes take. Cardano’s insight into how chance works came embodied in a principle
    we shall call the law of the sample space. The law of the sample space represented
    a new idea and a new methodology and has formed the basis of the mathematical
    description of uncertainty in all the centuries that followed. It is a simple
    methodology, a laws-of-chance analog of the idea of balancing a checkbook. Yet
    with this simple method we gain the ability to approach many problems systematically
    that would otherwise prove almost hopelessly confusing. To illustrate both the
    use and the power of the law, we shall consider a problem that although easily
    stated and requiring no advanced mathematics to solve, has probably stumped more
    people than any other in the history of randomness.

    sixteenth-century Europe. To Cardano a dog’s howl portended the death of a loved
    one, and a few ravens croaking on the roof meant a grave illness was on its way.
    He believed as much as anyone else in fate, in luck, and in seeing your future
    in the alignment of planets and stars. Still, had he played poker, he wouldn’t
    have been found drawing to an inside straight. For Cardano, gambling was second
    nature. His feeling for it was seated in his gut, not in his head, and so his
    understanding of the mathematical relationships among a game’s possible random
    outcomes transcended his belief that owing to fate, any such insight is futile.
    Cardano’s work also transcended the primitive state of mathematics in his day,
    for algebra and even arithmetic were yet in their stone age in the early sixteenth
    century, preceding even the invention of the equal sign.

    have put your money on. His mother, Chiara, despised children, though—or perhaps
    *because*—she already had three boys. Short, stout, hot tempered, and promiscuous,
    she prepared a kind of sixteenth-century morning-after pill when she became pregnant
    with Gerolamo—a brew of wormwood, burned barleycorn, and tamarisk root. She drank
    it down in an attempt to abort the fetus. The brew sickened her, but the unborn

    Cardano不是一个你会下注的孩子。他的母亲Chiara讨厌孩子，尽管——或者可能正因为——她已经有三个儿子。她身材矮小，体态丰满，脾气暴躁，放荡不羁，当她怀上Gerolamo时，她准备了一种十六世纪的紧急避孕药——一种由苦艾、烧焦的大麦和柳树根制成的混合物。她喝下这种混合物，试图堕胎。这种混合物让她感到恶心，但未出生的Gerolamo对此毫不在意，他对混合物在母亲血液中留下的任何代谢物都感到心满意足。她的其他尝试都以类似的失败告终。
- en: 'Chiara and Gerolamo’s father, Fazio Cardano, were not married, but they often
    acted as if they were—they were known for their many loud quarrels. A month before
    Gerolamo’s birth, Chiara left their home in Milan to live with her sister in Pavia,
    twenty miles to the south. Gerolamo emerged after three days of painful labor.
    One look at the infant and Chiara must have thought she would be rid of him after
    all. He was frail, and worse, lay silent. Chiara’s midwife predicted he’d be dead
    within the hour. But if Chiara was thinking, *good riddance,* she was let down
    again, for the baby’s wet nurse soaked him in a bath of warm wine, and Gerolamo
    revived. The infant’s good health lasted only a few months, however. Then he,
    his nurse, and his three half brothers all came down with the plague. The Black
    Death, as the plague is sometimes called, is really three distinct diseases: bubonic,
    pneumonic, and septicemic plague. Cardano contracted bubonic, the most common,
    named for the buboes, the painful egg-size swellings of the lymph nodes that are
    one of the disease’s prominent symptoms. Life expectancy, once buboes appeared,

    reached the age of five, his father brought him into the business—in a manner
    of speaking. That is, he strapped a pannier to his son’s back, stuffed it with
    heavy legal and medical books, and began dragging the young boy to meetings with
    his patrons all over town. Gerolamo would later write that “from time to time
    as we walked the streets my father would command me to stop while he opened a

    yet in those games he did have an advantage, because he had developed a better
    understanding of the odds of winning in various situations than any of his opponents.
    And so for his entrée into the betting world, Cardano played the games of pure
    chance. Before long he had set aside over 1,000 crowns for his education—more

    had been Greek to the Greeks, and to the Romans, for the Hindus had taken the
    first large steps toward employing arithmetic as a powerful tool. It was in that
    milieu that positional notation in base ten developed, and became standard, around
    A.D. 700.[^(11)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts11a) The Hindus also
    made great progress in the arithmetic of fractions—something crucial to the analysis
    of probabilities, since the chances of something occurring are always less than
    one. This Hindu knowledge was picked up by the Arabs and eventually brought to
    Europe. There the first abbreviations, *p* for “plus” and *m* for “minus,” were
    used in the fifteenth century. The symbols + and - were introduced around the
    same time by the Germans, but only to indicate excess and deficient weights of
    chests. It gives one a feeling for some of the challenges Cardano faced to note
    that the equal sign did not yet exist, to be invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde
    of Oxford and Cambridge, who, inspired by geometry, remarked that no things could
    be more nearly alike than parallel lines and hence decided that such lines should
    denote equality. And the symbol ×, for multiplication, attributable to an Anglican
    minister, didn’t arrive on the scene until the seventeenth century.

    proportion of outcomes that are favorable. The set of all possible outcomes is

- en: One of the greatest deficiencies of Cardano’s work was that he made no systematic
    analysis of the different ways in which a series of events, such as coin tosses,
    can turn out. As we shall see in the next chapter, no one did that until the following
    century. Still, a series of two coin tosses is simple enough that Cardano’s methods
    are easily applied. The key is to realize that the possible outcomes of coin flipping
    are the data describing how the two coins land, not the total number of heads
    calculated *from* that data, as in Alembert’s analysis. In other words, we should
    not consider 0, 1, or 2 heads as the possible outcomes but rather the sequences

  zh: Cardano工作的最大缺陷之一是他没有对一系列事件，如抛硬币，可能出现的不同方式做出系统分析。正如我们将在下一章中看到的，直到下一个世纪，没有人这样做。然而，连续抛两次硬币的过程足够简单，以至于Cardano的方法可以很容易地应用。关键是意识到抛硬币的可能结果描述的是两枚硬币落地的序列，而不是从这些数据中计算出的总头数，就像在Alembert的分析中那样。换句话说，我们不应该将0、1或2个头视为可能的结果，而应该将序列（正面，正面）、（正面，反面）、（反面，正面）和（反面，反面）视为可能的结果。这些是构成样本空间的4种可能性。
- en: 'The next step, according to Cardano, is to sort through the outcomes, cataloguing
    the number of heads we can harvest from each. Only 1 of the 4 outcomes—(heads,
    heads)—yields 2 heads. Similarly, only (tails, tails) yields 0 heads. But if we
    desire 1 head, then *2* of the outcomes are favorable: (heads, tails) and (tails,
    heads). And so Cardano’s method shows that Alembert was wrong: the chances are
    25 percent for 0 or 2 heads but 50 percent for 1 head. Had Cardano laid his cash
    on 1 head at 3 to 1, he would have lost only half the time but tripled his money

    valuable, say a shiny red Maserati; behind the other two, an item of far less
    interest, say the complete works of Shakespeare in Serbian. You have chosen door

- en: Now according to the problem, the next thing that happens is that the host,
    who knows what’s behind all the doors, opens one you did not choose, revealing
    one of the sets of Shakespeare. In opening this door, the host has used what he
    knows to avoid revealing the Maserati, so this is *not* a completely random process.
    There are two cases to consider.

  zh: 现在根据问题，接下来发生的事情是，主持人，他知道所有门后面是什么，打开了一扇你没有选择的门，揭示了一组莎士比亚的作品。在打开这扇门时，主持人已经利用他所知道的信息来避免揭示玛莎拉蒂，所以这并不是一个完全随机的过程。有几种情况需要考虑。
- en: One is the case in which your initial choice was correct. Let’s call that the
    Lucky Guess scenario. The host will now randomly open door 2 or door 3, and, if
    you choose to switch, instead of enjoying a fast, sexy ride, you’ll be the owner
    of *Troilus and Cressida* in the Torlakian dialect. In the Lucky Guess scenario
    you are better off not switching—but the probability of landing in the Lucky Guess
    scenario is only 1 in 3.

  zh: 一种是你的初始选择是正确的。我们可以称之为幸运猜测场景。现在主持人将随机打开门2或门3，如果你选择换门，你将不会享受到快速、性感的驾驶，而是将拥有托尔克尼亚方言中的《特洛伊罗斯与克瑞西达》。在幸运猜测场景中，你最好不要换门——但落在幸运猜测场景的概率只有1/3。
- en: 'The other case we must consider is that in which your initial choice was wrong.
    We’ll call that the Wrong Guess scenario. The chances you guessed wrong are 2
    out of 3, so the Wrong Guess scenario is twice as likely to occur as the Lucky
    Guess scenario. How does the Wrong Guess scenario differ from the Lucky Guess
    scenario? In the Wrong Guess scenario the Maserati is behind one of the doors
    you did not choose, and a copy of the Serbian Shakespeare is behind the other
    unchosen door. Unlike the Lucky Guess scenario, in this scenario the host does
    not randomly open an unchosen door. Since he does not want to reveal the Maserati,
    he *chooses* to open precisely the door that does *not* have the Maserati behind
    it. In other words, in the Wrong Guess scenario the host intervenes in what until
    now has been a random process. So the process is no longer random: the host uses
    his knowledge to bias the result, violating randomness by *guaranteeing* that
    if you switch your choice, you will get the fancy red car. Because of this intervention,
    if you find yourself in the Wrong Guess scenario, you will win if you switch and
    lose if you don’t.'

  zh: 我们必须考虑的另一种情况是，你的初始选择是错误的。我们可以称之为错误猜测场景。你猜错的概率是2/3，所以错误猜测场景发生的可能性是幸运猜测场景的两倍。错误猜测场景与幸运猜测场景有什么不同？在错误猜测场景中，玛莎拉蒂在你不选择的那扇门后面，而塞尔维亚语的莎士比亚全集在另一扇未选择的门后面。与幸运猜测场景不同，在这个场景中，主持人不会随机打开一扇未选择的门。由于他不想揭示玛莎拉蒂，他会“选择”打开恰好没有玛莎拉蒂的那扇门。换句话说，在错误猜测场景中，主持人干预了之前一直是随机的过程。因此，这个过程不再是随机的：主持人利用他的知识来偏袒结果，通过“保证”如果你换选择，你将得到那辆豪华的红色汽车来违反随机性。由于这种干预，如果你发现自己处于错误猜测场景中，你换选择就会赢，不换选择就会输。
- en: 'To summarize: if you are in the Lucky Guess scenario (probability 1 in 3),
    you’ll win if you stick with your choice. If you are in the Wrong Guess scenario
    (probability 2 in 3), owing to the actions of the host, you will win if you switch
    your choice. And so your decision comes down to a guess: in which scenario do
    you find yourself? If you feel that ESP or fate has guided your initial choice,
    maybe you shouldn’t switch. But unless you can bend silver spoons into pretzels
    with your brain waves, the odds are 2 to 1 that you are in the Wrong Guess scenario,
    and so it is better to switch. Statistics from the television program bear this
    out: those who found themselves in the situation described in the problem and
    switched their choice won about twice as often as those who did not.'

  zh: 总结来说：如果你处于幸运猜测场景（概率为1/3），坚持你的选择就能赢得比赛。如果你处于错误猜测场景（概率为2/3），由于主持人的行为，如果你改变选择，你将赢得比赛。因此，你的决定归结为一个猜测：你处于哪种场景？如果你觉得ESP或命运引导了你的初始选择，那么你可能不应该改变选择。但除非你能用你的脑波将银勺弯曲成椒盐卷饼，否则你处于错误猜测场景的概率是2比1，因此最好改变选择。电视节目的统计数据证实了这一点：那些发现自己处于问题中描述的情况并改变选择的人，赢得比赛的概率大约是没有改变选择的人的两倍。
- en: The Monty Hall problem is hard to grasp because unless you think about it carefully,
    the role of the host, like that of your mother, goes unappreciated. But the host
    is fixing the game. The host’s role can be made obvious if we suppose that instead
    of 3 doors, there were 100\. You still choose door 1, but now you have a probability
    of 1 in 100 of being right. Meanwhile the chance of the Maserati’s being behind
    one of the other doors is 99 in 100\. As before, the host opens all but one of
    the doors that you did not pick, being sure not to open the door hiding the Maserati
    if it is one of them. After he is done, the chances are still 1 in 100 that the
    Maserati was behind the door you chose and still 99 in 100 that it was behind
    one of the other doors. But now, thanks to the intervention of the host, there
    is only one door left representing all 99 of those other doors, and so the probability
    that the Maserati is behind that remaining door is 99 out of 100!

  zh: 摩纳哥大厅问题难以理解，因为除非你仔细思考，否则主持人的角色，就像你母亲的角色一样，没有得到应有的重视。但主持人是在操纵游戏。如果我们假设不是3扇门，而是100扇门，那么主持人的角色就会变得明显。你仍然选择第1扇门，但现在你有1/100的正确概率。同时，玛莎拉蒂被藏在其他门后的概率是99/100。就像之前一样，主持人会打开你未选择的除一扇门外的所有门，确保不会打开藏有玛莎拉蒂的那扇门。在他完成之后，玛莎拉蒂在你选择的门后的概率仍然是1/100，而在其他门后的概率仍然是99/100。但现在，由于主持人的干预，只剩下了一扇门代表所有那99扇门，因此玛莎拉蒂在那扇剩余的门后的概率是99/100！
- en: Had the Monty Hall problem been around in Cardano’s day, would he have been
    a Marilyn vos Savant or a Paul Erdös? The law of the sample space handles the
    problem nicely, but we have no way of knowing for sure, for the earliest known
    statement of the problem (under a different name) didn’t occur until 1959, in
    an article by Martin Gardner in *Scientific American.*[^(16)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts16a)
    Gardner called it “a wonderfully confusing little problem” and noted that “in
    no other branch of mathematics is it so easy for experts to blunder as in probability
    theory.” Of course, to a mathematician a blunder is an issue of embarrassment,
    but to a gambler it is an issue of livelihood. And so it is fitting that when
    it came to the first systematic theory of probability, it took Cardano, the gambler,
    to figure things out.

  zh: 如果蒙提霍尔问题在卡尔达诺的时代就存在，他会成为玛丽莲·沃斯·萨凡特还是保罗·埃尔德什？样本空间定律很好地解决了这个问题，但我们无法确定，因为关于这个问题的最早已知陈述（以不同的名称）直到1959年才出现，在马丁·加德纳的《科学美国人》杂志文章中。加德纳称其为“一个令人困惑的小问题”，并指出“在数学的任何其他分支中，专家犯错误都如此容易，就像在概率论中一样。”当然，对于一个数学家来说，错误是一个令人尴尬的问题，但对于一个赌徒来说，它是一个生计问题。因此，当涉及到概率论的第一套系统理论时，正是赌徒卡尔达诺解决了这个问题。

    a few months, Cardano noticed, his friend’s name was no longer mentioned by anyone.
    This saddened him and left a deep impression. How does one overcome the fact that
    life is transitory? He decided that the only way was to leave something behind—heirs
    or lasting works of some kind or both. In his autobiography, Cardano describes
    developing “an unshakable ambition” to leave his mark on the world.[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts17a)

    While in college he had written a paper, “On the Differing Opinions of Physicians,”
    that essentially called the medical establishment a bunch of quacks. The Milan
    College of Physicians now returned the favor, refusing to admit him. That meant
    he could not practice in Milan. And so, using money he had saved from his tutoring
    and gambling, Cardano bought a tiny house to the east, in the town of Piove di
    Sacco. He expected to do good business there because disease was rife in the town
    and it had no physician. But his market research had a fatal flaw: the town had
    no doctor because the populace preferred to be treated by sorcerers and priests.
    After years of intense work and study, Cardano found himself with little income
    but a lot of spare time on his hands. It proved a lucky break, for he seized the
    opportunity and began to write books. One of them was *The Book on Games of Chance.*'

  zh: 在获得医学学位后，卡丹多回到了米兰，寻找工作。在大学期间，他写了一篇论文《论医生的不同意见》，实际上是在批评医学界是一群江湖郎中。米兰医学院现在回报了他的好意，拒绝了他的入学申请。这意味着他不能在米兰行医。因此，利用他从家教和赌博中节省下来的钱，卡丹多在皮奥韦迪萨科镇买了一座小房子。他预计在那里能做很好的生意，因为镇上疾病流行，而且没有医生。但他的市场调研有一个致命的缺陷：镇上没有医生，因为居民们更愿意由巫师和牧师来治疗。经过多年的辛勤工作和学习，卡丹多发现自己手头上有许多空闲时间，但收入很少。这证明是一个幸运的转折，因为他抓住了这个机会，开始写书。其中之一就是《论机会游戏》。
- en: In 1532, after five years in Sacco, Cardano moved back to Milan, hoping to have
    his work published and once again applying for membership in the College of Physicians.
    On both fronts he was roundly rejected. “In those days,” he wrote, “I was sickened
    so to the heart that I would visit diviners and wizards so that some solution
    might be found to my manifold troubles.”[^(18)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts18a)
    One wizard suggested he shield himself from moon rays. Another that, on waking,
    he sneeze three times and knock on wood. Cardano followed all their prescriptions,
    but none changed his bad fortune. And so, hooded, he took to sneaking from building
    to building at night, surreptitiously treating patients who either couldn’t afford
    the fees of sanctioned doctors or else didn’t improve in their care. To supplement
    the income he earned from that endeavor, he wrote in his autobiography, he was
    “forced to the dice again so that I could support my wife; and here my knowledge
    defeated fortune, and we were able to buy food and live, though our lodgings were
    desolate.”[^(19)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts19a) As for *The Book
    on Games of Chance,* though he would revise and improve the manuscript repeatedly
    in the years to come, he never again sought to have it published, perhaps because
    he realized it wasn’t a good idea to teach anyone to gamble as well as he could.

  zh: 1532年，在萨科待了五年后，卡丹多回到了米兰，希望自己的作品能被出版，并再次申请加入医学院。在两方面他都遭到了彻底的拒绝。“在那个时代，”他写道，“我内心感到如此恶心，以至于我会去拜访占卜者和巫师，希望找到解决我众多麻烦的方法。”

- en: Cardano eventually achieved his goals in life, obtaining both heirs and fame—and
    a good deal of fortune to boot. The fortune began to accrue when he published
    a book based on his old college paper, altering the title from the somewhat academic
    “On the Differing Opinions of Physicians” to the zinger *On the Bad Practice of
    Medicine in Common Use.* The book was a hit. And then, when one of his secret
    patients, a well-known prior of the Augustinian order of friars, suddenly (and
    in all likelihood by chance) improved and attributed his recovery to Cardano’s
    care, Cardano’s fame as a physician took off on an upward spiral that reached
    such heights the College of Physicians felt compelled not only to grant him membership
    but also to make him its rector. Meanwhile he was publishing more books, and they
    did well, especially one for the general public called *The Practice of Arithmetic.*
    A few years later he published a more technical book, called the *Ars magna,*
    or *The Great Art,* a treatise on algebra in which he gave the first clear picture
    of negative numbers and a famous analysis of certain algebraic equations. When
    he reached his early fifties, in the mid-1550s, Cardano was at his peak, chairman
    of medicine at the University of Pavia and a wealthy man.

  zh: 卡尔达诺最终实现了他的人生目标，获得了继承权、名声——以及相当可观的财富。他的财富开始积累，当他出版了一本基于他大学旧论文的书时，将标题从有些学术性的“关于医生的不同意见”改为更尖锐的《常见医学的恶劣实践》。这本书大受欢迎。然后，当他的一个秘密病人，一位著名的奥古斯丁会修士的前任，突然（很可能纯属偶然）康复，并将他的康复归功于卡尔达诺的照顾时，卡尔达诺作为医生的声誉开始急剧上升，达到了如此的高度，以至于医学院不仅被迫授予他会员资格，还任命他为院长。与此同时，他还在出版更多的书籍，而且它们都取得了成功，尤其是为大众所著的《算术实践》。几年后，他出版了一本更技术性的书籍，名为《大术》或《大艺术》，这是一本关于代数的论文，他在其中给出了负数的第一个清晰图景，并对某些代数方程进行了著名的分析。当他到了五十年代初，即1550年代中期，卡尔达诺正处于巅峰，是帕维亚大学医学系的主席，并且是一个富有的人。
- en: His good fortune didn’t last. To a large extent what brought Cardano down was
    the other part of his legacy—his children. When she was sixteen, his daughter
    Chiara (named after his mother) seduced his older son, Giovanni, and become pregnant.
    She had a successful abortion, but it left her infertile. That suited her just
    fine, for she was boldly promiscuous, even after her marriage, and contracted
    syphilis. Giovanni went on to become a doctor but was soon more famous as a petty
    criminal, so famous he was blackmailed into marriage by a family of gold diggers
    who had proof that he had murdered, by poison, a minor city official. Meanwhile
    Aldo, Cardano’s younger son who as a child had engaged in the torture of animals,
    turned that passion into work as a freelance torturer for the Inquisition. And
    like Giovanni, he moonlighted as a crook.

  zh: 他的好运并没有持续太久。在很大程度上，导致卡尔达诺衰落的是他的另一部分遗产——他的孩子们。当他16岁时，他的女儿奇亚拉（以他的母亲命名）诱惑了他的大儿子乔瓦尼，并怀孕了。她成功地进行了堕胎，但这使她失去了生育能力。这对她来说正好合适，因为她大胆地滥交，甚至在婚后也是如此，并感染了梅毒。乔瓦尼后来成为了一名医生，但很快因小偷小摸而闻名，以至于一个以敲诈勒索为生的家庭通过证据证明他毒杀了一个小城市官员，迫使他结婚。与此同时，阿尔多，卡尔达诺的小儿子，小时候曾参与虐待动物，将这种热情转化为为宗教裁判所工作的自由职业折磨者。而且像乔瓦尼一样，他业余时间也做坏事。
- en: A few years after his marriage Giovanni gave one of his servants a mysterious
    mixture to incorporate into a cake for Giovanni’s wife. When she keeled over after
    enjoying her dessert, the authorities put two and two together. Despite Gerolamo’s
    spending a fortune on lawyers, his attempts to pull strings, and his testimony
    on his son’s behalf, young Giovanni was executed in prison a short while later.
    The drain on Cardano’s funds and reputation made him vulnerable to his old enemies.
    The senate in Milan expunged his name from the list of those allowed to lecture,
    and accusing him of sodomy and incest, had him exiled from the province. When
    Cardano left Milan at the end of 1563, he wrote in his autobiography, he was “reduced
    once more to rags, my fortune gone, my income ceased, my rents withheld, my books
    impounded.”[^(20)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c03-nts20a) By that time
    his mind was going too, and he was given to periods of incoherence. As the final
    blow, a self-taught mathematician named Niccolò Tartaglia, angry because in *Ars
    magna* Cardano had revealed Tartaglia’s secret method of solving certain equations,
    coaxed Aldo into giving evidence against his father in exchange for an official
    appointment as public torturer and executioner for the city of Bologna. Cardano
    was jailed briefly, then quietly lived out his last few years in Rome. *The Book
    on Games of Chance* was finally published in 1663, over 100 years after young
    Cardano had first put the words to paper. By then his methods of analysis had
    been reproduced and surpassed.
