    dancing randomly above the white paraffin cylinders that fueled them. I was too
    young to think candlelight romantic, but still I found it magical—because of the
    flickering images created by the fire. They shifted and morphed, grew and waned,
    all without apparent cause or plan. Surely, I believed, there must be rhyme and
    reason underlying the flame, some pattern that scientists could predict and explain
    with their mathematical equations. “Life isn’t like that,” my father told me.
    “Sometimes things happen that cannot be foreseen.” He told me of the time when,
    in Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp in which he was imprisoned and starving,
    he stole a loaf of bread from the bakery. The baker had the Gestapo gather everyone
    who might have committed the crime and line the suspects up. “Who stole the bread?”
    the baker asked. When no one answered, he told the guards to shoot the suspects
    one by one until either they were all dead or someone confessed. My father stepped
    forward to spare the others. He did not try to paint himself in a heroic light
    but told me that he did it because he expected to be shot either way. Instead
    of having him killed, though, the baker gave my father a plum job, as his assistant.
    “A chance event,” my father said. “It had nothing to do with you, but had it happened
    differently, you would never have been born.” It struck me then that I have Hitler
    to thank for my existence, for the Germans had killed my father’s wife and two
    young children, erasing his prior life. And so were it not for the war, my father
    would never have emigrated to New York, never have met my mother, also a refugee,
    and never have produced me and my two brothers.'

    in our lives is not predicated on extremes. The outline of our lives, like the
    candle’s flame, is continuously coaxed in new directions by a variety of random
    events that, along with our responses to them, determine our fate. As a result,
    life is both hard to predict and hard to interpret. Just as, looking at a Rorschach
    blot, you might see Madonna and I, a duck-billed platypus, the data we encounter

- en: 'We often employ intuitive processes when we make assessments and choices in
    uncertain situations. Those processes no doubt carried an evolutionary advantage
    when we had to decide whether a saber-toothed tiger was smiling because it was
    fat and happy or because it was famished and saw us as its next meal. But the
    modern world has a different balance, and today those intuitive processes come
    with drawbacks. When we use our habitual ways of thinking to deal with today’s
    tigers, we can be led to decisions that are less than optimal or even incongruous.
    That conclusion comes as no surprise to those who study how the brain processes
    uncertainty: many studies point to a close connection between the parts of our
    brain that make assessments of chance situations and those that handle the human
    characteristic that is often considered our prime source of irrationality—our
    emotions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, for example, shows that risk
    and reward are assessed by parts of the dopaminergic system, a brain-reward circuit
    important for motivational and emotional processes.[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts1a)

    product of evolutionary factors, brain structure, personal experience, knowledge,
    and emotion. In fact, the human response to uncertainty is so complex that sometimes
    different structures within the brain come to different conclusions and apparently
    fight it out to determine which one will dominate. For example, if your face swells
    to five times its normal size three out of every four times you eat shrimp, the
    “logical” left hemisphere of your brain will attempt to find a pattern. The “intuitive”
    right hemisphere of your brain, on the other hand, will simply say “avoid shrimp.”
    At least that’s what researchers found in less painful experimental setups. The
    game is called probability guessing. In lieu of toying with shrimp and histamine,
    subjects are shown a series of cards or lights, which can have two colors, say
    green and red. Things are arranged so that the colors will appear with different
    probabilities but otherwise without a pattern. For example, red might appear twice
    as often as green in a sequence like red-red-green-red-green-red-red-green-green-red-red-red,
    and so on. The task of the subject, after watching for a while, is to predict
    whether each new member of the sequence will be red or green.

    notice occurs more frequently. That is the route favored by rats and other nonhuman
    animals. If you employ this strategy, you are guaranteed a certain degree of success

    shows up 75 percent of the time and you decide to always guess green, you will
    be correct 75 percent of the time. The other strategy is to “match” your proportion
    of green and red guesses to the proportion of green and red you observed in the
    past. If the greens and reds appear in a pattern and you can figure out the pattern,
    this strategy enables you to guess right every time. But if the colors appear
    at random, you would be better off sticking with the first strategy. In the case
    where green randomly appears 75 percent of the time, the second strategy will

    a rather unexciting chore: lecturing to a group of Israeli air force flight instructors
    on the conventional wisdom of behavior modification and its application to the

- en: 'How can that be? The answer lies in a phenomenon called regression toward the
    mean. That is, in any series of random events an extraordinary event is most likely
    to be followed, due purely to chance, by a more ordinary one. Here is how it works:
    The student pilots all had a certain personal ability to fly fighter planes. Raising
    their skill level involved many factors and required extensive practice, so although
    their skill was slowly improving through flight training, the change wouldn’t
    be noticeable from one maneuver to the next. Any especially good or especially
    poor performance was thus mostly a matter of luck. So if a pilot made an exceptionally
    good landing—one far above his normal level of performance—then the odds would
    be good that he would perform closer to his norm—that is, worse—the next day.
    And if his instructor had praised him, it would appear that the praise had done
    no good. But if a pilot made an exceptionally bad landing—running the plane off
    the end of the runway and into the vat of corn chowder in the base cafeteria—then
    the odds would be good that the next day he would perform closer to his norm—that
    is, better. And if his instructor had a habit of screaming “you clumsy ape” when
    a student performed poorly, it would appear that his criticism did some good.
    In this way an *apparent* pattern would emerge: student performs well, praise
    does no good; student performs poorly, instructor compares student to lower primate
    at high volume, student improves. The instructors in Kahneman’s class had concluded
    from such experiences that their screaming was a powerful educational tool. In
    reality it made no difference at all.'

    universal? Do we, like the flight instructors, believe that harsh criticism improves
    our children’s behavior or our employees’ performance? Do we make other misjudgments

    certain strategies to reduce the complexity of tasks of judgment and that intuition
    about probabilities plays an important part in that process. Will you feel sick

    the number of times you’ve spent the following night guzzling Pepto-Bismol, and
    come up with a numerical estimate. You let your intuition do the work. But research
    in the 1950s and early ’60s indicated that people’s intuition about randomness
    fails them in such situations. How widespread, Kahneman wondered, was this misunderstanding
    of uncertainty? And what are its implications for human decision making? A few
    years passed, and Kahneman invited a fellow junior professor, Amos Tversky, to
    give a guest lecture at one of his seminars. Later, at lunch, Kahneman mentioned
    his developing ideas to Tversky. Over the next thirty years, Tversky and Kahneman
    found that even among sophisticated subjects, when it came to random processes—whether
    in military or sports situations, business quandaries, or medical questions—people’s
    beliefs and intuition very often let them down.

    than the works of John Grisham, Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), and J. K. Rowling.
    Yet the manuscripts they wrote before they became famous—all eventually hugely
    successful—were all repeatedly rejected. John Grisham’s manuscript for *A Time
    to Kill* was rejected by twenty-six publishers; his second manuscript, for *The
    Firm,* drew interest from publishers only after a bootleg copy circulating in
    Hollywood drew a $600,000 offer for the movie rights. Dr. Seuss’s first children’s
    book, *And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,* was rejected by twenty-seven
    publishers. And J. K. Rowling’s first *Harry Potter* manuscript was rejected by
    nine.[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts8a) Then there is the other
    side of the coin—the side anyone in the business knows all too well: the many
    authors who had great potential but never made it, John Grishams who quit after
    the first twenty rejections or J. K. Rowlings who gave up after the first five.
    After his many rejections, one such writer, John Kennedy Toole, lost hope of ever
    getting his novel published and committed suicide. His mother persevered, however,
    and eleven years later *A Confederacy of Dunces* was published; it won the Pulitzer
    Prize for Fiction and has sold nearly 2 million copies.'

- en: MY OWN EPIPHANY regarding the hidden effects of randomness came in college,
    when I took a course in probability and began applying its principles to the sports
    world. That is easy to do because, as in the film business, most accomplishments
    in sports are easily quantified and the data are readily available. What I discovered
    was that just as the lessons of persistence, practice, and teamwork that we learn
    from sports apply equally to all endeavors of life, so do the lessons of randomness.
    And so I set out to examine a tale of two baseball sluggers, Roger Maris and Mickey
    Mantle, a tale that bears a lesson for all of us, even those who wouldn’t know
    a baseball from a Ping-Pong ball.

  zh: 我自己对随机性的隐藏效应的顿悟是在大学期间产生的，当时我选修了一门概率论课程，并开始将它的原理应用于体育世界。这样做很容易，因为就像电影行业一样，体育领域的成就很容易量化，数据也容易获取。我发现，正如我们从体育中学到的坚持不懈、练习和团队合作的教训同样适用于生活的所有事业一样，随机性的教训也是如此。因此，我开始考察两位棒球强打者罗杰·马里斯和米基·曼特尔的传奇故事，这个故事对我们所有人都有启示，即使是对棒球一无所知的人也是如此。
- en: The year was 1961\. I was barely of reading age, but I still recall the faces
    of Maris and his more popular New York Yankees teammate, Mantle, on the cover
    of *Life* magazine. The two baseball players were engaged in a historic race to
    tie or break Babe Ruth’s beloved 1927 record of 60 home runs in one year. Those
    were idealistic times when my teacher would say things like “we need more heroes
    like Babe Ruth,” or “we never had a crooked president.” Because the legend of
    Babe Ruth was sacred, anyone who might challenge it had better be worthy. Mantle,
    a courageous perennial slugger who fought on despite bad knees, was the fans’—and
    the press’s—overwhelming favorite. A good-looking, good-natured fellow, Mantle
    came across as the kind of all-American boy everyone hoped would set records.
    Maris, on the other hand, was a gruff, private fellow, an underdog who had never
    hit more than 39 home runs in a year, much less anywhere near 60\. He was seen
    as a nasty sort, someone who didn’t give interviews and didn’t like kids. They
    all rooted for Mantle. I liked Maris.

  zh: 那一年是1961年。我几乎还没有到阅读的年龄，但我仍然记得马里斯和他的更受欢迎的纽约洋基队友曼特尔在《生活》杂志封面的面孔。这两位棒球运动员正在进行一场历史性的比赛，以平或打破贝比·鲁斯1927年创下的60个本垒打一年的记录。那是一个理想主义的时代，我的老师会说些像“我们需要更多像贝比·鲁斯这样的英雄”或“我们从未有过一个不正直的总统”这样的话。因为贝比·鲁斯的传说神圣不可侵犯，任何可能挑战它的人都必须是值得的。曼特尔是一个勇敢的常年强打者，尽管膝盖不好，但他仍然在战斗，他是球迷和媒体的压倒性首选。曼特尔是一个英俊、性格温和的家伙，给人一种典型的美国男孩的感觉，每个人都希望他会打破记录。另一方面，马里斯是一个粗鲁、内向的人，一个从未在一年中打出超过39个本垒打，更不用说接近60个本垒打的劣势者。他被看作是一个讨厌的家伙，不喜欢接受采访，也不喜欢孩子。他们都为曼特尔加油。我喜欢马里斯。
- en: 'As it turned out, Mantle’s knees got the best of him, and he made it to only
    54 home runs. Maris broke Ruth’s record with 61\. Over his career, Babe Ruth had
    hit 50 or more home runs in a season four times and twelve times had hit more
    than anyone else in the league. Maris never again hit 50 or even 40 and never
    again led the league. That overall performance fed the resentment. As the years
    went by, Maris was criticized relentlessly by fans, sportswriters, and sometimes
    other players. Their verdict: he had crumbled under the pressure of being a champion.
    Said one famous baseball old-timer, “Maris had no right to break Ruth’s record.”[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts17a)

  zh: 结果证明，曼特尔的膝盖打败了他，他只打出了54个本垒打。马里斯打破了鲁斯的记录，打出了61个。在其整个职业生涯中，贝比·鲁斯在赛季中打出50个或更多的本垒打有四次，十二次打出比联盟中任何人都多的本垒打。马里斯再也没有打出50个或40个本垒打，再也没有领导过联盟。这种整体表现激起了怨恨。随着时间的推移，马里斯被球迷、体育记者和有时其他球员无情地批评。他们的结论是，他在冠军的压力下崩溃了。一位著名的棒球老将说：“马里斯没有打破鲁斯记录的资格。”[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts17a)这可能是对的，但不是老将们认为的那个原因。
- en: 'Many years later, influenced by that college math course, I would learn to
    think about Maris’s achievement in a new light. To analyze the Ruth-Mantle race
    I reread that old *Life* article and found in it a brief discussion of probability
    theory[^(18)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts18a) and how it could
    be used to predict the result of the Maris-Mantle race. I decided to make my own
    mathematical model of home run hitting. Here’s how it goes: The result of any
    particular at bat (that is, an opportunity for success) depends primarily on the
    player’s ability, of course. But it also depends on the interplay of many other
    factors: his health; the wind, the sun, or the stadium lights; the quality of
    the pitches he receives; the game situation; whether he correctly guesses how
    the pitcher will throw; whether his hand-eye coordination works just perfectly
    as he takes his swing; whether that brunette he met at the bar kept him up too
    late or the chili-cheese dog with garlic fries he had for breakfast soured his
    stomach. If not for all the unpredictable factors, a player would either hit a
    home run on every at bat or fail to do so. Instead, for each at bat all you can
    say is that he has a certain probability of hitting a home run and a certain probability
    of failing to hit one. Over the hundreds of at bats he has each year, those random
    factors usually average out and result in some typical home run production that
    increases as the player becomes more skillful and then eventually decreases owing
    to the same process that etches wrinkles in his handsome face. But sometimes the
    random factors don’t average out. How often does that happen, and how large is
    the aberration?'

  zh: 多年后，受那门大学数学课程的影响，我开始以新的视角思考马里斯的成就。为了分析鲁斯-曼特尔比赛，我重新阅读了那篇旧的《生活》杂志文章，并在其中找到了关于概率理论的简要讨论[^(18)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts18a)以及它是如何被用来预测马里斯-曼特尔比赛结果的。我决定创建自己关于全垒打击打的数学模型。下面是如何进行的：任何特定击球的成果（即成功的机会）主要取决于球员的能力，当然。但它也取决于许多其他因素的相互作用：他的健康状况；风、阳光或体育场灯光；他接到的投球质量；比赛情况；他是否正确猜测了投手的投球方式；当他挥棒时，他的手眼协调是否完美无缺；他是否因为酒吧遇到的那个金发女郎让他熬夜太晚，或者他早餐吃的加了蒜味的辣味热狗让他胃部不适。如果不是因为所有不可预测的因素，球员要么在每次击球时都能击出全垒打，要么一次也击不中。相反，对于每次击球，你只能说球员有一定概率击出全垒打，也有一定概率未能击出。在每年数百次的击球中，这些随机因素通常平均化，并导致一些典型的全垒打产量，随着球员技术的提高而增加，然后最终由于在英俊脸庞上刻下皱纹的相同过程而减少。但有时随机因素不会平均化。这种情况发生的频率有多高，异常有多大？
- en: 'From the player’s yearly statistics you can estimate his probability of hitting
    a home run at each opportunity—that is, on each trip to the plate.[^(19)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts19a)
    In 1960, the year before his record year, Roger Maris hit 1 home run for every
    14.7 opportunities (about the same as his home run output averaged over his four
    prime years). Let’s call this performance normal Maris. You can model the home
    run hitting skill of normal Maris this way: Imagine a coin that comes up heads
    on average not 1 time every 2 tosses but 1 time every 14.7\. Then flip that coin
    1 time for every trip to the plate and award Maris 1 home run every time the coin
    comes up heads. If you want to match, say, Maris’s 1961 season, you flip the coin
    once for every home run opportunity he had that year. By that method you can generate
    a whole series of alternative 1961 seasons in which Maris’s skill level matches
    the home run totals of normal-Maris. The results of those mock seasons illustrate
    the range of accomplishment that normal Maris could have expected in 1961 if his
    talent had not spiked—that is, given only his “normal” home run ability plus the
    effects of pure luck.'

  zh: 从球员的年度统计数据中，你可以估计他在每个机会击出全垒打的可能性——也就是说，在每次上垒时。[^(19)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts19a)
    在1960年，他创纪录的那一年之前，罗杰·马里斯每14.7次机会击出1个全垒打（大约等同于他四年黄金时期的平均全垒打产量）。让我们称这种表现为准马里斯。你可以这样模拟准马里斯的全垒打击打技巧：想象一个硬币，平均每14.7次投掷才出现一次正面，而不是每两次投掷一次。然后，每次上垒时投掷一次硬币，每次硬币正面朝上时，就给马里斯记一个全垒打。如果你想匹配，比如说，马里斯1961赛季的表现，那么你就在他那年每个全垒打机会时投掷一次硬币。通过这种方法，你可以生成一系列模拟的1961赛季，其中马里斯的技能水平与正常马里斯的全垒打总数相匹配。这些模拟赛季的结果说明了正常马里斯在1961年如果没有他的才能激增的情况下，可以期望达到的成就范围——也就是说，只考虑他的“正常”全垒打能力加上纯粹运气的影响。
- en: To have actually performed this experiment, I’d have needed a rather odd coin,
    a rather strong wrist, and a leave of absence from college. In practice the mathematics
    of randomness allowed me to do the analysis employing equations and a computer.
    In most of my imaginary 1961 seasons, normal Maris’s home run output was, not
    surprisingly, in the range that was normal for Maris. Some mock seasons he hit
    a few more, some a few less. Only rarely did he hit a lot more or a lot less.
    How frequently did normal Maris’s talent produce Ruthian results?

  zh: 要真正进行这个实验，我需要一个相当奇怪的硬币，一个相当强壮的手腕，以及从大学请假。实际上，随机性的数学让我能够使用方程和计算机进行分析。在我的大多数想象中的1961赛季中，普通马里斯的本垒打产出，不出所料，都在马里斯的正常范围内。有些模拟赛季他击出了更多的本垒打，有些则击出了更少的本垒打。他很少击出很多或很少的本垒打。普通马里斯的天赋多久能产生鲁斯式的结果？
- en: 'I had expected normal Maris’s chances of matching Ruth’s record to be roughly
    equal to Jack Whittaker’s when he plopped down an extra dollar as he bought breakfast
    biscuits at a convenience store a few years back and ended up winning $314 million
    in his state Powerball lottery. That’s what a less talented player’s chances would
    have been. But normal Maris, though not Ruthian, was still far above average at
    hitting home runs. And so normal Maris’s probability of producing a record output
    by chance was not microscopic: he matched or broke Ruth’s record about 1 time
    every 32 seasons. That might not sound like good odds, and you probably wouldn’t
    have wanted to bet on either Maris or the year 1961 in particular. But those odds
    lead to a striking conclusion. To see why, let’s now ask a more interesting question.
    Let’s consider *all* players with the talent of normal Maris and the *entire*
    seventy-year period from Ruth’s record to the start of the “steroid era” (when,
    because of players’ drug use, home runs became far more common). What are the
    odds that *some* player at *some* time would have matched or broken Ruth’s record
    by chance alone? Is it reasonable to believe that Maris just happened to be the

  zh: 我原本预期普通马里斯匹配鲁斯记录的机会与几年前他在便利店买早餐饼干时多投了一美元，最终赢得他州彩票3.14亿美元的机会大致相等。这就是一个天赋较低球员的机会。但普通马里斯，尽管不是鲁斯式的，但在击球方面仍然远超平均水平。因此，普通马里斯偶然产生创纪录产出的概率并不微小：他大约每32个赛季就能匹配或打破鲁斯的记录一次。这可能听起来不是什么好机会，你可能不会想对马里斯或1961年特别下注。但这些概率导致了一个引人注目的结论。为了理解为什么，我们现在来问一个更有趣的问题。让我们考虑所有具有普通马里斯天赋的球员，以及从鲁斯的记录开始到“类固醇时代”开始（由于球员使用药物，本垒打变得更为普遍）的整整七十年。仅凭偶然，某个时间某个球员匹配或打破鲁斯记录的概率是多少？相信马里斯只是偶然成为那个幸运的异常赛季的受益者是否合理？
- en: History shows that in that period there was about 1 player every 3 years with
    both the talent and the opportunities comparable to those of normal Maris in 1961\.
    When you add it all up, that makes the probability that by chance alone one of
    those players would have matched or broken Ruth’s record a little greater than
    50 percent. In other words, over a period of seventy years a random spike of 60
    or more home runs for a player whose production process merits more like 40 home
    runs is to be expected—a phenomenon something like that occasional loud crackle
    you hear amid the static in a bad telephone connection. It is also to be expected,
    of course, that we will deify, or vilify—and certainly endlessly analyze—whoever
    that “lucky” person turns out to be.
