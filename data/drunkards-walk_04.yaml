    on chance, he could have made a tidy profit betting against less sophisticated
    players. Today, with what he had to offer, Cardano could have achieved both fame
    and fortune writing books like *The Idiot’s Guide to Casting Dice with Suckers.*
    But in his own time, Cardano’s work made no big splash, and his *Book on Games
    of Chance* remained unpublished until long after his death. Why did Cardano’s
    work have so little impact? As we’ve said, one hindrance to those who preceded
    him was the lack of a good system of algebraic notation. That system in Cardano’s
    day was improving but was still in its infancy. Another roadblock, however, had
    yet to be removed: Cardano worked at a time when mystical incantation was more
    valued than mathematical calculation. If people did not look for the order in
    nature and did not develop numerical descriptions of events, then a theory of
    the effect of randomness on those events was bound to go unappreciated. As it
    turned out, had Cardano lived just a few decades later, both his work and its
    reception might have been far different, for the decades after his death saw the
    unfolding of historic changes in European thought and belief, a transformation
    that has traditionally been dubbed the scientific revolution.'

    as Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, an era in which people’s beliefs about
    the way the world worked were not scrutinized in any systematic manner. Merchants
    in one town stole the clothes off a hanged man because they believed it would
    help their sales of beer. Parishioners in another believed illness could be cured
    by chanting sacrilegious prayers as they marched naked around their church altar.[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c04-nts1a)
    One trader even believed that relieving himself in the “wrong” toilet would bring

    adhere to superstitions today, but at least today, for those who are interested,
    we have the intellectual tools to prove or disprove the efficacy of such actions.
    But if Cardano’s contemporaries, say, won at dice, rather than analyzing their
    experience mathematically, they would say a prayer of thanks or refuse to wash
    their lucky socks. Cardano himself believed that streaks of losses occur because
    “fortune is averse” and that one way to improve your results is to give the dice
    a good hard throw. If a lucky 7 is all in the wrist, why stoop to mathematics?

- en: 'The moment that is often considered the turning point for the scientific revolution
    came in 1583, just seven years after Cardano’s death. That is when a young student
    at the University of Pisa sat in a cathedral and, according to legend, rather
    than listening to the services, stared at something he found far more intriguing:
    the swinging of a large hanging lamp. Using his pulse as a timer, Galileo Galilei
    noticed that the lamp seemed to take the same amount of time to swing through
    a wide arc as it did to swing through a narrow one. That observation suggested
    to him a law: the time required by a pendulum to perform a swing is independent
    of the amplitude of the swing. Galileo’s was a precise and practical observation,
    and although simple, it signified a new approach to the description of physical
    phenomena: the idea that science must focus on experience and experimentation—how
    nature operates—rather than on what intuition dictates or our minds find appealing.
    And most of all, it must be done with mathematics.'

  zh: 通常被认为科学革命转折点的时刻发生在1583年，卡达诺去世后的第七年。那是一个年轻的比萨大学学生坐在大教堂里的时候，根据传说，他并没有听宗教仪式，而是盯着他发现远比仪式更有趣的东西：一个大吊灯的摆动。利用他的脉搏作为计时器，伽利略·伽利莱注意到，吊灯似乎在摆动一个宽弧和摆动一个窄弧所需的时间是相同的。这个观察让他想到一个定律：摆钟完成摆动所需的时间与摆动的幅度无关。伽利略的观察是精确且实用的，尽管简单，但它标志着对物理现象描述的新方法：科学必须关注经验和实验——自然如何运作——而不是直觉所指示的或我们心中所认为吸引人的。最重要的是，这必须用数学来完成。

    “Thoughts about Dice Games.” The work was produced at the behest of his patron,
    the grand duke of Tuscany. The problem that bothered the grand duke was this:
    when you throw three dice, why does the number 10 appear more frequently than
    the number 9? The excess of 10s is only about 8 percent, and neither 10 nor 9
    comes up very often, so the fact that the grand duke played enough to notice the
    small difference means he probably needed a good twelve-step program more than
    he needed Galileo. For whatever reason, Galileo was not keen to work on the problem

    as if you were a Talmudic scholar: rather than attempting to explain why 10 comes
    up more frequently than 9, we ask, *why shouldn’t 10 come up more frequently than
    9?* It turns out there is a tempting reason to believe that the dice should sum
    to 10 and 9 with equal frequency: both 10 and 9 can be constructed in 6 ways from
    the throw of three dice. For 9 we can write those ways as (621), (531), (522),
    (441), (432), and (333). For 10 they are (631), (622), (541), (532), (442), and
    (433). According to Cardano’s law of the sample space, the probability of obtaining
    a favorable outcome is equal to the proportion of outcomes that are favorable.

- en: 'The reason is that, as I’ve said, the law of the sample space in its original
    form applies only to outcomes that are equally probable, and the combinations
    listed above are not. For instance, the outcome (631)—that is, throwing a 6, a
    3, and a 1—is 6 times more likely than the outcome (333) because although there
    is only 1 way you can throw three 3s, there are 6 ways you can throw a 6, a 3,
    and a 1: you can throw a 6 first, then a 3, and then a 1, or you can throw a 1
    first, then a 3, then a 6, and so on. Let’s represent an outcome in which we are
    keeping track of the order of throws by a triplet of numbers separated by commas.
    Then the short way of saying what we just said is that the outcome (631) consists
    of the possibilities (1,3,6), (1,6,3), (3,1,6), (3,6,1), (6,1,3), and (6,3,1),
    whereas the outcome (333) consists only of (3,3,3). Once we’ve made this decomposition,
    we can see that the outcomes are equally probable and we can apply the law. Since
    there are 27 ways of rolling a 10 with three dice but only 25 ways to get a total
    of 9, Galileo concluded that with three dice, rolling a 10 was 27/25, or about
    1.08, times more likely.'

  zh: 原因在于，正如我之前所说的，样本空间法则在其原始形式下仅适用于等可能性的结果，而上述列出的组合并不等可能。例如，结果（631）——即掷出6、3和1——比结果（333）的可能性高6倍，因为虽然掷出三个3只有1种方式，但你掷出6、3和1的组合有6种：你可以先掷出6，然后是3，最后是1，或者先掷出1，然后是3，最后是6，以此类推。让我们用由逗号分隔的三个数字表示我们正在跟踪投掷顺序的结果。那么我们刚才所说的简单方式是，结果（631）由以下可能性组成：（1,3,6）、（1,6,3）、（3,1,6）、（3,6,1）、（6,1,3）和（6,3,1），而结果（333）仅由（3,3,3）组成。一旦我们进行了这种分解，我们就可以看到结果的可能性是相等的，我们可以应用这个法则。由于掷三个骰子得到10有27种方式，但得到总和9只有25种方式，伽利略得出结论，掷三个骰子得到10的可能性是27/25，或者说大约是1.08倍。
- en: 'In solving the problem, Galileo implicitly employed our next important principle:
    *The chances of an event depend on the number of ways in which it can occur.*
    That is not a surprising statement. The surprise is just how large that effect
    is—and how difficult it can be to calculate. For example, suppose you give a 10-question
    true-or-false quiz to your class of 25 sixth-graders. Let’s do an accounting of
    the results a particular student might achieve: she could answer all questions
    correctly; she could miss 1 question—that can happen in 10 ways because there
    are 10 questions she could miss; she could miss a pair of questions—that can happen
    in 45 ways because there are 45 distinct pairs of questions; and so on. As a result,
    on average in a collection of students who are randomly guessing, for every student
    scoring 100 percent, you’ll find about 10 scoring 90 percent and 45 scoring 80
    percent. The chances of getting a grade near 50 percent are of course higher still,
    but in a class of 25 the probability that at least one student will get a B (80
    percent) or better if all the students are guessing is about 75 percent. So if
    you are a veteran teacher, it is likely that among all the students over the years
    who have shown up unprepared and more or less guessed at your quizzes, some were
    rewarded with an A or a B.'

    had difficulty swallowing and keeping food down, and suffered from debilitating
    weakness, severe headaches, bouts of sweating, and partial paralysis of the legs.
    He stoically followed the advice of his physicians, which involved bleedings,
    purgings, and the consumption of asses’ milk and other “disgusting” potions that
    he could barely keep from vomiting—a “veritable torture,” according to his sister
    Gilberte.[⁷](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c04-nts7a) Pascal had by then
    left Paris, but in the summer of 1647, aged twenty-four and growing desperate,
    he moved back with his sister Jacqueline in search of better medical care. There
    his new bevy of doctors offered the state-of-the-art advice that Pascal “ought
    to give up all continued mental labor, and should seek as much as possible all
    opportunities to divert himself.”[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c04-nts8a)
    And so Pascal taught himself to kick back and relax and began to spend time in
    the company of other young men of leisure. Then, in 1651, Blaise’s father died,
    and suddenly Pascal was a twenty-something with an inheritance. He put the cash

    因此，帕斯卡学会了放松和休息，并开始与其他有闲的年轻人相处。然后，在1651年，布莱兹的父亲去世，帕斯卡突然成了一个有遗产的二十多岁的人。他把这笔钱用得很好，至少在他医生的角度来看是这样。传记作家称1651年至1654年是帕斯卡的“世俗时期”。他的妹妹吉尔贝特称这段时间为“他人生中最不充实的时间”。[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c04-nts9a)

    itself random. Pascal’s work represents such an occasion, for it was his abandonment
    of study that led him to the study of chance. It all began when one of his partying
    pals introduced him to a forty-five-year-old snob named Antoine Gombaud. Gombaud,
    a nobleman whose title was chevalier de Méré, regarded himself as a master of
    flirtation, and judging by his catalog of romantic entanglements, he was. But
    de Méré was also an expert gambler who liked the stakes high and won often enough
    that some suspected him of cheating. And when he stumbled on a little gambling
    quandary, he turned to Pascal for help. With that, de Méré initiated an investigation
    that would bring to an end Pascal’s scientific dry spell, cement de Méré’s own
    place in the history of ideas, and solve the problem left open by Galileo’s work
    on the grand duke’s dice-tossing question.

    The game is interrupted with one player in the lead. What is the fairest way to

    with whom he could discuss his ideas. Marin Mersenne, the great communicator,
    had died a few years earlier, but Pascal was still wired into the Académie Mersenne

    games of the baseball World Series, in which the first team to win 4 games is
    crowned champion. The fact that the Braves won the first 2 games didn’t necessarily

    were indeed better. Nevertheless, for our current purposes we will stick to the

    2 games just happened to go to the Braves.

- en: 'Given that assumption, what would have been fair odds for a bet on the Yankees—that
    is, what was the chance of a Yankee comeback? To calculate it, we count all the
    ways in which the Yankees could have won and compare that to the number of ways
    in which they could have lost. Two games of the series had been played, so there
    were 5 possible games yet to play. And since each of those games had 2 possible
    outcomes—a Yankee win (Y) or a Braves win (B)—there were 2⁵, or 32, possible outcomes.
    For instance, the Yankees could have won 3, then lost 2: YYYBB; or they could
    have alternated victories: YBYBY. (In the latter case, since the Braves would
    have won 4 games with the 6th game, the last game would never have been played,
    but we’ll get to that in a minute.) The probability that the Yankees would come
    back to win the series was equal to the number of sequences in which they would
    win at least 4 games divided by the total number of sequences, 32; the chance
    that the Braves would win was equal to the number of sequences in which they would

    (such as YBYBY) in which the teams keep playing even after the Braves have won
    the required 4 games. The teams would certainly not play a 7th game once the Braves
    had won 4\. But mathematics is independent of human whim, and whether or not the
    players play the games does not affect the fact that such sequences exist. For
    example, suppose you’re playing a coin-toss game in which you win if at any time
    heads come up. There are 2², or 4, possible two-toss sequences: HT, HH, TH, and
    TT. In the first two of these, you would not bother tossing the coin again because

- en: 'So in order to calculate the Yankees’ and the Braves’ chances of victory, we
    simply make an accounting of the possible 5-game sequences for the remainder of
    the series. First, the Yankees would have been victorious if they had won 4 of
    the 5 possible remaining games. That could have happened in 1 of 5 ways: BYYYY,
    YBYYY, YYBYY, YYYBY, or YYYYB. Alternatively, the Yankees would have triumphed
    if they had won all 5 of the remaining games, which could have happened in only
    1 way: YYYYY. Now for the Braves: they would have become champions if the Yankees
    had won only 3 games, which could have happened in 10 ways (BBYYY, BYBYY, and
    so on), or if the Yankees had won only 2 games (which again could have happened
    in 10 ways), or if the Yankees had won only 1 game (which could have happened
    in 5 ways), or if they had won none (which could have happened in only 1 way).
    Adding these possible outcomes together, we find that the chance of a Yankees
    victory was 6 in 32, or about 19 percent, versus 26 in 32, or about 81 percent
    for the Braves. According to Pascal and Fermat, if the series had abruptly been
    terminated, that’s how they should have split the bonus pot, and those are the
    odds that should have been set if a bet was to be made after the first 2 games.
    For the record, the Yankees did come back to win the next 4 games, and they were

- en: 'The same reasoning could also be applied to the start of the series—that is,
    before any game has been played. If the two teams have equal chances of winning
    each game, you will find, of course, that they have an equal chance of winning
    the series. But similar reasoning works if they don’t have an equal chance, except
    that the simple accounting I just employed would have to be altered slightly:
    each outcome would have to be weighted by a factor describing its relative probability.
    If you do that and analyze the situation at the start of the series, you will
    discover that in a 7-game series there is a sizable chance that the inferior team
    will be crowned champion. For instance, if one team is good enough to warrant
    beating another in 55 percent of its games, the weaker team will nevertheless
    win a 7-game series about 4 times out of 10\. And if the superior team could be
    expected to beat its opponent, on average, 2 out of each 3 times they meet, the
    inferior team will still win a 7-game series about once every 5 matchups. There
    is really no way for sports leagues to change this. In the lopsided ²/[3]-probability
    case, for example, you’d have to play a series consisting of at minimum the best
    of 23 games to determine the winner with what is called statistical significance,
    meaning the weaker team would be crowned champion 5 percent or less of the time
    (see chapter 5). And in the case of one team’s having only a 55–45 edge, the shortest
    statistically significant “world series” would be the best of 269 games, a tedious
    endeavor indeed! So sports playoff series can be fun and exciting, but being crowned
    “world champion” is not a very reliable indication that a team is actually the
    best one.'

  zh: 同样的推理也可以应用于系列赛的开始——也就是说，在任何比赛开始之前。如果两支球队每场比赛都有相等的机会获胜，你会发现，当然，它们赢得系列赛的机会也是相等的。但如果它们没有相等的机会，类似的推理同样适用，只是我刚才使用的简单计算需要稍作调整：每个结果都需要通过一个描述其相对概率的系数进行加权。如果你这样做，并分析系列赛开始的情况，你会发现，在一个7局4胜的系列赛中，较弱的一方成为冠军的可能性相当大。例如，如果一个球队在55%的比赛中足以击败另一个球队，那么较弱的一方在10次中有大约4次会赢得7局4胜的系列赛。而且，如果一支球队在与对手相遇时平均每3次中有2次能获胜，那么较弱的一方在每5次对决中大约有1次会赢得7局4胜的系列赛。体育联盟实际上真的无法改变这一点。例如，在概率不平衡的²/[3]情况下，你至少需要打一个至少是最佳23局的系列赛，才能以所谓的统计显著性确定赢家，这意味着较弱的一方只有5%或更少的时间会被授予冠军（见第5章）。而且，在一个球队只有55-45优势的情况下，最短的具有统计显著性的“世界系列赛”将是最佳269局的比赛，这确实是一项繁琐的任务！所以体育季后赛系列赛可以很有趣和刺激，但成为“世界冠军”并不是一个可靠的指标，表明一支球队实际上是最棒的。

    over decades or centuries. If, for instance, employee A is truly superior and
    would in the long run win a performance comparison with employee B on 60 out of

- en: 'Pascal’s triangle is useful any time you need to know the number of ways in
    which you can choose some number of objects from a collection that has an equal
    or greater number. Here is how it works in the case of the wedding guests: To
    find the number of distinct seatings of 10 you can form from a group of 100 guests,
    you would start by looking down the numbers to the left of the triangle until
    you found the row labeled 100\. The triangle I supplied does not go down that
    far, but for now let’s pretend it does. The first number in row 100 tells you
    the number of ways you can choose 0 guests from a group of 100\. There is just
    1 way, of course: you simply don’t choose anyone. That is true no matter how many
    total guests you are choosing from, which is why the first number in every row
    is a 1\. The second number in row 100 tells you the number of ways you can choose
    1 guest from the group of 100\. There are 100 ways to do that: you can choose
    just guest number 1, or just guest number 2, and so on. That reasoning applies
    to every row, and so the second number in each row is simply the number of that
    row. The third number in each row represents the number of distinct groups of
    2 you can form, and so on. The number we seek—the number of distinct arrangements
    of 10 you can form—is therefore the eleventh number in the row. Even if I had
    extended the triangle to include 100 rows, that number would be far too large
    to put on the page. In fact, when some wedding guest inevitably complains about
    the seating arrangements, you might point out how long it would have taken you
    to consider every possibility: assuming you spent one second considering each
    one, it would come to roughly 10,000 billion years. The unhappy guest will assume,
    of course, that you are being histrionic.'

  zh: 帕斯卡三角形在任何需要知道从具有相等或更多数量的集合中选择一些对象的方式数量时都很有用。以下是如何在婚礼宾客的情况中应用它：要找出从100位宾客中可以形成的10位宾客的不同座位安排数量，你首先需要查看三角形左侧的数字，直到找到标记为100的那一行。我提供的三角形没有延伸到那么远，但为了现在的情况，让我们假设它做到了。第100行的第一个数字告诉你从100位宾客中选择0位宾客的方式数量。当然，只有1种方式：你简单地不选择任何人。这无论你选择多少总宾客都是正确的，这就是为什么每一行的第一个数字都是1的原因。第100行的第二个数字告诉你从100位宾客中选择1位宾客的方式数量。有100种方式可以做到这一点：你可以选择第1位宾客，或者第2位宾客，以此类推。这种推理适用于每一行，因此每一行的第二个数字仅仅是该行的数字。每一行的第三个数字代表你可以形成的2个不同组合的数量，以此类推。我们寻求的数字——你可以形成的10位宾客的不同排列数量——因此是第11个数字。即使我扩展了三角形以包括100行，这个数字也会太大而无法放在页面上。事实上，当一些婚礼宾客不可避免地抱怨座位安排时，你可能会指出考虑每一种可能性需要多长时间：假设你花费一秒钟考虑每一个，这将大约是1000亿年。当然，不高兴的宾客会认为你是在夸张。
- en: 'In order for us to use Pascal’s triangle, let’s say for now that your guest
    list consists of just 10 guests. Then the relevant row is the one at the bottom
    of the triangle I provided, labeled 10\. The numbers in that row represent the
    number of distinct tables of 0, 1, 2, and so on, that can be formed from a collection
    of 10 people. You may recognize these numbers from the sixth-grade quiz example—the
    number of ways in which a student can get a given number of problems wrong on
    a 10-question true-or-false test is the same as the number of ways in which you
    can choose guests from a group of 10\. That is one of the reasons for the power
    of Pascal’s triangle: the same mathematics can be applied to many different situations.
    For the Yankees-Braves World Series example, in which we tediously counted all
    the possibilities for the remaining 5 games, we can now read the number of ways
    in which the Yankees can win 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 games directly from row 5 of

    or not God exists and therefore assign a 50 percent chance to either proposition.
    How should you weigh these odds when deciding whether to lead a pious life? If
    you act piously and God exists, Pascal argued, your gain—eternal happiness—is
    infinite. If, on the other hand, God does not exist, your loss, or negative return,
    is small—the sacrifices of piety. To weigh these possible gains and losses, Pascal
    proposed, you multiply the probability of each possible outcome by its payoff
    and add them all up, forming a kind of average or expected payoff. In other words,
    the mathematical expectation of your return on piety is one-half infinity (your
    gain if God exists) minus one-half a small number (your loss if he does not exist).
    Pascal knew enough about infinity to know that the answer to this calculation
    is infinite, and thus the expected return on piety is infinitely positive. Every
    reasonable person, Pascal concluded, should therefore follow the laws of God.
    Today this argument is known as Pascal’s wager.'

- en: 'To the study of randomness, Pascal contributed both his ideas about counting
    and the concept of mathematical expectation. Who knows what else he might have
    discovered, despite his renouncing mathematics, if his health had held up. But
    it did not. In July 1662, Pascal became seriously ill. His physicians prescribed
    the usual remedies: they bled him and administered violent purges, enemas, and
    emetics. He improved for a while, and then the illness returned, along with severe
    headaches, dizziness, and convulsions. Pascal vowed that if he survived, he would
    devote his life to helping the poor and asked to be moved to a hospital for the
    incurable, in order that, if he died, he would be in their company. He did die,
    a few days later, in August 1662\. He was thirty-nine. An autopsy found the cause
    of death to be a brain hemorrhage, but it also revealed lesions in his liver,
    stomach, and intestines that accounted for the illnesses that had plagued him
    throughout his life.'

  zh: 对于随机性的研究，帕斯卡既贡献了他的计数思想，又提出了数学期望的概念。谁知道如果他的健康状况能够维持，他可能还会发现什么，尽管他放弃了数学。但事实并非如此。1662年7月，帕斯卡病重。他的医生们开出了常规的治疗方法：他们放血，并给予剧烈的泻药、灌肠和催吐剂。他的病情一度有所好转，但随后疾病再次发作，伴随着剧烈的头痛、头晕和抽搐。帕斯卡发誓，如果他能够幸存下来，他将致力于帮助穷人，并请求被转移到一家收容不治之症的医院，以便如果他在那里去世，他能够与那些人在一起。几天后，他在1662年8月去世。尸检发现死亡原因是脑出血，但也揭示了他在肝脏、胃和肠道中的病变，这些病变解释了他一生中一直困扰着他的疾病。
