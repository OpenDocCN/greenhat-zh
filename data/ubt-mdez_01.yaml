    chapter we’ll do just that by introducing you to the world of Linux. We’ll then
    get you up to snuff on what this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want
    to install and use it, and what you will need in order to do so. For those of
    you who already have joined the Linux world and have Ubuntu or another distribution
    installed on your machines, some of this may be old news, but a few bits of information
    may still be of interest to you. For those others who may be curious but are still
    unsure whether or not to take the plunge, or those of you who have no idea what
    Linux even is and have picked up this book to find out, this chapter will prove
    especially useful.

    or worries you might have had will have been dispelled; and your questions, for
    the most part, will be answered. If you are reluctant to make a commitment by
    installing Ubuntu on your hard disk, remember that you can still follow along
    because the disc that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu
    installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu
    Linux experience without having to even touch your hard drive.

    its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no
    windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are
    behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen,

- en: Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing
    commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is
    used as a server), you don’t have to do that. It is fair to say that with the
    advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,
    pronounced “goo-ee”), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They
    began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which

    as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux
    mascot, and what has come to be thought of as *the* Linux penguin was designed
    by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see [Figure 1-1](ch01.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot
    "Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot")). This explains not only the ornithological
    references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin
    icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include *penguin* or *Tux*
    in their names, such as TuxRacer, Tux Paint, and Pingus. This, combined with the
    fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes
    referred to as Penguinistas. True, Ubuntu doesn’t play up the penguin as much
    as other distributions, but Linux is Linux so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too
    . . . just a bit less conspicuously.

    "图1-1. Tux，Linux的吉祥物")）。这不仅解释了书中贯穿的鸟类的参考和图形，还解释了为什么Linux发行版中有那么多企鹅图标，以及为什么许多程序的名字中包含*penguin*或*Tux*，例如TuxRacer、Tux
    Paint和Pingus。这一点，加上Linux是一个革命性的操作系统的事实，有助于解释为什么Linux用户有时被称为Penguinistas。诚然，Ubuntu不像其他发行版那样突出企鹅，但Linux就是Linux，所以企鹅也住在Ubuntu里……只是不那么显眼。

    it gives them total control over almost everything, from how things behave to
    how they look; in other words, Linux lets them geek around. Others like it because
    of the stability Linux is noted for. Try running your current system for a month
    without restarting and see what happens. Linux has been known to run without a

    see whether you can identify what part of your hardware puzzle is causing your
    problems. (Or if you are looking to buy a machine on which to install Ubuntu,
    you can search for hardware that is supported by Linux.) Of course, before you
    can do this, you need to know what models of hardware you have. You should know
    at least what motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, and video card
    you have if you want to be able to find out anything of value. Identifying your
    CPU and monitor should be easy enough, but the motherboard and video card may
    require a bit more searching.

    devices, you can find out most things you need to know from within Windows by
    going to the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking **System**, and then clicking
    the **Hardware** tab in that window. Once on the Hardware tab, click the **Device
    Manager** button and see what you can find out about your system components. Sometimes
    the information there is limited, so you might instead want to try a shareware
    application such as HWiNFO ([http://www.hwinfo.com/](http://www.hwinfo.com/))

    just open the case of your computer and look at your board. Note that I wouldn’t
    recommend doing this if you have a laptop. Once inside, you needn’t worry about
    damaging anything because you don’t need to touch anything—so don’t. You may need
    a flashlight to find it, but the model name and number should be stamped on there
    somewhere, either in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example,
    says quite clearly in the middle of the board “AOpen MX46-533V.” You should be
    looking for similar information.

    words, running your machine on too little RAM is sort of like trying to do jumping
