- en: '**Comprehensiveness** Like most authors writing a resource that covers a large
    subject, I wanted *The TCP/IP Guide* to be comprehensive. Of course, no single
    document can cover everything, so I have needed to limit the scope of the material.

- en: '**Comprehensibility** Creating a resource that is comprehensive is important,
    but I felt that it was even more important that the book be *comprehensible*.
    Over the past few years, I''ve had the opportunity to review many hundreds of
    books, guides, websites, and papers related to networking. I have found that even
    though most of them are generally high in quality, too many use unexplained technical
    jargon or assume extensive prior knowledge of networking concepts and technologies
    on the part of the reader. I worked very hard to ensure that my descriptions,
    even of very complex concepts, can be understood by almost every student of networking.'

- en: '**Rationale** It''s certainly important to know how every TCP/IP protocol functions.
    However, to gain a true understanding of complex material, one also needs to understand
    the reasons behind why things are what they are. In writing this material, I have
    always tried to explain not just the *what*, but also the *why* of TCP/IP. I have
    anticipated and answered questions that I believe might commonly arise in the
    mind of someone learning about this technology.'

- en: '**Illustrations** A picture is worth a thousand words, as they say. There are
    many concepts that no amount of verbiage will adequately explain, while a simple
    illustration will do the trick. For this reason, I spent many months creating
    more than 300 diagrams (some simple and some not so simple!) to complement the
    written material in *The TCP/IP Guide*.'

- en: '**User-friendliness** I have intentionally broken many of the rules of conventional
    book authorship, in creating a document that uses a conversational, first-person
    style, and no small amount of humor where appropriate. My intention was to make
    you feel at home while you read material that can be quite technically difficult.

    one after the other, leaving the reader to wonder how everything fits together.

    式涵盖了其主题。'
- en: '**Multiple levels of detail** I realize that some people reading a TCP/IP book
    might want only a quick summary of the operation of its constituent protocols,
    while others want to learn all the nuances of how everything works. I have provided

    or concept, I start with a modest goal regarding how much I want to write. I always
    begin knowing that I really need to control myself, to prevent my project from
    going on forever. But as I explore each subject, I learn more and more, and I
    start to say to myself things like, "This is important. I simply *must* include
    coverage for it," and, "If I''m going to cover subject #1, I also should cover

- en: However, even though self-control in this area is a weakness for me, even I
    realized I could not possibly cover *everything* related to TCP/IP in this book.
    Consider that the TCP/IP suite contains dozens of protocols and technologies,
    each written about in thick books. I was willing to spend years on this project,

    TCP/IP protocol suite. The material here is designed to allow a student to learn
    the nuts and bolts of how TCP/IP works. I do discuss quite a number of "real-world"
    practical issues related to how TCP/IP internetworks operate, but this is not
    my primary focus here. If you want to really understand what TCP/IP is and what
    makes it work, you''ve come to the right place. If all you want is simple instructions
    on how to connect a few PCs together in your home using TCP/IP, this probably
    isn''t the book for you.'

- en: '**Current versus future protocols** Most of the emphasis in this book is on
    the present state of the art in TCP/IP. The suite is always changing, new protocols
    are constantly being written, and revisions to existing protocols continue to
    be published. I have not provided extensive coverage of technologies still in
    development, to try to keep the size of the book manageable and to prevent the
    book from being out-of-date before it even hits the store shelves. The one exception
    to this general rule of thumb is version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6), which
    represents a significant change to the core of how most of TCP/IP operates. While
    not universally deployed yet, IPv6 is sufficiently far along in its development
    that I feel any student of TCP/IP needs to know what it is, learn how it works,
    and understand its significance. Thus, I have included several detailed chapters
    on IPv6, and also mentioned how it impacts the operation of several other key
    protocols such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Domain Name System
    (DNS), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).'

  zh: '**当前与未来协议** 本书的大部分重点在于TCP/IP的现状。套件总是在变化中，新的协议不断被编写，现有协议的修订也在持续发布。我没有提供对仍在开发中的技术的广泛覆盖，以保持本书的规模可控，并防止本书在上架之前就过时。这一一般规则的例外是互联网协议的第6版（IPv6），它对TCP/IP大多数操作的核心进行了重大改变。尽管尚未得到广泛应用，但IPv6在其开发中已经足够成熟，我认为任何TCP/IP的学生都需要了解它是什么，学习它是如何工作的，并理解其重要性。因此，我包括了几个关于IPv6的详细章节，并提到了它如何影响其他几个关键协议的操作，如互联网控制消息协议（ICMP）、域名系统（DNS）和动态主机配置协议（DHCP）。'
- en: '**Application coverage** Many thousands of different applications run on TCP/IP
    internetworks, and I could not possibly hope to describe all of them. The scope
    of this book is limited to the most important, "classic" TCP/IP applications and

    World Wide Web.'

- en: '**TCP/IP versus the Internet** The TCP/IP protocol suite and the Internet are
    very closely related in many ways, as you will discover as you read this book.
    In fact, they are often tied together so much that it is hard to discuss one without
    the other. However, the Internet as a whole is an enormous subject, and trying
    to describe it in general terms would have substantially increased the size of
    this book. Thus, I describe Internet issues only within the context of explanations
    of TCP/IP technologies. For example, while I cover the World Wide Web in this
    book, I discuss its generalities only briefly. I focus my technical discussions
    on how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that implements it works. I don''t
    talk about how to set up a website, how to choose a web browser, or any of those

    true of some of my diagrams. In these cases, my preference has generally been
