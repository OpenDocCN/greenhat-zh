- en: A company I worked with had a communications line that would fail every day
    at exactly 5:00 p.m. Every morning it would automatically start up around 7:00
    a.m. Extensive checks of both the hardware revealed nothing. Finally, an engineer
    was assigned to stay after hours and watch the communications line. That night
    the problem went away.

  zh: 我曾工作的一家公司有一个通信线路，每天下午5:00准时失效。每天早上大约7:00它会自动启动。对硬件进行了广泛的检查，但都没有发现问题。最后，指派了一名工程师在下班后留下来监控通信线路。那天晚上问题消失了。
- en: The next night the communications went down as usual. The next night the engineer
    stayed late and the problem went away. After several cycles of this it was determined
    that the communications line would crash at 5:00 p.m. unless an engineer was watching
    it.

  zh: 第二个晚上，通信系统如往常一样中断。第二天晚上，工程师加班并解决了问题。经过几次这样的循环后，确定除非有工程师在监控，否则通信线路将在下午5:00崩溃。
- en: Finally one night an engineer decided to make a final check of the communications
    modem before leaving for the day. It was working. He turned out the lights and
    happened to glance back at the modem. It was dead. Turned on the lights, it came
    back on. Flipping the light switch on and off he found out that the modem was
    plugged into a switch wall socket.

  zh: 最后一个晚上，一名工程师决定在离开前对通信调制解调器进行最后的检查。它当时是工作的。他关掉了灯，碰巧回头看了调制解调器一眼。它已经死了。打开灯，它又恢复了。开关灯，他发现调制解调器插在了一个开关电源插座上。
- en: Mystery solved. When the staff left for the day, they turned off the lights,
    killing the modem. When they came in the next day, they turned on the lights.
    The engineer couldn't find the problem when he pulled his all-nighters because
    he left the lights on so he could watch the equipment.
