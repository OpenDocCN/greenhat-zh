    the sharing of resources. Specifically, the network designer must decide whether
    or not to dedicate resource management functions to the devices that constitute

    others, each computer is responsible for a particular job in the overall function

    frequencies or light. WLANs can be entirely wireless, but most are not. They usually

    network classes precisely. In some cases it's not the definitions that decide

    them, many would say you have a WAN, even if all the devices in that technology
    are near each other. On the other hand, some LAN technologies allow for the use

    connect not only individual computers, but also groups of computers. Thus, network
    connections can exist at multiple levels; one network can be attached to another
    network, and that entire network can be attached to another set of networks, and
    so on. The ultimate example of this is, of course, the Internet, which is a huge
    collection of networks that have been interconnected into…dare I say, a web?

    domain for the network. *Collision domain* is a term that refers generally to
    a collection of hardware devices in which only one can transmit at a time. Devices
    such as hubs and repeaters were used to extend collision domains by connecting
    together these segments of cable into wider networks. Over time, the terms *collision

- en: However, the process involved in creating these standards is often a difficult
    one. In some cases, the standards organization will draft the standard from the
    ground up, but in others, it may select one technology as the basis for the standard
    from several that are submitted in what is commonly called a "technology bake-off."
    Thus, many different companies may come to the table with different approaches,
    each of them vying for selection as the standard for use by the group. Politics
    can cause groups to get bogged down for years fighting over various options, or
    even to split into multiple groups. Good examples are what occurred in the conflict
    between supporters of 100VG-AnyLAN and Fast Ethernet, and the problems with standards
    politics that have plagued the world of powerline networking.

- en: A good example of a de facto standard is the AT command set used by modems.
    Virtually all modems use it, but this acceptance didn't result from an industry
    group agreeing to adopt and deploy it. Rather, it was developed unilaterally by
    Hayes, the pioneering modem company, and then adopted by virtually every other
    modem maker until it became a standard.

- en: One reason why proprietary standards are still sometimes seen is that some companies
    want to produce a standard that will become so universally used that it becomes
    the de facto standard, thus giving them a leadership position in that market.
    Again, in my estimation, Sony falls into this category—the developers often want

- en: Sometimes this succeeds, but often it does not, resulting in a fragmented market
    of incompatible products. An excellent example is when Sony created a new format
    for a digital camera's flash memory (the Memory Stick) rather than using the CompactFlash
    format used by other camera manufacturers. The end result was that not everyone
    used memory sticks as Sony had hoped, and there were now two incompatible standards

    "Table 4-1. Binary Information Group Representations and Terms") are worth special
    mention. A bit is also sometimes called a *flag*; this term is most often heard
    when a bit is used by itself to represent a particular information state. For
    example, a computer might use a Changed flag to represent whether a particular
    file has been modified; this is an analogy to a flag either being raised or lowered
    to indicate a condition. These flags are often seen in networking message formats.

- en: The term *character* is also used to express a set of 8 bits. This use comes
    from the fact that computers often store alphanumeric characters, such as letters
    and numbers, one to a byte. The 16-bit *word* is used fairly often, but not nearly
    as much as *byte*. The larger collections of bits, such as double word and so
    on, are not often encountered in everyday parlance; they are used to represent
    chunks of data in technical fields such as hardware design or programming.

    takes some practice to get used to thinking of letters as numbers). Still, hexadecimal
    is particularly useful as a way to compactly represent binary information. Where
    1,000,000 in decimal numbers is 11110100001001000000 in binary, it is only F4240
    in hexadecimal numbers—even shorter than the decimal number, since 16 is larger
    than 10\. Also, a single byte has 8 bits, so it can be represented using only
    two hexadecimal digits. This is why hexadecimal numbers are widely used in computing
    and networking. For example, you will often see hexadecimal numbers used as network
    addresses or representing different types of information in frame or packet formats.

    number with the 1 in that place from the second number, thereby yielding a raw

  zh: '**关键概念** *OR* 和 *AND* 布尔函数的特性使它们在需要设置（改变为 1）或清除（改变为 0）数据项的某些位时非常有用。这个过程称为 *位掩码*。要设置位为
    1，创建一个掩码并将其与输入进行位位 OR 操作。当掩码的值为 1 时，位被强制设置为 1，而每个 0 位则保持相应的原始位不变。同样，与 AND 函数一起使用的掩码会清除某些位；掩码中的每个
    1 位保持原始位不变，而每个 0 位则将输出强制设置为 0。最后，*XOR* 可以使用掩码来反转选定的位。'
