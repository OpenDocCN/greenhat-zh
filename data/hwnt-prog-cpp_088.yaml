- en: A programmer at IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center had a problem. When he
    was sitting down, everything went fine. When he stood up, the computer failed.
    Now this problem was interesting in that it was completely repeatable. When he
    stood up, the machine always failed, and when he sat down it always worked. Nothing
    flaky about this problem.

  zh: 国际商业机器公司（IBM）的Yorktown Heights研究中心的一位程序员遇到了一个问题。当他坐着时，一切正常。当他站起来时，电脑就失败了。这个问题很有趣，因为它完全可以重复。当他站起来时，机器总是失败，当他坐下时，它总是工作。这个问题没有丝毫的不稳定。
- en: The people in the computer office were baffled. After all, how could the computer
    know when the guy was standing or sitting? All sorts of theories were floated,
    such as static electricity, magnetic fields, and even acts of a playful God.

  zh: 计算机办公室的人感到困惑。毕竟，电脑怎么能知道这个人是在站着还是坐着呢？提出了各种各样的理论，比如静电、磁场，甚至是顽皮上帝的行为。
- en: The most likely theory was that there was something loose under the carpet.
    It was a nice theory, but unfortunately it didn't fit the facts. Loose wires tend
    to cause intermittent problems, but this was 100 percent reproducible.

  zh: 最有可能的理论是地毯下有东西松了。这是一个不错的理论，但不幸的是，它不符合事实。松散的电线往往会引起间歇性问题，但这个问题是100%可重复的。
- en: Finally a sharp-eyed engineer noticed something. When the programmer sat down,
    he touch typed. When he stood up, he used the hunt and peck method. A careful
    examination of the keyboard revealed that two of the keys had been reversed. This
    didn't matter when the fellow sat down and touch-typed. But when he rose and used
    the hunt-and-peck method, he was misled by the reversed keys and input the wrong
    data.

  zh: 最后，一位细心的工程师注意到了一些情况。当程序员坐下时，他会进行触摸打字。当他站起来时，他使用的是点字法。仔细检查键盘后发现，有两个键被反转了。当这个人坐下并触摸打字时，这并不重要。但是当他站起来并使用点字法时，他被反转的键误导，输入了错误的数据。
