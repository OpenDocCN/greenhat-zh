    general management or personnel problems—both good topics to discuss with another

    Asking a peer manager for advice shows that you respect his or her abilities and

    background may dig into the technology, sometimes overemphasizing its importance
    over market and customers. CEOs with a marketing background may value the product

    your boss's background, you can determine the best ways to provide him or her

    want to undertake. So, for example, with a finance-focused CEO, you could make
    the case for the revenue benefits of your efforts; with an operations-focused
    CEO, you could emphasize productivity; and with a marketing-focused CEO, you could
    spotlight the market penetration benefits.

    early and working with other executives to resolve problems can yield the best
    results for you and the company. For example, if a software defect leads to a
    major problem with a client, the sales VP needs to know so he can talk to the

- en: Long sales cycles (6 to 12 months) are common for expensive and complex software.
    Long sales cycles are also common for *software as a service (SAS)* offerings
    in which the long-term customer costs of the relationship are high. For these
    types of software purchases, customers investigate the product and service thoroughly
    before making a purchase because of the potential impact to their businesses.
    This investigation often starts with a *request for quote (RFQ)*, sometimes called
    a *request for procurement* (or a *proposal*). An RFQ usually requires that engineering
    contribute information.

  zh: 长的销售周期（6到12个月）对于昂贵且复杂的软件来说是常见的。对于长期客户关系成本较高的“软件即服务（SAS）”产品，长销售周期也很常见。对于这类软件购买，客户在做出购买决定之前会彻底调查产品和服务，因为这对他们的业务可能产生潜在影响。这种调查通常从“报价请求（RFQ）”开始，有时也称为“采购请求”（或“提案”）。RFQ通常要求工程提供信息。
- en: Customers will issue RFQs for expensive software and expect a quote from the
    company that indicates price and often specific services and new program features.
    Typically, the sales team will be responsible for supplying RFQ responses. Sales
    will send customer requests to development and other teams to provide the information
    required to complete the quote. Most RFQs include questions appropriate for engineering
    that help the customer assess how the software works as well as its risks and
    reliability. Typically, the RFQ requires a quick turnaround from engineering.
    Responses must be factually accurate, compact, and understandable, and they must
    highlight the positive aspects of the product.

  zh: 客户将发布昂贵的软件RFQ，并期望公司提供一个表明价格以及通常具体服务和新程序功能的报价。通常，销售团队将负责提供RFQ响应。销售将向开发和其他团队发送客户请求，以提供完成报价所需的信息。大多数RFQ都包含适合工程的问题，帮助客户评估软件的工作方式以及其风险和可靠性。通常，RFQ需要工程部门快速响应。响应必须事实准确、简洁易懂，并突出产品的积极方面。
- en: 'Because supporting sales to respond to RFQs means development must quickly
    deliver information, preparation is critical. First, engineering must work with
    sales to devise a request process that defines how the sales team communicates
    requests to you, what information is included in the RFQs, and how engineering
    will respond. Failing to create a process will lead to mistakes, such as the following:'

    quicker the estimate, the more extra time you can insert to make sure that deliverables
    are released on time. When you create time estimates, make sure you clearly describe
    the quoted functionality and the accuracy of the estimate. In some cases, providing
    estimates based on rough time ranges can be useful to sales and the customer as
    long as sales doesn't use them to price and sign the deal. ([Chapter 12](ch12.html
