- en: A system administrator for a major university was responsible for keeping several
    hundred DEC machines running. He quickly learned how to diagnose broken machines
    and figure out which board was bad. To get a steady supply of spare parts he had
    to purchase a service contract. This meant that a DEC service representative was
    supposed to come down, diagnose the machines, and figure out which board was bad
    and replace it. In practice, the university staff had strict orders to never let
    the DEC service representative near the machines.

  zh: 一所大型大学的系统管理员负责维护数百台 DEC 机器的运行。他很快学会了如何诊断损坏的机器并找出哪块板子坏了。为了获得稳定的备件供应，他不得不购买服务合同。这意味着
    DEC 服务代表应该下来，诊断机器，找出哪块板子坏了并更换它。实际上，大学员工有严格的命令，永远不要让 DEC 服务代表接近机器。
- en: A typical service would start with the administrator telling DEC which board
    was bad. The service representative would come down, find the broken board on
    the administrator's desk, and replace it with a good one. No running diagnostics
    or other work, that was all done for him.

  zh: 典型的服务通常从管理员告诉 DEC 哪块板子坏了开始。服务代表会下来，在管理员的桌子上找到损坏的板子，并用一块好的板子替换它。不需要运行诊断或其他工作，这一切都为他准备好了。
- en: A few years later, DEC instituted a "Smart Spares" program. The idea was that
    you had someone trained, on site, who could figure out which board was bad and
    order a replacement from DEC. Of course this suited the university, because it
    had been operating that way for years.

  zh: 几年后，DEC 实施了“智能备件”计划。这个想法是，你有一个受过培训的人在现场，可以找出哪块板子坏了，并从 DEC 订购替换件。当然，这对大学来说很合适，因为它已经这样做了好几年。
- en: The catch was that you had to take a class, at DEC, to learn how to diagnose
    systems. The system administrator jumped at this opportunity. He needed the vacation.
    He practically slept through the two days of classes. The third day was devoted
    to a lab. The instructor had set up three machines. The students were divided
    into groups and were supposed to spend the morning finding out what was wrong
    with their machine.

  zh: 但问题是，你必须参加 DEC 的课程，学习如何诊断系统。系统管理员抓住了这个机会。他需要休假。他几乎在两天的课程中睡着了。第三天是实验室。讲师设置了三台机器。学生们被分成小组，应该花整个上午的时间找出他们的机器出了什么问题。
- en: Our hero turned on his machine, looked at the flashing lights for a minute,
    and then said, "Bad disk card." The instructor was a little surprised." "How do
    you know that?"

    have worked faster.)

    problem. This one has been set up by field service and was supposed to have a

- en: The instructor knew the problem couldn't be identified by looking at the lights
    and waited to see what our hero would do. The guy opened the back, and even before
    he hit the "On" switch pointed to a board and said "That board is bad; chip U18\.
    It'll cause an intermittent data bus parity error."

    board is from the university. I'm the one who originally found the problem and
    showed it to DEC field service."
