    his most recent English essay. He had received a 93\. Under normal circumstances
    I would have congratulated him on earning an A. And since it was a low A and I
    know him to be capable of better, I would have added that this grade was evidence
    that if he put in a little effort, he could score even higher next time. But these
    were not normal circumstances, and in this case I considered the grade of 93 to
    be a shocking underestimation of the quality of the essay. At this point you might
    think that the previous few sentences tell you more about me than about Alexei.
    If so, you’re right on target. In fact, the above episode is entirely about me,
    for it was I who wrote Alexei’s essay.'

    his request late on the night before the paper was due. I told him I’d get back
    to him. Proceeding to read it on the computer, I first made a couple of minor
    changes, nothing worth bothering to note. Then, being a relentless rewriter, I
    gradually found myself sucked in, rearranging this and rewriting that, and before
    I finished, not only had he fallen asleep, but I had made the essay my own. The

    he told me. “A 93 is really more of an A- than an A, but it was late and I’m sure
    if you were more awake, you would have done better.” I was not happy. First of
    all, it is unpleasant when a fifteen-year-old says the very words to you that
    you have previously said to him, and nevertheless you find his words inane. But
    beyond that, how could my material—the work of a person whom my mother, at least,
    thinks of as a professional writer—not make the grade in a high school English
    class? Apparently I am not alone. Since then I have been told of another writer
    who had a similar experience, except his daughter received a B. Apparently the
    writer, with a PhD in English, writes well enough for *Rolling Stone, Esquire,*
    and *The New York Times* but not for English 101\. Alexei tried to comfort me
    with another story: two of his friends, he said, once turned in identical essays.
    He thought that was stupid and they’d both be suspended, but not only did the
    overworked teacher not notice, she gave one of the essays a 90 (an A) and the
    other a 79 (a C). (Sounds odd unless, like me, you’ve had the experience of staying

    how could poor Mrs. Finnegan (not her real name) distinguish so finely between

    an essay is somehow definable, we must still recognize that a grade is not a description
    of an essay’s degree of quality but rather a *measurement* of it, and one of the
    most important ways randomness affects us is through its influence on measurement.

    Since the original vote count was so close, state law required a recount. In that

    anyone thought it was a bad sign that the 219-vote difference between the first
    and second vote counts was several times larger than the new margin of victory,
    but the upshot was a third vote count, this one entirely “by hand.” The 42-vote
    victory amounted to an edge of just 1 vote out of each 70,000 cast, so the hand-counting
    effort could be compared to asking 42 people to count from 1 to 70,000 and then
    hoping they averaged less than 1 mistake each. Not surprisingly, the result changed
    again. This time it favored the Democrat by 10 votes. That number was later changed

- en: The imprecision of measurement became a major issue in the mid-eighteenth century,
    when one of the primary occupations of those working in celestial physics and
    mathematics was the problem of reconciling Newton’s laws with the observed motions
    of the moon and planets. One way to produce a single number from a set of discordant
    measurements is to take the average, or mean. It seems to have been young Isaac
    Newton who, in his optical investigations, first employed it for that purpose.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts2a)
    But as in many things, Newton was an anomaly. Most scientists in Newton’s day,
    and in the following century, didn’t take the mean. Instead, they chose the single
    “golden number” from among their measurements—the number they deemed mainly by
    hunch to be the most reliable result they had. That’s because they regarded variation
    in measurement not as the inevitable by-product of the measuring process but as
    evidence of failure—with, at times, even moral consequences. In fact, they rarely
    published multiple measurements of the same quantity, feeling it would amount
    to the admission of a botched process and raise the issue of trust. But in the
    mid-eighteenth century the tide began to change. Calculating the gross motion
    of heavenly bodies, a series of nearly circular ellipses, is a simple task performed
    today by precocious high school students as music blares through their headphones.
    But to describe planetary motion in its finer points, taking into account not
    only the gravitational pull of the sun but also that of the other planets and
    the deviation of the planets and the moon from a perfectly spherical shape, is
    even today a difficult problem. To accomplish that goal, complex and approximate
    mathematics had to be reconciled with imperfect observation and measurement.

  zh: 测量的不精确性在18世纪中叶成为了一个主要问题，当时在天体物理学和数学领域工作的主要任务是解决如何将牛顿定律与月球和行星的观测运动相协调的问题。从一组不一致的测量值中产生一个单一数字的一种方法就是取平均值或均值。似乎正是年轻的艾萨克·牛顿，在他的光学研究中，首次为了那个目的使用了它。[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts2a)
    但正如许多事情一样，牛顿是一个例外。牛顿时代的多数科学家，以及随后的一个世纪，他们并没有取平均值。相反，他们从他们的测量值中选择一个“黄金数字”——他们认为这个数字主要是通过直觉认为是最可靠的测量结果。那是因为他们认为测量的变化不是测量过程的必然副产品，而是失败的证据——有时甚至有道德上的后果。事实上，他们很少发表同一数量的多次测量，因为他们觉得这相当于承认了一个失败的过程，并引发信任问题。但在18世纪中叶，潮流开始改变。计算天体的总运动，一系列几乎圆形的椭圆，今天由早熟的高中生在耳机里播放音乐时完成，这是一个简单的任务。但要描述行星运动的细微之处，不仅要考虑太阳的引力，还要考虑其他行星的引力以及行星和月球与完美球形的偏差，即使在今天也是一个困难的问题。为了实现这个目标，复杂的近似数学必须与不完美的观察和测量相协调。

    在那个时期之前，物理学由两个独立的传统组成。一方面，数学科学家研究了牛顿运动和引力理论的精确后果。另一方面，一组有时被称为实验哲学家的人对电、磁、光和热进行了经验研究。实验哲学家——通常是业余爱好者——对科学严格方法的关注不如数学导向的研究者，因此出现了一股改革和数学化实验物理学的运动。在这场运动中，皮埃尔-西蒙·拉普拉斯再次发挥了重要作用。

    such a position would inspire your fellow citizens to invite you into their homes
    for a nice hot cup of gingerbread cappuccino, but when the French Revolution came,
    it proved an especially onerous credential. In 1794, Lavoisier was arrested with
    the rest of the association and quickly sentenced to death. Ever the dedicated
    scientist, he requested time to complete some of his research so that it would
    be available to posterity. To that the presiding judge famously replied, “The

    stick despite the fact that readings from radar guns often vary by several miles
    per hour.[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts5a) And though many students
    (along with their parents) would jump off the roof if doing so would raise their
    598 on the math SAT to a 625, few educators talk about the studies showing that,
    if you want to gain 30 points, there’s a good chance you can do it simply by taking
    the test a couple more times.[⁶](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts6a)
    Sometimes meaningless distinctions even make the news. One recent August the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent.
    In July the bureau had reported the rate at 4.8 percent. The change prompted headlines
    like this one in *The New York Times:* “Jobs and Wages Increased Modestly Last
    Month.”[⁷](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts7a) But as Gene Epstein,
    the economics editor of *Barron’s,* put it, “Merely because the number has changed
    it doesn’t necessarily mean that a thing itself has changed. For example, any
    time the unemployment rate moves by a tenth of a percentage point…that is a change
    that is so small, there is no way to tell whether there really was a change.”[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts8a)
    In other words, if the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the unemployment rate
    in August and then repeats its measurement an hour later, by random error alone
    there is a good chance that the second measurement will differ from the first
    by at least a tenth of a percentage point. Would *The New York Times* then run
    the headline “Jobs and Wages Increased Modestly at 2 P.M.”?

    is the rating of wines. Back in the 1970s the wine business was a sleepy enterprise,
    growing, but mainly in the sales of low-grade jug wines. Then, in 1978, an event
    often credited with the rapid growth of that industry occurred: a lawyer turned
    self-proclaimed wine critic, Robert M. Parker Jr., decided that, in addition to
    his reviews, he would rate wines numerically on a 100-point scale. Over the years
    most other wine publications followed suit. Today annual wine sales in the United
    States exceed $20 billion, and millions of wine aficionados won’t lay their money
    on the counter without first looking to a wine’s rating to support their choice.
    So when *Wine Spectator* awarded, say, the 2004 Valentín Bianchi Argentine cabernet
    sauvignon a 90 rather than an 89, that single extra point translated into a huge
    difference in Valentín Bianchi’s sales.[^(13)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c07-nts13a)
    In fact, if you look in your local wine shop, you’ll find that the sale and bargain
    wines, owing to their lesser appeal, are often the wines rated in the high 80s.
    But what are the chances that the 2004 Valentín Bianchi Argentine cabernet that
    received a 90 would have received an 89 if the rating process had been repeated,
    say, an hour later?'

- en: OF THE THREE PEOPLE instrumental in uncovering the importance of the bell curve,
    its discoverer is the one who least often gets the credit. Abraham De Moivre’s
    breakthrough came in 1733, when he was in his mid-sixties, and wasn’t made public
    until his book *The Doctrine of Chances* came out in its second edition five years
    later. De Moivre was led to the curve while searching for an approximation to
    the numbers that inhabit the regions of Pascal’s triangle far beneath the place
    where I truncated it, hundreds or thousands of lines down. In order to prove his
    version of the law of large numbers, Jakob Bernoulli had had to grapple with certain
    properties of the numbers that appeared in those lines. The numbers can be very
    large—for instance, one coefficient in the 200th row of Pascal’s triangle has
    fifty-nine digits! In Bernoulli’s day, and indeed in the days before computers,
    such numbers were obviously very hard to calculate. That’s why, as I said, Bernoulli
    proved his law of large numbers employing various approximations, which diminished
    the practical usefulness of his result. With his curve, De Moivre was able to
    make far better approximations to the coefficients and therefore greatly improve
    on Bernoulli’s estimates.

- en: 'The approximation De Moivre derived is evident if, as I did for the registration
    cards, you represent the numbers in a row of the triangle by the height of the
    bars on a bar graph. For instance, the three numbers in the third line of the
    triangle are 1, 2, 1\. In their bar graph the first bar rises one unit; the second
    is twice that height; and the third is again just one unit. Now look at the five
    numbers in the fifth line: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1\. That graph will have five bars, again
    starting low, rising to a peak at the center, and then falling off symmetrically.
    The coefficients very far down in the triangle lead to bar graphs with very many
    bars, but they behave in the same manner. The bar graphs in the case of the 10th,
    100th, and 1,000th lines of Pascal’s triangle are shown on chapter 07.'

    the Gaussian distribution (we’ll see later where that term originated). The normal
    distribution is actually not a fixed curve but a family of curves, in which each
    depends on two parameters to set its specific position and shape. The first parameter
    determines where its peak is located, which is at 5, 50, and 500 in the graphs
    on chapter 7\. The second parameter determines the amount of spread in the curve.
    Though it didn’t receive its modern name until 1894, this measure is called the
    standard deviation, and it is the theoretical counterpart of the concept I spoke
    of earlier, the sample standard deviation. Roughly speaking, it is half the width
    of the curve at the point at which the curve is about 60 percent of its maximum
    height. Today the importance of the normal distribution stretches far beyond its
    use as an approximation to the numbers in Pascal’s triangle. It is, in fact, the
    most widespread manner in which data have been found to be distributed.

- en: A good way to get a feeling for how the normal distribution relates to random
    error is to consider the process of polling, or sampling. You may recall the poll
    I described in chapter 5 regarding the popularity of the mayor of Basel. In that
    city a certain fraction of voters approved of the mayor, and a certain fraction
    disapproved. For the sake of simplicity we will now assume each was 50 percent.
    As we saw, there is a chance that those involved in the poll would not reflect
    exactly this 50/50 split. In fact, if *N* voters were questioned, the chances
    that any given number of them would support the mayor are proportional to the
    numbers on line *N* of Pascal’s triangle. And so, according to De Moivre’s work,
    if pollsters poll a large number of voters, the probabilities of different polling
    results can be described by the normal distribution. In other words about 95 percent
    of the time the approval rating they observe in their poll will fall within 2
    standard deviations of the true rating, 50 percent. Pollsters use the term *margin
    of error* to describe this uncertainty. When pollsters tell the media that a poll’s
    margin of error is plus or minus 5 percent, they mean that if they were to repeat
    the poll a large number of times, 19 out of 20 (95 percent) of those times the
    result would be within 5 percent of the correct answer. (Though pollsters rarely
    point this out, that also means, of course, that about 1 time in 20 the result
    will be wildly inaccurate.) As a rule of thumb, a sample of 100 yields a margin
    of error that is too great for most purposes. A sample of 1,000, on the other
    hand, usually yields a margin of error in the ballpark of 3 percent, which for
    most purposes suffices.

  zh: 要了解正态分布如何与随机误差相关联，一个好的方法是考虑民意调查或抽样的过程。你可能还记得我在第5章中描述的关于巴塞尔市市长受欢迎程度的民意调查。在那个城市，一定比例的选民支持市长，而另一部分选民反对。为了简化，我们假设两者都是50%。正如我们所见，参与民意调查的人可能不会完全反映这个50/50的分裂。事实上，如果询问了*N*名选民，那么任何给定数量的选民支持市长的可能性与帕斯卡三角形的第*N*行的数字成正比。因此，根据德莫弗的工作，如果民意调查员对大量选民进行民意调查，不同民意调查结果的概率可以用正态分布来描述。换句话说，大约95%的时间里，他们在民意调查中观察到的支持率将落在真实支持率的2个标准差范围内，即50%。民意调查员使用“误差范围”这个术语来描述这种不确定性。当民意调查员告诉媒体一个民意调查的误差范围是正负5%时，他们的意思是，如果他们多次重复进行民意调查，那么在20次中有19次（95%）的结果将在大约5%的正确答案范围内。（尽管民意调查员很少指出这一点，但这也意味着，当然，大约有1次在20次中结果将非常不准确。）一般来说，100个样本的误差范围对于大多数目的来说太大。另一方面，1000个样本通常会产生大约3%的误差范围，这对于大多数目的来说已经足够了。

    when it is repeated, we should expect the results to vary. For example, if in
    reality 40 percent of registered voters approve of the way the president is handling
    his job, it is much more likely that six independent surveys will report numbers
    like 37, 39, 39, 40, 42, and 42 than it is that all six surveys will agree that
    the president’s support stands at 40 percent. (Those six numbers are in fact the

    “Jobs and Wages Increased Modestly at 2 P.M.,” analogous headlines are common
    in the reporting of political polls. For example, after the Republican National

    to be 2 percentage points…. The percentage of likely voters who said he was their
    choice for president rose from 50 right before the convention to 52 immediately
    afterward.” Only later did the reporter remark that the poll’s margin of error
    was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, which means that the news flash was essentially
    meaningless. Apparently the word *apparently,* in CNN-talk, means “apparently

    when we judge their success at those enterprises, we judge them on just a few
    data points. Should a football team lavish $50 million to lure a guy coming off
    a single record-breaking year? How likely is it that the stockbroker who wants

    bell curve that represents the potentialities that previously existed. We cannot

    we ought to be aware that a sample point is just a sample point, and rather than
    accepting it simply as reality, we ought to see it in the context of the standard
    deviation or the spread of possibilities that produced it. The wine might be rated
    91, but that number is meaningless if we have no estimate of the variation that
    would occur if the identical wine were rated again and again or by someone else.
    It might help to know, for instance, that a few years back, when both *The Penguin
    Good Australian Wine Guide* and On Wine’s *Australian Wine Annual* reviewed the
    1999 vintage of the Mitchelton Blackwood Park Riesling, the *Penguin* guide gave

- en: It was Laplace who plucked the normal distribution from obscurity. He encountered
    Gauss’s work in 1810, soon after he had read a memoir to the Académie des Sciences
    proving a theorem called the central limit theorem, which says that the probability
    that the sum of a large number of independent random factors will take on any
    given value is distributed according to the normal distribution. For example,
    suppose you bake 100 loaves of bread, each time following a recipe that is meant
    to produce a loaf weighing 1,000 grams. By chance you will sometimes add a bit
    more or a bit less flour or milk, or a bit more or less moisture may escape in
    the oven. If in the end each of a myriad of possible causes adds or subtracts
    a few grams, the central limit theorem says that the weight of your loaves will
    vary according to the normal distribution. Upon reading Gauss’s work, Laplace
    immediately realized that he could use it to improve his own and that his work
    could provide a better argument than Gauss’s to support the notion that the normal
    distribution is indeed the error law. Laplace rushed to press a short sequel to
    his memoir on the theorem. Today the central limit theorem and the law of large
    numbers are the two most famous results of the theory of randomness.

  zh: 是拉普拉斯从默默无闻中提炼出了正态分布。他在1810年遇到了高斯的工作，那时他刚刚阅读了一篇提交给科学院的论文，这篇论文证明了被称为中心极限定理的一个定理，该定理指出，大量独立随机因素之和取任何给定值的概率是按照正态分布分布的。例如，假设你烤了100个面包，每次都按照一个旨在生产重1000克的面包的食谱来做。由于偶然，你有时会多加或少加一点面粉或牛奶，或者在烤箱中多蒸发或少蒸发一点水分。如果在最后，无数可能的原因中每一个都增加或减少了几克，中心极限定理表明，你面包的重量将按照正态分布变化。在阅读高斯的工作后，拉普拉斯立刻意识到他可以利用它来改进自己的工作，并且他的工作可以提供一个比高斯更好的论据来支持正态分布确实是误差定律的观点。拉普拉斯急忙出版了他关于该定理的短续篇。如今，中心极限定理和大数定律是随机理论中最著名的两个结果。

    is the correct error law, let’s reconsider Daniel Bernoulli’s example of the archer.
    I played the role of the archer one night after a pleasant interlude of wine and
    adult company, when my younger son, Nicolai, handed me a bow and arrow and dared
    me to shoot an apple off his head. The arrow had a soft foam tip, but still it
    seemed reasonable to conduct an analysis of my possible errors and their likelihood.
    For obvious reasons I was mainly concerned with vertical errors. A simple model
    of the errors is this: Each random factor—say, a sighting error, the effect of
    air currents, and so on—would throw my shot vertically off target, either high
    or low, with equal probability. My total error in aim would then be the sum of
    my errors. If I was lucky, about half the component errors would deflect the arrow
    upward and half downward, and my shot would end up right on target. If I was unlucky
    (or, more to the point, if my son was unlucky), the errors would all fall one
    way and my aim would be far off, either high or low. The relevant question was,
    how likely was it that the errors would cancel each other, or that they would
    add up to their maximum, or that they would take any other value in between? But
    that was just a Bernoulli process—like tossing coins and asking how likely it
    is that the tosses will result in a certain number of heads. The answer is described
    by Pascal’s triangle or, if many trials are involved, by the normal distribution.
    And that, in this case, is precisely what the central limit theorem tells us.
    (As it turned out, I missed both apple and son, but did knock over a glass of
    very nice cabernet.)'

  zh: 为了说明中心极限定理如何解释为什么正态分布是正确的误差定律，让我们重新考虑丹尼尔·伯努利关于射箭者的例子。在一个愉快的酒宴和成年人的陪伴之后，我扮演了射箭者的角色。那天晚上，我的小儿子尼古拉递给我一把弓和一支箭，并挑战我射掉他头上的苹果。箭头有一个软泡沫尖端，但仍然有理由分析我可能出现的误差及其可能性。出于明显的原因，我主要关注垂直误差。误差的简单模型是这样的：每个随机因素——比如瞄准误差、空气流的影响等等——都会使我的射击在垂直方向上偏离目标，要么偏高要么偏低，概率相等。我的瞄准总误差将是这些误差的总和。如果我很幸运，大约一半的误差成分会使箭向上偏移，另一半向下偏移，我的射击最终会正中靶心。如果我不幸（或者更确切地说，如果我的儿子不幸），所有的误差都会向一个方向累积，我的瞄准将偏离很远，要么偏高要么偏低。相关的问题是，误差相互抵消的可能性有多大，或者它们累积到最大值的可能性有多大，或者它们在两者之间取任何其他值的可能性有多大？但这只是一个伯努利过程——就像抛硬币并询问抛掷结果出现特定数量正面的可能性。答案可以用帕斯卡三角形来描述，或者如果涉及许多试验，则可以用正态分布来描述。在这种情况下，这正是中心极限定理告诉我们的。（结果，我既没有射中苹果也没有射中儿子，但撞倒了一杯非常好的卡本内红酒。）
- en: By the 1830s most scientists had come to believe that every measurement is a
    composite, subject to a great number of sources of deviation and hence to the
    error law. The error law and the central limit theorem thus allowed for a new
    and deeper understanding of data and their relation to physical reality. In the
    ensuing century, scholars interested in human society also grasped these ideas
    and found to their surprise that the variation in human characteristics and behavior
    often displays the same pattern as the error in measurement. And so they sought
    to extend the application of the error law from physical science to a new science
    of human affairs.

  zh: 到19世纪30年代，大多数科学家已经相信每一次测量都是一个复合体，受到大量偏差来源的影响，因此受到误差定律的影响。因此，误差定律和中心极限定理使得对数据及其与物理现实的关系有了新的、更深入的理解。在接下来的一个世纪里，对人类社会感兴趣的学者们也掌握了这些思想，并惊讶地发现人类特征和行为的变化往往显示出与测量误差相同的模式。因此，他们试图将误差定律的应用从物理学扩展到一门新的关于人类事务的科学。
