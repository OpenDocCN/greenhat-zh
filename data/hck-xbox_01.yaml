    ten dollars and come with large, unwieldy tips and have no temperature control;
    they just get as hot as they can. Better soldering irons cost more and have a

    the tool’s action more consistent, and extends the life of the tip. Better irons
    also come with a wider selection of tips that may include very fine ones, suitable
    for working with the tiny components found in most electronics today. For light
    use, a quality direct-plug soldering iron with a good tip is sufficient. However,

- en: Solders come in a wide variety. For most purposes, a eutectic Pb-Sn alloy solder
    wire with a no-clean or water-cleanable flux core is sufficient. Eutectic alloys
    are desirable because they go directly from a liquid phase to a homogenous solid.
    Kester is a major manufacturer of solders; their standard cored wire solders,
    Formula 245 and 331, are both pretty good. Formula 245 uses a no-clean flux, but
    if you like, you can use a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol to remove the
    residue. Formula 331 has a flux core that works on more materials than 245\. However,
    with 331 you need to wash down the board with water soon after soldering, or the
    flux residue will become gummy and possibly interfere with circuit operation.
    Many distributors sell Kester solder; for example, Kester 24-6337-8802 (25-gauge
    Formula 245 solder wire in a 1-lb spool) is DigiKey (www.digikey.com) part number
    KE1410-ND. The kind of solder sold at most Radio Shack’s is also quite good for
    soldering, although their solder tends to leave a sticky black residue and require
    cleanup with organic solvents.

  zh: 焊锡种类繁多。对于大多数用途，一种无清洁剂或可水清洁的焊剂芯的共晶Pb-Sn合金焊锡线就足够了。共晶合金是理想的选择，因为它们可以直接从液态转变为均匀的固态。Kester是焊锡的主要制造商；他们的标准焊剂芯线焊锡，245号和331号配方，都相当不错。245号配方使用无清洁剂焊剂，但如果你愿意，可以用一些异丙醇和棉签去除残留物。331号配方具有比245号更广泛适用材料的焊剂芯。然而，使用331号焊锡后，你需要尽快用水清洗电路板，否则焊剂残留物会变得粘稠，并可能干扰电路操作。许多分销商销售Kester焊锡；例如，Kester
    24-6337-8802（25号线的1磅卷装245号焊锡线）是DigiKey（www.digikey.com）的零件号KE1410-ND。大多数Radio
    Shack销售的焊锡也相当适合焊接，尽管他们的焊锡往往会留下粘稠的黑色残留物，需要用有机溶剂进行清洁。

- en: If a solder connection is stubborn to form, flux is the panacea. Always keep
    some flux on hand. When a joint is not forming correctly, a small drop of flux
    applied directly to the joint will typically fix the problem. Flux also comes
    in a wide variety of pastes and liquids, each of which requires a different cleanup
    method. A convenient flux application solution is the flux pen, such as Kester
    83-1000-0951, a Formula 951 no-clean flux pen. You can purchase this flux pen
    from Digi-Key, part number KE1804-ND, for just a few dollars. Radio Shack also
    sells a flux paste in a tube, but their paste is messy and it requires clean-up.
    Finally, desoldering braids are useful for cleaning up any soldering messes or
    mistakes you might make. A desoldering braid is a fine braided copper wire, typically
    laced with dry flux. To use it, place it between the soldering iron and the joint
    you want to clean up; once the braid is hot, the excess solder on the joint will
    wick into the desoldering braid’s capillaries. Even though the braid may be pre-fluxed,
    applying a drop of flux to the braid prior to use still helps the process. Chemtronics
    makes a nice line of desoldering braids; an example part is Chemtronics 60-3-5
    “No-Clean Solder-Wick” (Digi-Key part number 60-3-5-ND).

  zh: 如果焊点难以形成，焊剂就是万能的。始终备有一些焊剂。当焊点无法正确形成时，通常在焊点直接滴上一小滴焊剂就可以解决问题。焊剂也有各种形式的膏状和液体，每种都需要不同的清洁方法。一种方便的焊剂应用解决方案是焊剂笔，例如Kester
    83-1000-0951，一种951无清洁焊剂笔。您可以从Digi-Key购买这种焊剂笔，零件号为KE1804-ND，只需几美元。Radio Shack还出售一种装在管子里的焊剂膏，但他们的膏状物很脏，需要清洁。最后，脱焊线对于清理可能犯的任何焊接错误或混乱非常有用。脱焊线是一种细铜线编织物，通常带有干焊剂。使用时，将其放在烙铁和您想要清理的焊点之间；一旦编织线变热，焊点上的多余焊料就会吸进脱焊线的毛细管中。尽管编织线可能已经预先涂有焊剂，但在使用前在编织线上滴上一滴焊剂仍然有助于这个过程。Chemtronics生产了一系列优质的脱焊线；一个例子是Chemtronics
    60-3-5“无清洁焊料吸管”（Digi-Key零件号60-3-5-ND）。

- en: For basic modification and kit-build projects, DMMs are useful for checking
    for shorted connections, and for checking the basic health of a circuit before
    and after applying power. Continuity mode in a DMM can be helpful when you feel
    like you may have messed up a solder connection. In continuity mode, the DMM will
    emit a tone whenever a low-resistance path exists between the test probes. Thus,
    the continuity feature is useful for both verifying the integrity of a solder
    joint, and for checking for shorts with adjacent connections. You should not use
    continuity mode to check for power supply shorts, because some boards will quite
    normally have a sufficiently low resistance between power and ground (ten ohms
    or so) to trigger the continuity tone. Thus, before applying power to any newly
    modified or built board, use the resistance measuring mode to check and make sure
    that there is no dead short (zero ohms of resistance) on the power lines.

  zh: 对于基本的修改和套件建设项目，数字多用表（DMMs）在检查短路连接以及检查电路在施加电源前后基本健康状况时非常有用。当您感觉可能已经弄错了焊点连接时，DMM的连续性模式可能会有所帮助。在连续性模式下，当测试探针之间存在低电阻路径时，DMM会发出声音。因此，连续性功能对于验证焊点的完整性以及检查相邻连接的短路都很有用。您不应使用连续性模式来检查电源短路，因为一些电路板在电源和地之间可能会有足够低的电阻（大约十欧姆）以触发连续性声音。因此，在向任何新修改或构建的电路板施加电源之前，使用电阻测量模式进行检查并确保电源线上没有死短路（零欧姆的电阻）。

    versatile as an oscilloscope, and is typically more expensive. Oscilloscopes can
    be coaxed into capturing a limited amount of logic data, whereas a logic analyzer
    can never be used to measure an analog waveform. Also, it is easier to build your

    dollars. For PC board design tools, Altium, formerly called Protel, sells a tool
    called CircuitMaker2000\. While I have not used CircuitMaker2000 extensively,
    my first impression is that it is very similar to Altium’s now discontinued Protel
    99SE. Download a free 30-day demo or their free student version (with restrictions),
    which is perfect for a first design project, from http://www.circuitmaker.com.
    Once you’ve designed your first board using your free tool, you can fabricate
    it with a vendor such as Sierra Proto Express (http://www.sierraprotoexpress.com)
    for around 30 dollars per board as of this writing, with a two board minimum order.
    As you can see, price is no longer a serious barrier, and I encourage you to try
    building a project or two using your own custom printed circuit boards.

    99SE。您可以从http://www.circuitmaker.com下载免费的30天试用版或他们的免费学生版（有限制），这对于第一个设计项目来说非常完美。一旦您使用免费工具设计出您的第一块板，您可以使用Sierra
    Proto Express（http://www.sierraprotoexpress.com）等供应商进行制造，每块板大约30美元（截至本文撰写时，最低订单为两块板）。正如您所看到的，价格不再是严重的障碍，我鼓励您尝试使用您自己的定制印刷电路板构建一个或两个项目。

    pry the connector off of the hard drive’s body, as shown in Figure 1-9.

  zh: 接下来，拔掉硬盘的电源连接器。你会发现连接器在硬盘上非常牢固地固定着。如果你直接拉扯连接器，当连接器从驱动器上脱落时，你可能会因为外壳的锐利边缘而受伤。为了避免受伤，使用一把小型的平头螺丝刀轻轻撬开连接器，如图1-9所示。
- en: You can now remove the disk drive assembly entirely. The gray IDE ribbon cable
    will still span the separate drive units; you may remove them if you wish, but
    remember its orientation so you can later re-attach the drives to the Xbox.

  zh: 现在，你可以完全移除磁盘驱动器组件。灰色IDE扁平电缆仍然跨越着独立的驱动器单元；如果你愿意，可以移除它们，但记住其方向，以便稍后可以将驱动器重新连接到Xbox。

- en: Before attaching anything to the Xbox, turn it upside-down and shake it gently
    to ensure that there are no loose screws or parts that you might have accidentally
    dropped into the Xbox. A loose screw will spell the end of your video game console
    and presents a potential fire hazard, so this is a worthwhile check if you have
    any doubt in your mind.

  zh: 在将任何东西连接到Xbox之前，将其倒置并轻轻摇晃以确保没有松动的螺丝或你可能不小心掉入Xbox的部件。松动的螺丝将意味着你的游戏机寿命终结，并且可能存在火灾隐患，所以如果你有任何疑问，这是一个值得检查的步骤。
- en: The first step in reassembling your Xbox is to re-attach the disk drives. If
    you followed the procedure from the previous section, your DVD drive and your
    hard drive should already be attached by the gray IDE ribbon cable. If they are
    not, attach the end of the cable with the fewest creases to the hard drive, and
    then attach the middle connector of the cable to the DVD drive. The cables will
    only attach in one direction; pay attention to the bump on the connector and the
    position of the notch on the drive connectors.

  zh: 重新组装你的Xbox的第一步是重新连接磁盘驱动器。如果你遵循了上一节中的程序，你的DVD驱动器和硬盘驱动器应该已经通过灰色IDE扁平电缆连接好了。如果没有，将电缆上褶皱最少的一端连接到硬盘上，然后将电缆的中间连接器连接到DVD驱动器上。电缆只能按一个方向连接；注意连接器上的凸起和驱动器连接器上的凹槽位置。
- en: Plug the remaining free end of the gray IDE ribbon cable into the Xbox motherboard.
    The cable will only plug into the motherboard in one direction; note the bump
    in the middle of the IDE plug and the notch on the motherboard receptacle. Now,
    attach the yellow DVD cable to the Xbox motherboard. This cable also will plug
    into the motherboard connector in only one orientation, and it too has bumps on
    the cable and corresponding notches on the motherboard receptacle. Now, set the
    DVD drive into the Xbox. Check that it is flush and level by observing how the
    Xbox-logo DVD drive tray sits with respect to the edge of the case. It is likely
    that you will need to try to place the drive a couple of times before it sits
    just right. Use the creases in the gray IDE ribbon cable to help guide you if
    you are confused about the orientation of the various parts.

  zh: 将灰色IDE扁平电缆剩余的自由端插入Xbox的主板。电缆只能按一个方向插入主板；注意IDE插头中间的凸起和主板插座上的凹槽。现在，将黄色DVD电缆连接到Xbox主板。这条电缆也只能按一个方向插入主板连接器，电缆上也有凸起，主板插座上也有相应的凹槽。现在，将DVD驱动器放入Xbox中。通过观察Xbox标志的DVD驱动器托盘相对于外壳边缘的位置来检查它是否平整和水平。你可能需要尝试将驱动器放置几次，直到它放置得恰到好处。如果你对各个部件的方向感到困惑，可以使用灰色IDE扁平电缆的褶皱来帮助引导你。
- en: You’re almost done. Drop the hard drive into place next to the DVD drive. Again,
    this drive will probably require a bit of jiggling about in order to get it to
    settle into place. The drive should be level with the DVD drive and flush with
    the edges of the metal EMI radiation shieldaround the Xbox case. Thread the hard
    drive power cable through its retaining notch in the drive tray, and plug it into
    the hard drive. You will need to apply a fair bit of force on the connector to
    create a solid connection; you should feel a gentle snap when the connector is
    fully engaged. Finally, thread the gray IDE ribbon cable through its original
    retaining hook on the drive carriers.

  zh: 你几乎完成了。将硬盘驱动器放入DVD驱动器旁边的位置。再次提醒，这个驱动器可能需要稍微调整一下，才能使其平稳地放置到位。驱动器应该与DVD驱动器保持水平，并与Xbox外壳周围的金属EMI辐射屏蔽边缘齐平。将硬盘驱动器的电源线穿过驱动器托盘上的固定凹槽，并将其插入硬盘。您需要在连接器上施加相当大的力量以创建牢固的连接；当连接器完全接合时，您应该会感觉到轻微的“咔哒”声。最后，将灰色IDE扁平电缆穿过驱动器支架上的原始固定钩。
- en: At this point, it is a good idea to plug the Xbox in, connect it to a TV and
    check to make sure that the Xbox starts up properly. You can run the Xbox indefinitely
    with the cover off like this, as all of the cooling ducts formed by the bottom
    of the drive carriers and the DVD drive are in place. If the drives are not properly
    connected to the Xbox, the console will still boot, but it wil display a message
    that your console requires service. Check your connections carefully if this message
    appears.

  zh: 到目前为止，插上Xbox、连接到电视并检查Xbox是否能正常启动是个好主意。您可以在不盖盖子的情况下无限期地运行Xbox，因为所有由驱动器支架底部和DVD驱动器形成的冷却通道都已就位。如果驱动器没有正确连接到Xbox，控制台仍然可以启动，但会显示一条消息，说明您的控制台需要服务。如果出现此消息，请仔细检查您的连接。
- en: 'It is now time to screw the drives in place. You should have nine screws at
    this point: three short T10-drive screws for the drive carriers, and six long
    T20-drive screws for the case cover. Don’t panic if you are missing a couple of
    screws, or if you have a couple extra. The Xbox will still hold together even
    if you’re short a screw or two. Attach the screws and the case cover in the reverse
    order of removing them. (See the pictures earlier in this section if you need
    a reminder as to where they go.)'

  zh: 现在是时候将驱动器固定到位了。此时，您应该有九个螺丝：三个短的T10驱动器螺丝用于驱动器支架，以及六个长的T20驱动器螺丝用于外壳盖。如果您丢失了几颗螺丝，或者多了几颗，请不要慌张。即使缺少一两颗螺丝，Xbox仍然可以保持在一起。按照拆卸它们的相反顺序安装螺丝和外壳盖。（如果您需要提醒它们的位置，请参考本节前面的图片。）
