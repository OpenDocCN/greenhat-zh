<i class="calibre11">Setting Up and Using Your Printer</i>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Unless the only thing you use your  computer for is playing games, listening  to MP3s, or stopping doors on hot, windy  days, you will no doubt want to hook up your  machine to a printer. It just seems to be one of  those innate characteristics of human beings that makes  us want to see our words in print. If print you must, and  print you want, then print you shall . . . </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Setting up a printer to work with your new system is a pretty easy task, but you do have  to make sure that your printer is supported. Fortunately, it seems that printer support  in the Linux world is getting much, much better than it once was. In general, support  for Epson and Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers is pretty good, while support for other  makers and other printer types is a bit spottier. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you really want to make sure whether or not your printer is supported  (and why wouldn’t you?), the best thing to do is probably to go to <a target="_top" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org">www.linuxprinting.org.</a> On that site, you can check out the online database to see  if your printer is currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for  supported printers also include information on what drivers are best for your  purposes. If you’re thinking of buying a printer, there is also a page of suggested  makes and models.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get started, you will have to turn your computer off, connect your printer to  the computer, turn on the printer, and then restart your computer. Of course, if  your printer was connected and on during installation, you can skip this step.  Either way, if your printer is supported, the system will find it and automatically  configure it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Sometimes, things can be a tad less automatic: When your system starts up, it  will, upon finding your printer, shoot up a blue and red Kudzu (hardwareprobing utility) screen, which will tell you that it has found some new hardware.  On that screen, you then press any key to proceed, and on the following screen  you tell it to configure your printer by hitting ENTER. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">That’s it, as far as printer hardware goes. After that, you still might have to  set it up so that the operating system knows how to communicate with that  particular printer. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To see whether or not you will have to do this, go to the GNOME Panel and  click the GNOME Print Manager icon (the one that looks like a printer). If a  printer icon appears in the window that pops up, you are all set. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If not, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the GNOME Main menu, select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Printing</b>. You will be  prompted for your root password, so type it in and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. After  doing this, the Printer Configuration window (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU67">Figure 6-1</a>) will appear, and it will be as empty as my head in the early morning.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that your printer is set up, you will no doubt want to start printing. This is an  easy task and not much different how it works in the Windows and Mac worlds, so  you will need little explanation in this regard. There is, however, one simple  point that might confuse you at first, so I’ll cover it now.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you first print from OpenOffice or other programs, you will notice  that the print dialog box will have <b class="calibre13">Generic Printer</b>, <b class="calibre13">Default</b>, or <b class="calibre13">Postscript/ Default </b>listed as the selected printer. The print queue you created just moments  ago is the default printer, so any of those more generic selections also refer to  your printer. However, if you prefer seeing the name of your printer listed, as I  prefer seeing my Hewie, click the button at the right edge of the drop-down  menu next to the word <b class="calibre13">Name </b>in the print dialog box, and you will find your  printer by name. Again, it doesn’t matter which of these printers you select, as they are all one and the same.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While you were looking at the print dialog box discussed in the <a href="DDU0049.html#286" target="_parent">previous section</a>,  you may have noticed that there was another choice in the list: <b class="calibre13">PDF Converter</b>.  When you are printing from other programs, it might be listed as <b class="calibre13">Print to PDF</b> or  something to that effect, but the purpose is the same: You can save your  document as a PDF file. You probably have read documents in PDF format, so  you most likely know what they are, but now you can create them too.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is very handy, as it allows you to create documents that cannot be  altered by others and yet can easily be read regardless of what word processor program or computer platform another person is using. It also makes for smaller  files that can more easily and quickly be sent as email attachments. <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a> of  this book, for example, was a 5.5MB OpenOffice document, but when I printed it  to PDF, it became a 770KB PDF file.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you print various things, it is inevitable that, for some reason or another, you  will want to change your printer settings. For example, let’s say that you are  running low on color ink and want to keep everything in black or shades of gray  for a while. Or maybe you want to print a particular photo at a higher resolution  than the default resolution setting of your current printer driver. Doing all this is  pretty easy, and there are a couple of methods — one very temporary and the  other a little more permanent. <a name="291" id="291"/><a name="IDX-93" id="IDX-93"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s say you want to print an OpenOffice document that contains a variety of  colors, but you want to print it out in grayscale. Just go to the <b class="calibre13">File</b> menu and  select <b class="calibre13">Print </b>as you normally would. When the Print dialog box opens, click the  <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> button. After the Properties window appears, click the <b class="calibre13">Device</b> tab, and  from the <b class="calibre13">Color</b> drop-down menu select <b class="calibre13">Grayscale </b>(see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU71">Figure 6-5</a>). Once you’ve  done that, just click<b class="calibre13"> OK</b> to close the Properties window, and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b> to  print the document. These settings will remain until you have finished and  closed the document that you are printing. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The second method of changing printer settings is best used if the first method  does not work for you, if you are going to be preparing a lot of documents that  require the identical setting changes, or if you want to make changes to the  resolution setting. This method is also pretty easy, though it may be a bit more  indirect than you are used to. Just go to your Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">System  Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Printing</b>. You will be prompted for your root password, so type it in and  click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. After doing this, you will see the Printer Configuration window. Click  the name of your printer, and then click the <b class="calibre13">Edit</b> button. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the Edit a Print Queue window appears, click the <b class="calibre13">Driver Options</b> tab and you will see a screen very much like that in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU72">Figure 6-6</a>, though yours might be  slightly different depending on the make and model of your printer.<a name="295" id="295"/><a name="IDX-94" id="IDX-94"/>

<a name="298" id="298"/><a name="IDX-95" id="IDX-95"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Well, changing the printer settings was all easy enough, but if you have to make  changes like this often, you will end up getting pretty annoyed. Let’s say that you  make changes of this sort often because you write up a lot of black and white  draft documents that you only need to print at a 300 dpi resolution, but once you  are done fixing them up, you want to print and send them to other people at a  higher quality, such as 600 dpi. And when you aren’t writing up business  documents, you love to print out high-quality photos that you took on your  digital camera, but before printing out the final version, you like to preview them  at a lower, and faster-printing, resolution. Satisfying all these needs would  require a lot of trips to the Edit window, and that just will not do.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is where having multiple print queues comes in handy. Although you  have only one printer, you can create a variety of print queues, each with its own  set of driver preferences. These function like a series of virtual printers, from  which you can freely choose. The original queue you created is most likely a 300  dpi, color and B/W cartridge, letter-page-size setup. You can, however, add other  queues that have different configurations in terms of color choice, print  resolution, and even paper size.<a name="299" id="299"/><a name="IDX-96" id="IDX-96"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To show you how this is done, I will use myself as an example. Let’s say that I  am satisfied with my 300 dpi, color and B/W setup, but I also often print out  high-quality color photos. I will create a new queue for that purpose. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Just as you did when you created your original queue, I will go to the  GNOME Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Printing</b>. Now when the Printer  Configuration window opens, I will click the <b class="calibre13">New</b> button, and I will go through  the wizard pages, this time naming my queue <span>Color1200</span> (no spaces are allowed in  the name). In the Comments box I write: <span>High quality color printing and cocktails</span>. Then I go through the remaining wizard steps, as before, until I am  done and back at the Printer Configuration window.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I can now see my original Hewie, and there below it is my new Color_1200. The next thing I have to do is change my driver settings for the new queue, so I  select Color_1200 by clicking it, and then I click the <b class="calibre13">Edit</b> button. In the Edit  window, I click the <b class="calibre13">Driver Options</b> tab and then in the <b class="calibre13">Resolution, Quality, Ink  Type, Media Type</b> drop-down menu, I select <b class="calibre13">1200 dpi, Photo, Black + Color  Cartridge</b> and then click the <b class="calibre13">OK</b> button. To apply my new changes, I click the  <b class="calibre13">Apply</b> button and I am done.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Because I sometimes prefer to create documents in grayscale only, I will create yet another queue called Grayscale300 and follow the same steps, except  for the Comments box (where I will enter <span>General grayscale printing</span>) and the  selection of the driver options.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that I’m all done with that, I think I should change the name of my original Hewie so that I won’t get confused in the future. To do this, I click  <b class="calibre13">Hewie</b> in the Printer Configuration window and then click <b class="calibre13">Edit</b>. In the Edit  window, I change Hewie’s name to <span>Color300</span>, and in the Comment box I write: <span>General color printing</span>. Then I click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and back in the Printer Configuration  window I click the <b class="calibre13">Apply</b> button to apply my changes. That is all there is to it. My Printer Configuration window now looks like the one in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU73">Figure 6-7</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, if you decide to take an approach similar to this, make sure you exit  from and restart any program you were in when you made the changes, or your  new print queues will not show up within the Print dialog box for that program.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that I have all these print queues, you might be wondering how I can switch  among them when printing. If I am switching a lot, it is probably easiest to just  select the queue I want to use from the print dialog box of a program like  OpenOffice. If, however, I am going to print several documents in succession  requiring the same queue, I might just want to make that queue the default  printer, if it is not already.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Changing the default printer is a no-sweat operation. There are a couple of  ways to do it, but I will tell you the easiest one. Once you create a few queues of  your own, all you need to do is open the Print Manager by clicking the printer  icon in the left portion of the GNOME Panel. When you do this, you will be able  to see your print queues, each shown in the form of a printer icon in the  GNOME Print Manager window. In my case, my present default is Color300, but  I am going to change the default to Gray300. To do this, I simply right-click  <b class="calibre13">Gray300</b> and select <b class="calibre13">Set as Default</b> in the pop-up menu. Gray300 now has a check  mark on it to indicate that it is the default print queue, as you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU74">Figure 6-8</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The approach you take to printer queues depends on you and your needs. You  might not need anything more than a single print queue, but at least you now  know how it all can be done. Whatever you eventually choose to do, you needn’t  worry at every point along the way, because you can undo anything you have  done in one way or another. Just have fun with it. Feel empowered. Move on.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It happens to all of us. You wanted to print just 1 page of a 57-page document,  but by accident you started printing the whole thing. What can you do to save  your ink and 56 sheets of paper? Fortunately, the solution is simple. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve clicked the <b class="calibre13">Print</b> button and the print job is sent to your  printer, a small printer icon will appear at the right end of your GNOME Panel, as you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU75">Figure 6-9</a> on the next page.<a name="304" id="304"/><a name="IDX-97" id="IDX-97"/>

<span><span>Figure 6-9: </span> A print queue icon in the GNOME Panel</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Just click that icon once, and two windows will appear: a GNOME Print Manager  window, which shows what print queues you have created, and a window for your  current print jobs (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU76">Figure 6-10</a>). Your errant print job will be listed in  that window, so click the name of the job to select it, and then, in the <b class="calibre13">Edit</b> menu,  select <b class="calibre13">Cancel Documents</b>.<a name="306" id="306"/><a name="IDX-98" id="IDX-98"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After you do this, the print job listed in the queue window will disappear, and  your printer will stop printing. You can then close the Print Manager and the  print queue windows. This is a very easy process that you may well find is more  effective than what you’ve experienced in other operating systems.</p>
