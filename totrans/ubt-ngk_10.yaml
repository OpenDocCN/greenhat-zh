    only makes sense, because it is those two tools that turn a web-surfing, game-playing,
    music-churning, number-crunching box of chips into a meaningful production tool—a
    virtual publishing house, if you will. These two tools help your computer convert
    digital information into hard copy (in the case of printers) and convert hard
    copy into digital information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising,
    therefore, that these tools often come together these days in the form of multifunction
    printers.

    On that site, you can check out the online database to see whether your printer
    is currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers
    also include information on what drivers are best for your purposes. There is
    also a page of suggested makes and models, in case you're considering buying a
    printer with the intent of using it with your Linux system. Read this before making
    your purchase decision. You might also want to consult Ubuntu's list at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/).

- en: Printer handling in Ubuntu is pretty much a no-brainer, because Ubuntu automatically
    detects most printers. If you have a USB printer, connect it to your computer,
    and then power up the printer (vice versa should work just fine, too). Assuming
    Ubuntu recognizes your printer, and chances are it will, a small printer icon
    will appear in the upper-right panel while the system goes through its automatic
    setup routine. When it is done, a small notification bubble like the one in [Figure 10-1](ch10.html#ubuntu_lets_you_know_it_has_automaticall
    "Figure 10-1. Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured
    your printer.") will appear, telling you that your printer has been recognized.
    There is nothing more for you to do in this case—your printer is set up and ready
    to roll.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also possible, however, that Ubuntu will recognize your printer but not
    find a driver that is an exact match for it. In this case, it will offer a substitute
    driver, and the autorecognition window will look slightly different from the one
    in [Figure 10-1](ch10.html#ubuntu_lets_you_know_it_has_automaticall "Figure 10-1. Ubuntu
    lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured your printer.").

    your printer in the Printing window that appears. A Printer Properties window

    close the Printer Properties and Printing windows.

    you might still be able to access ink levels and maintenance functions using the
    manufacturer's own Linux driver, if one exists. Also, some newer printers allow
    you to check ink levels and align and clean cartridges using controls on the printer.
    When in doubt, check your printer's manual.

    them in Linux is still a bit spotty. Fortunately, this is changing for the better
    with every new Linux release. The backend—the hidden part of your system that
    handles scanner recognition and support in Linux—is called *Sane*. If you are
    wondering whether Linux will be able to recognize your scanner or if you are trying
    to figure out what type of scanner to buy, you can visit the Sane website at [http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html/](http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html/).

    it certainly lives up to its name—it doesn't take many clicks to get a document
    from scanner bed to computer screen. To run Simple Scan, make sure that your scanner
    is connected and switched on, and then select **Applications** ▸ **Graphics**
    ▸ **Simple Scan**. If you get a warning saying that no scanners were detected,
    skip to [Unrecognized Scanners](ch10s02.html#unrecognized_scanners "Unrecognized
    Scanners") in [Unrecognized Scanners](ch10s02.html#unrecognized_scanners "Unrecognized

    and, after a short wait, you'll be presented with a preview of the picture or
    document you placed on the scanner. You can crop and rotate the image by using
    the options in the Page menu or by right-clicking the preview. When you're happy

    some particularly complex scanning that you need to do, you can use XSane. XSane
    is a real monster of a scanning program, packed full of professional features
    and fine-tuning options (see [Figure 10-12](ch10s02.html#scanning_with_xsane "Figure 10-12. Scanning

    will perform a search for an attached scanner. If it finds one, it will start
    up. If it doesn't, a window will appear that says "No devices available." If this
    happens, click the **Close** button, and skip to [Unrecognized Scanners](ch10s02.html#unrecognized_scanners

    text the image contains by recognizing the shapes of individual letters. (It only
    works for typed text, not handwriting.)

    click the second button from the left (the one that says **ABCDEF**) before you
    click **Save image**, and you will find that you can save the file as a text document
    now as well. The text recognition isn't perfect, so make sure you go over the
    text file to look for typos afterward.

- en: 'To wrap up this section on scanning, let me address a question that seems to
    confuse a lot of people: Why does a scanned image on the computer screen seem
    so much bigger than its real-life counterpart? One of the first areas of confusion
    is that there is a general blurring of how the terms *pixels per inch (ppi)* and
    *dots per inch (dpi)* are used. Most applications use these terms interchangeably,
    and yet they aren''t really the same thing. To make things simple, when you are
    talking about images on your screen, you are talking about *pixels* (the little
    squares that make up your screen image) per inch, and when you are talking about
    printer resolution, you are talking about *dots* (of printer ink) per inch.'

- en: Your computer screen generally has a resolution of 96ppi, while most modern
    inkjet and laser printers have a resolution range of 300 to 1200dpi, or sometimes
    even more. This means that a photo scanned at 96ppi, which looks just fine on
    your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it. On the other hand,
    when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will look much better in your printout
    but will be gigantic if you display it "full size" on your screen. This is because
    there will be three times as many pixels per inch, so it looks three times bigger
    onscreen.

    First, there are the limitations of your scanner, since different models have
    different maximum resolutions. The resolution limits of your printer are also,
    naturally enough, a major consideration. For example, laser printers and inkjet
    printers have different characteristics; laser printers will generally produce
    better-quality images than inkjet printers, while inkjet output will be more greatly
    affected by the type of paper used than a laser printer will be. Of course, your
    printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images at higher resolutions
    than those at which you plan to print them, but you will end up with a lot of
    files taking up too much disk space. Remember, *the higher the resolution of a
    scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk space*. If this is of
    concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you''re done printing using
    an application such as the GIMP (more on that in [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. BRUSH-WIELDING
    PENGUINS")), but if you would prefer not being so cavalier with your use of disk
    space from the get-go, you can follow these very general guidelines:'

    and, most importantly, don't wait until you desperately need to scan something
    before trying things—stay ahead of the game.
