    from any legacy medium—vinyl LPs, cassette tapes, reel-to-reel tapes,
    vintage 78s, videocassettes, even eight-track tapes—to CD. Or you can
    transfer them to a hard drive, solid-state drive, or whatever digital
    storage medium you prefer.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Transferring phonograph records to CD is in demand, and you might
    even be able to get a nice sideline going doing this. A lot of people are
    still hanging on to their record collections but are afraid to enjoy them
    because LPs are fragile. A lot of great albums have never been released on
    commercial CDs, or the modern CD remasters are not done well. Some people
    simply prefer the sound of their old records.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although you can copy any analog media and convert it to any digital
    audio format, in this chapter we’ll talk mostly about transferring vinyl
    record albums and singles to CDs. Once you have converted your old analog
    media to a digital format, Audacity has a number of tools for cleaning up
    the sound quality. You may not always be able to perform perfect
    restorations, but you can reduce hiss, clicks, pops, and other defects to
    quite tolerable levels.</p><p>You can also customize dynamic range compression to suit your own
    needs, which is a nice thing because on modern popular CDs, dynamic range
    compression is abused to where it spoils the music. Even if they did it
    well, it might not be right for you, so Audacity lets you do it your
    way.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Finally, we’ll discuss the merits of vinyl versus CD and other
    media, as well as the ins and out of connecting your various playback
    devices to your computer. If you need help setting up your hardware, skip

    first.</p><p>For those of you with golden ears who are not satisfied with 16/44.1
    CDs, the DVD-Audio format supports up to 24/196. That’s right, 24 bits at
    196,000 samples per second. DVD-Audio supports 5.1 surround sound, and so
    does Audacity in the 1.3.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> releases. If you’re not
    into surround sound, you can cram several CDs worth of music at 16/44.1
    onto a DVD. We’ll learn about authoring DVD-Audio disks in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Authoring Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs">Chapter 6</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Okay then, let’s dive into copying, editing, and then making CDs.
    Please review <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> if you need
    a refresher on the basics of using Audacity.</p><div class="sect1" title="Preparing Vinyl LPs for Copying"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="preparing_vinyl_lps_for_copying"/>Preparing Vinyl LPs for Copying</h1></div></div></div><p>First, clean up your vinyl records as well as you can. Sure, you
      can do a lot to clean up digital audio files, but it’s not like on TV
      where the ace lab tech makes pristine restorations effortlessly. That’s
      fiction, my dear readers, and we are stuck in the real world. It’s
      better to start with the best-quality recording possible; it’s less
      work, and you get better results.</p><p>I have my nice old Discwasher brushes from the olden days, and
      it’s a good thing because the new ones are inferior. Real Discwasher
      brushes have a directional nap—hold them one way to clean the record,
      and then reverse your stroke on a clean lint-free cloth to clean the
      brush. There is an arrow embedded on the handle that points to the
      leading edge. You can use a real Discwasher brush dry or with a wet
      cleaning solution. The correct way to wet-clean with Discwasher is to
      apply the cleaning solution to the leading edge of the brush only,
      leaving the rest of it dry. You can clean a record on your turntable
      while it’s rotating, but be careful you don’t apply so much pressure
      that you damage the motor. Apply the wet leading edge of the brush for
      three to four turns, and then roll the brush to bring the dry part in
      contact with the record for another three to four turns. Give it time to
      dry completely before playing it, because playing a wet record can
      damage it. (However, on a record that is already in bad, nothing-to-lose
      condition, playing it wet might make it sound better. Moisten it
      carefully with distilled water or Discwasher D4 fluid, and give it a
      whirl. It won’t hurt your stylus.)<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A nice thing to have for everyday cleaning is a carbon antistatic
      brush. These are always used dry and are pretty good at lifting out
      dust, lint, and other particles that try to make a home on your records.
      But they’re no good for cleaning fingerprints, sticky goo, or other muck
      that requires a wet cleaner.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0013" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are all kinds of cleaning solutions, microfiber cloths,
      brushes, and even wet power washers. The debates over the best ways to
      clean vinyl records are endless and loud; I shall leave it to you to do
      your own homework and figure out what you prefer. You can pick up nasty,
      dirty, nothing-to-lose records to practice on at thrift shops for cheap.
      Given the variety of claims over what works best, I suspect that vinyl
      is tougher than we give it credit for.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="the_history_of_record_production"/><p class="title">The History of Record Production</p><p>The earliest recordings were made on rotating wax cylinders with
        a needle in the middle of a vibrating diaphragm attached to a horn,
        like an old-fashioned ear trumpet. The horn functioned like a
        microphone. The needle vibrations cut an uneven groove into the wax.
        Modern mono recordings were made using the same principle of a
        vibrating needle cutting into a softer material, except the needle was
        moved by a magnet.</p><p>Stereo came about when someone experimented with the angle of
        the magnet with respect to the needle and found that it could be
        controlled precisely enough to cut each side of the groove
        differently, creating two stereo channels. The technology for
        producing vinyl records, even with the advent of CDs and digital
        audio, has continued to improve, and some record labels are still
        producing high-quality vinyl recordings. With all of these advances,
        it’s still a single needle doing the recording and playback for two
        channels, which results in a bit of <span class="emphasis"><em>crosstalk</em></span>, so
        precision tuning of your turntable is required to get the best
        performance.</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Never use any kind of alcohol on vintage 78 rpm records or any
        acetate or nonvinyl records because it will damage them. The earliest
        records were made of wax, and there were many different wax
        compositions using carnuba, beeswax, and other materials. People who
        know about these things recommend not using liquid cleaners at all. If
        you have vintage records, I recommend consulting experts who know how
        to handle them safely. Solutions containing alcohol are fine for
        modern vinyl records, and most record cleaners contain alcohol.
        Whatever cleaner you use, it must be something that leaves no
        residue.</p></div><p>You should also invest in a stylus brush and cleaner, because gunk
      builds up on your stylus. This is less controversial; I use the Stanton
      SC-4 brush and cleaner, and they do the job just fine. Remember, you
      cannot be too careful when you’re handling your turntable’s stylus;
      handle it as gently as you possibly can by its mounting brace only.
      Never touch it with your fingers.</p><p>Use a stylus gauge to adjust the vertical tracking force of your
      stylus. High-quality cartridges require a mere 0.5 to 3 grams.
      Medium-quality styli, and those designed for DJs, go as high as 5 grams.
      Set the tracking force per the instructions for your particular
      hardware. Too light and too heavy will both cause too much wear, so you
      really want it just right.</p><p>Depending on your turntable and tonearm, you may also have
      antiskate, vertical tracking angle, and azimuth adjustments. Your
      turntable documentation should tell you all about what these are and how
      to adjust them. The idea is to make correctly aligned contact without
      causing asymmetrical wear. It is worth spending some time tuning your
      turntable, and you may be surprised at how much difference tiny
      adjustments make.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0020" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>

These are
      the steps to follow:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Set Audacity’s frame rate to CDDA frames in the Selection

      some tips for common fixes, and <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Fix-its and Cleanups">Chapter 12</a>
      is devoted entirely to fix-its and cleanups.</p><p>I like to record singles a little differently than in step 3: I
      prefer to record each single into its own track, so it looks like <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#putting_each_song_into_a_separate_audaci" title="Figure 3-1. Putting each song into a separate Audacity track">Figure 3-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="putting_each_song_into_a_separate_audaci"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e4279"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797479.png.jpg" alt="Putting each song into a separate Audacity track"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-1. Putting each song into a separate Audacity track</p></div><p>Use the Track menu on each track to enter the song titles as the
      track names. At export, when all the tracks are exported to CD-ready
      files, each file will take the track name.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0023" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The advantage of using individual Audacity tracks per single is
      it’s easier to reorder them, and you can normalize volume levels in one
      operation. When all the songs are in one track, normalization won’t
      bring the quiet songs up to the same volume as the loud songs. Any
      variances have to be corrected one song at a time. But when multiple
      tracks are normalized, all of them are brought up to the same volume
      level in one step.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Audacity Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="audacity_settings"/>Audacity Settings</h1></div></div></div><p>First, set the correct frame rate for CD audio in the Selection
      toolbar, as <a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#setting_the_correct_frame_rate_for_cd_au" title="Figure 3-2. Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio">Figure 3-2</a>
      shows. This ensures that any splits you make will start and end on a CD
      frame. Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and
      possibly create clicking noises. You can choose either hh:mm:ss + CDDA
      frames (75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time plus
      CD frames, and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To”
      box to ensure that stops and starts are always on the CD frame
      boundaries.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="setting_the_correct_frame_rate_for_cd_au"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e4323"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797481.png.jpg" alt="Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-2. Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio</p></div><p>Then set your quality preferences in the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit&gt;Preferences &gt;Quality</strong></span> dialog to a
      sample rate of 44,100 Hz and a bit depth of 32-bit float. The Red Book
      CD Audio standard is 16/44.1, but if you have enough disk space, working
      in 32-bit float has a number of advantages. It gives you the largest
      possible dynamic range, which means less noise and a lot of headroom for
      editing, so you can do a lot of processing with losing
      quality.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0027" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Recording at 16/44.1 works fine if you want to conserve disk
      space, especially if you’re doing straight copying with minimal editing.
      The more manipulation you do, the better it is to work in 32-bit
      float.</p><p>While you’re in the Preferences menu, review these options as
      well:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>On the Recording tab, uncheck “Overdub: Play other tracks
          while re-cording new one” and “Software Playthrough: Listen while
          recording or montoring new track.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On the Import/Export tab, check “Show Metadata Editor prior to
          export.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure the number of recording channels is set correctly
          (Devices tab), which is two-channel stereo. Even old mono LPs use
          two tracks.</p></li></ul></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Recording"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="recording"/>Recording</h1></div></div></div><p>Then click <span class="strong"><strong>File &gt; Save Project
      As</strong></span> and give your project a name, start your record player,
      and set your recording levels. You have plenty of headroom, so give
      yourself some space to avoid clipping. Using a 32-bit float bit depth
      means you can record to a peak of -24 dB and still have more dynamic
      range than your hardware can use; I usually record to a peak of -9 dB
      because a record is not unpredictable like a live show. If it surprises
      me with a sudden super-loud passage, I can easily re-record it. Click
      <span class="strong"><strong>View &gt; Show Clipping</strong></span>, and Audacity
      will highlight any clipping with a bright red line.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0042" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0043" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0046" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Record</strong></span> button
      and start playing your record. There’s nothing much to do except kick
      back and enjoy the music until it’s time to flip to side two. Click the
      <span class="strong"><strong>Pause</strong></span> button to pause recording while
      you flip the record. Every time you click <span class="strong"><strong>Record</strong></span>, it starts a new track, so use <span class="strong"><strong>Pause</strong></span> to keep going on the same track. If you
      accidentally hit <span class="strong"><strong>Stop</strong></span> instead, you
      can append to your existing track with <span class="keycap">shift</span>-Record.</p><p>It is a good idea to record some noise, like at the beginning of
      the record before the music starts and at the end after the music stops,
      so you can do some effective noise removal later. A pure noise sample
      with no music in it is best. Save this in a separate track.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Fixing Defects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fixing_defects"/>Fixing Defects</h1></div></div></div><p>First do a rough trim to delete any unwanted sections. Don’t cut
      too closely but leave some extra, and then apply the finishing touches
      later. Trimming away unwanted sections of your tracks is easy; just
      select the parts you don’t want and press the <span class="keycap">delete</span> key, or click the <span class="strong"><strong>Cut</strong></span> button. Another way to do deletions is to
      select what you want to keep and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Trim</strong></span> button. This keeps your selection and
      deletes the rest.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0048" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Deleting part of a track makes it shorter, and sometimes you might
      not want to do this but rather keep it the same length. Do this by
      silencing instead of deleting—select the part you want to get rid of and
      click the <span class="strong"><strong>Silence</strong></span> button. This makes
      it silent instead of removing it, and your track stays the same
      length.</p><p>The next step is to fix any clipping or scratches. It is common
      for defects to be in only one channel. This is more characteristic of
      vinyl because the needle is pushed by the groove, so the side pushing
      the needle inward gets more wear. Tapes will also wear unevenly because
      one track is on the “inside” away from the edge of the tape. The track
      closest to the edge will be affected the most by magnetism, electrical
      fields, and physical damage from the tape guides.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0049" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The definition of <span class="emphasis"><em>track</em></span> is a bit squishy.
        An audio track is a single mono track or a two-channel stereo track,
        or it’s a single song on a long track with multiple songs.</p></div><p>To fix a defect in only one channel, use the <span class="strong"><strong>Split Stereo Track</strong></span> command in the Track panel
      to break your stereo track into two separate tracks. Then you can edit
      each one separately, and when you’re finished, you can use <span class="strong"><strong>Make Stereo Track</strong></span> to put them back together. A
      nice benefit of dividing them is that the undamaged track will mask
      less-than-perfect repairs in the other track.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0055" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Did you know you can insert silence?

        track a warped record more accurately than a low-budget turntable.
        Many how-tos suggest flattening the warp by carefully warming the
        record to soften it—in an oven, in a sunny window, in a warm
        vehicle—and then placing it inside a clean paper sleeve and putting it
        under a heavy weight. I have tried the warm vehicle method because the
        idea of using an oven scares me, and sometimes it works well if you
        are careful and finicky about keeping everything clean. Pressing
        debris into the soft, warm vinyl won’t improve it any.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0059" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can use Audacity to mitigate some of the bad sounds created

        without removing music. It looks for spikes in the waveform that are
        typical of the pops caused by scratches, deletes the scratches, and
        then does a bit of interpolation to reconstruct the waveform. The
        Select threshold setting determines the sensitivity for deciding when
        a spike is a scratch. Smaller Select threshold values are more
        sensitive, and larger values are less sensitive. Too much sensitivity
        means something you want to keep might be identified as a click and
        removed, such as some percussion effects.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0062" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_area_to_the_left_of_the_cursor_line"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e4650"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797487.png.jpg" alt="The area to the left of the cursor line is between songs and should be relatively flat, but this example is from a record with a lot of little scratches, so you see many sudden, slender peaks instead."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-5. The area to the left of the cursor line is between songs and

        to quickly find any clipped segments. Clipping is caused when the
        volume of your recording goes over 0 dB. Clipping is nasty in digital
        audio because it causes distortion. An easy way to fix a brief clipped
        segment is with the Amplify effect. Zoom in and carefully select the
        clipped segment, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect &gt;
        Amplify</strong></span> to bring it down a notch or two. Use a negative
        value for the Amplification setting, such as -3.0. One decibel is
        about the smallest level of change we can perceive, and every 3
        decibels doubles or, when reducing amplitude, halves the volume level.
        So -3 dB is half as loud as 0 dB, and -6 dB is half as loud as -3 dB.
        Clipped passages over a few seconds long should be
        rerecorded.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0077" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Noise Removal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="noise_removal"/>Noise Removal</h2></div></div></div><p>Vinyl LPs, on even the finest systems, are never completely
        silent. There is always some sort of background noise: hiss, turntable
        rumble, tiny scratchy noises from static electricity or pressing
        defects in the vinyl. Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Effect &gt;
        Noise Removal</strong></span> effect to get rid of this unwanted noise.
        It’s not perfect, and there is always a trade-off between removing
        noise without causing too much damage to the music. It works best when
        you have a good noise profile and the noise is distinctly different
        from what you want to keep.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0079" class="indexterm"/></p><p>First you need to build a profile of the noise you want to
        remove, so select a few seconds of your track that has only noise,
        such as the very beginning or very end where the stylus is traveling
        over the record but not over the music. The longer your noise sample,
        the better, from 5 seconds up to 30 seconds or so. Select your noise
        sample, and then in the <span class="strong"><strong>Effect &gt; Noise
        Removal</strong></span> dialog, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Get Noise
        Profile</strong></span> button. Next, select the segment that you want to
        apply noise removal to and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. You can use the Preview button to make
        sure it’s doing it right before hitting OK. Apply Noise Removal as
        precisely as you can to minimize side effects. Hiss, wow and flutter,
        hum, and low-level scratchiness are all common defects, and the Noise
        Removal tool works well if you have a good clean noise
        sample.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0080" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0081" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0082" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0083" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0084" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you don’t like the results, press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-Z to undo, change some settings, and try
        it again. The default noise reduction level is -24 dB, which means
        segments identified as noise are attenuated by -24 dB. If this removes
        too much of the recording, reduce this and try it again. A similar
        tactic that often works well is to go back to your noise sample,
        reduce its amplitude a few dB, create a new profile, and try again.
        You don’t want to erase the noise completely because this may erase
        things you want to keep, just lower it to where it’s not
        bothersome.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0085" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Frequency smoothing and Attack/decay time sliders are more
        aggressive when you move them left and less aggressive on the right
        sides of the scales. A larger value for frequency smoothing means it
        treats a wider range of frequencies as the same, so it makes larger
        changes. <span class="emphasis"><em>Attack</em></span> is how hard a note is hit, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>decay</em></span> is how long it takes to fade away. Since
        there is only one Attack/decay time slider, the attack and decay times
        will always be the same. Smaller values are more abrupt, and larger
        values are more gradual.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0086" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0087" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0088" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another slick trick is to use the Equalization effect (see <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects">Chapter 11</a> to learn more) to
        reduce hiss or rumble by reducing the amplitude of frequencies below
        500 Hz and above 15,000 Hz. Of course, this will also affect any
        sounds in this range that you want to keep, so it’s not always the
        best solution, but it is one more thing to try. You can try this in
        any part of the frequency range that contains unwanted
        noise.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0089" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another way to limit a range of frequencies is to use a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>high-pass</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>low-pass</em></span>
        filter. A high-pass filter blocks low frequencies and allows high
        frequencies to pass, while a low-pass filter blocks high frequencies.
        You may need to install some plug-ins to get high- and low-pass
        filters for Audacity; look in your Effects menu to see what is
        installed on your system. (<a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects">Chapter 11</a> tells where to find

      more comfortable listening in different environments. Because listening
      to a recording with a wide dynamic range in a noisy environment like a
      vehicle or at work means it’s always too loud or too soft, you can
      change this with a <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic range compressor</em></span>.
      Compressors are used all the time in audio production. I think they’re
      overused, but the neat thing with Audacity is you can adjust it to
      please yourself. A compressor usually attenuates the louder frequencies,
      reducing the difference between the soft and loud passages. Some
      compressors also boost the quieter frequencies. <a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html" title="Compress Dynamic Range">Compress Dynamic Range</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch12s09.html" title="Change Speed">Change Speed</a>

      the volume for the whole album. If you copied everything to a single

      dynamic range or change audio quality; all it does is raise the overall
      volume level. Set your maximum amplitude no higher than 0.0, which is
      the maximum for digital audio, and make sure that “Remove any DC offset”
      is checked. DC offset refers to the mean amplitude. If this is not zero,
      then normalization won’t be applied correctly because the amplitude
      levels will be unbalanced, and it might even create a bit of distortion.

      requires a special CD/DVD writer. These are in the same price range as
      ordinary CD/DVD writers, about $50.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ldo_i_need_to_buy_a_special_audio_cd_que"/><p class="title">“Do I need to buy a special audio CD?”</p><p>The answer to this commonly asked question is no. All CDs are
        exactly the same type. Some countries charge a tax on “audio” CDs that
        supposedly gets paid to musicians to compensate for lost income from
        illegal copying. (If they actually receive a fair share of this tax, I
        will eat my favorite vinyl LP.) The other special thing about them is
        a pressed data flag that is part of the Serial Copy Management System
        (SCMS) to control copying protected material. The SCMS encoding
        controls three states: copy allowed (00), copy once (11), and copy
        prohibited (10). It won’t stop you from making copies of an original
        CD. If the “copy once” flag is set, it might interfere with putting a
        copy on a CD writer that attaches to your hi-fi system. Computer
        hardware and media are exempt from the laws that mandate SCMS. I use
        ordinary nonaudio CD blanks, and they work fine in all CD
        players.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0119" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0120" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0121" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0122" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0123" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0124" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0125" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>

      monophonic phonograph records made from about the 1890s to the late
      1950s. These are also called <span class="emphasis"><em>short-play</em></span> records and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>wide-groove</em></span> records. There were no real industry
      standards until the early 1930s, so older records played at a variety of
      speeds, from 60 to 130 rpm. Vintage 78s are made of shellac mixed with
      dyes, fillers, and other materials, and they come in a range of sizes
      all the way up to 16″ in diameter. Some are laminated and will come
      apart if they get wet. Alcohol will dissolve shellac, and even too much
      humidity will hurt it.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0126" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0127" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Vinyl LPs, whether mono or stereo, play at 33 1/3 rpm, and singles
      play at 45 rpm or 78 rpm. Yes, way back in the olden days there were 78
      rpm singles; for example, these were favored by Disney in the early
      1960s. You might also find some 45 rpm LPs. Two main differences between
      these and vintage 78s is they are made of vinyl rather than shellac and
      they are cut in microgrooves rather than wide grooves. The coarse-groove
      records require a 3 mm stylus, while microgroove records use a 1 mm
      stylus. You can play old monophonic LPs and singles with a modern stereo
      cartridge and stylus, but not vintage records. There are modern
      cartridges and styli that are made for playing these old records, such
      as the popular Shure M78S.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0128" class="indexterm"/></p><p>I’m no expert on vintage 78s, but if you need more information on
      the correct ways to store, handle, and play these old-timers, there are
      a lot of great resources both online and in the real world. There are
      many vintage phonograph record experts, aficionados, and traders, so
      it’s not hard to find some expert guidance.</p><p>Once you have all the hardware and safe handling sorted out, there
      are a few things you need to do differently in Audacity. Open the
      <span class="strong"><strong>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Devices</strong></span>
      dialog and set the number of recording channels to 1 (mono). Then go to
      <span class="strong"><strong>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt;
      Import/Export</strong></span> and select “Use custom mix.” The reason for
      doing this is to mix down to two channels from your mono track so you’ll
      hear music in both speakers on your stereo system. If you don’t do this,
      you’ll get playback from only one speaker. <a class="xref" href="ch03s12.html#mixing_down_a_mono_recording_to_two_chan" title="Figure 3-10. Mixing down a mono recording to two channels for playback on stereo systems">Figure 3-10</a> shows you what

      components to your computer. First let’s talk about connectors. The
      terms <span class="emphasis"><em>plug, port, socket</em></span>, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>jack</em></span> are thrown around willy-nilly these days. Just
      to keep it clear and simple, I shall call the connecters on cables and
      adapters <span class="emphasis"><em>plugs</em></span>, and the things they plug into (like
      the RCA and TRS sockets on amplifiers) are <span class="emphasis"><em>jacks</em></span>.
      Also, in the interest of honoring standard terminology, I shall refer to
      plugs and jacks according to gender, male and female. This is especially
      important with gender changers, which are adapters for changing from one
      connection type to another.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0135" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0136" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In the olden days everyone used 1/4″ (6.3 mm) TRS plugs, and life
      was easy. Then manufacturers started making 1/8″ (3.5 mm) mini-jacks and
      plugs and the even dinkier 3/32″ (2.5 mm) micro-minis. It doesn’t matter
      what your devices have because there are adapters to fit any situation.
      In fact, it’s common for devices with mini-plugs to include 1/4″
      adapters, and you can also get adapters to fit 1/4″ plugs into
      mini-jacks. Just make sure you have a correctly matched adapter, either
      mono or stereo. Mono TRS plugs have one black insulator ring, and stereo
      plugs have two.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0137" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0138" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0139" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0140" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0141" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0142" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0143" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0144" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0145" class="indexterm"/></p><p>RCA audio connectors, fortunately, are still the same as they have
      always been. RCA plugs come in a rainbow of colors, and each color has a
      meaning: Red means right channel, white means left channel or mono
      channel, and the other colors are for different surround sound channels.
      They’re all the same, so it doesn’t matter if you use the “wrong”
      colors. There is only one size. They are also called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>phono</em></span> plugs. <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#two_stereo_rca_to_1_solidus_8p_trs_plug" title="Figure 2-7. Two stereo RCA to 1/8″ TRS plug, 1/4″ mono TRS to two stereo RCA, 1/8″ to 1/4″ stereo TRS adapter, 1/4″ to 1/8″ mono TRS adapter">Figure 2-7</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html" title="Multichannel Recording, PCI, USB, FireWire">Multichannel Recording, PCI, USB, FireWire</a> shows an

      you always need them, so get a grab bag for all occasions.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0146" class="indexterm"/></p><p>My favorite way to digitize legacy media is to connect a stereo
      amplifier or receiver to an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog
      converter (ADC/DAC), which then connects to the computer. Then every
      component that connects to the amp—turntable, tape deck, radio tuner,
      VCR, CD, DVD—is available to record in Audacity. (CDs and DVDs can be
      played and copied directly on your computer; see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Authoring a Compilation CD">Chapter 5</a> to learn how to do
      this.)<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0147" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You probably already have an ADC/DAC on your computer—your
      computer’s sound card. If it has a Line In port, you should use that.
      These are light blue 1/8″ stereo jacks. Depending on your amp or
      receiver, you should have a pair of standard RCA outputs you can connect
      to your sound card, usually called <span class="emphasis"><em>record out</em></span> or
      <span class="emphasis"><em>line out</em></span>.

        in addition to connecting through your amplifier connected to your
        computer. A popular method is to use a USB phono preamp that lets you
        connect any turntable, even cherished old ones, directly to your
        computer. In fact, you might want to look for a good old turntable
        instead of a modern one, because it’s hard to match the quality of
        those old turntables without spending a mint. You can pick up decent
        USB phono preamps for cheap, such as the ART USB Phono Plus V2 for
        around $100. It includes a gain control, a clipping indicator, a
        monitor port, a USB port, RCA inputs and outputs, optical ports, and
        an S/PDIF port. The ADC/DAC operates at 16/44.1 and 16/48. It even
        includes a phono ground connector, which is a must-have for turntables
        that have ground wires. If you don’t ground them, you’ll get an
        annoying hum.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0153" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0154" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You need a phono preamp and not just any old preamp, because
        phono preamps apply the RIAA equalization curve correction. This is
        very important. The <span class="emphasis"><em>RIAA equalization curve</em></span> is an
        industry standard for attenuating bass frequencies (below 500 Hz) on a
        vinyl LP and boosting frequencies above 2,120 Hz. Vinyl LPs have to be
        recorded this way or the bass grooves would take up most of the album,
        resulting in short playing time, and the higher frequencies would
        barely be audible. When you play a vinyl record, your integrated
        amplifier or receiver corrects this imbalance with a built-in phono
        preamp that reverses the RIAA curve. It sounds tinny with hardly any
        bass, and you can hear this by turning off your speakers and placing
        your ear close to the cartridge while a record is playing.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0155" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Amplifiers and receivers are called
          <span class="emphasis"><em>integrated</em></span> because the preamp is built in. Amps
          and receivers that accept separate preamps often still have
          integrated preamps. In the wacky world of audio components, you may
          spend more for a bare amplifier that doesn’t have an integrated
          preamp or radio tuner. The most expensive stereo amp I ever saw had
          a completely blank faceplate with only a power switch, power LED,
          and volume knob.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0156" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0157" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0158" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0159" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0160" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0161" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>The RIAA equalization curve became widely adopted starting
        around 1955, so records from before then may have different
        equalization curves. If you want to fuss with making your own
        handcrafted equalization corrections, you can do this in Audacity.
        Audacity also has a number of prefab equalization curves, such as
        Columbia LP, AES, Decca, and RCA. Use an ordinary preamp instead of a
        phono preamp to get an uncorrected signal, copy your album into
        Audacity, and then apply your own equalization. <a class="xref" href="ch03s13.html#the_equalization_effect_allows_you_to_fi" title="Figure 3-13. The Equalization effect allows you to fine-tune equalization any way you want, and it supports creating custom presets.">Figure 3-13</a> shows what the

          any way you want, and it supports creating custom presets.</p></div><p>A good way to connect a turntable to your recording interface,
        as mentioned earlier, is to connect your turntable to your stereo
        receiver or amplifier in the usual manner and then connect your
        receiver to your computer’s recording interface.</p><p>One more option to consider is buying a USB turntable with its
        own built-in phono preamp. These are becoming popular as more people
        want to try converting their own albums to CD. It’s a great concept
        and convenience, but a lot of them are not very good quality, so shop
        carefully.</p><p>My own personal turntable is an Audio-Technica AT-PL120. This is
        not a sweet decades-old turntable but a shiny new direct-drive
        three-speed with its own internal phono preamp. That’s right, 33 1/3,
        45, and 78. It’s designed to be a DJ turntable, so it comes with an
        elliptical stylus for playing records both frontward and backward.
        (The horror! As if I would do that to a perfectly good LP!) It has
        adjustable speed, pitch, antiskate, and feet levelers, and it’s
        weighty and solid as a good turntable should be. The internal preamp
        is switchable, so you can either connect it directly to a recording
        interface or switch off the internal preamp and connect to an external
        phono preamp. If you want to play vintage 78s, you need to purchase a
        special cartridge and stylus, such as the Shure M78S wide-groove
        monophonic cartridge.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0163" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0164" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0165" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0166" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0167" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0168" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0169" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0170" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Our excellent technical consultant Alvin notes that radio DJs

      vinyl LPs or CDs. I’ve been a serious music fan since I was a wee tot
      way back in the days of reel-to-reel tapes and vinyl LPs. My dad was a
      symphony musician and music teacher, and to this day I don’t believe he
      has acknowledged any music made after the 18th century. (Kidding, Dad!
      Hugs!) I think CDs are the bee’s knees.</p><p>In the olden days before CDs, a lot of music lovers who wanted to
      preserve their vinyl played a new LP only once, to copy it to tape. It
      was no use purchasing commercially recorded cassettes because of their
      inferior quality. They used the cheapest tape and were plagued with
      hiss, narrow dynamic range, and overall cruddy tone. By the early ’70s,
      commercially recorded reel tapes were pretty much gone from the market,
      so if you wanted good-quality tape recordings, you had to do it
      yourself.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0171" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0172" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0173" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0174" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This might sound like a lot of fussiness to readers who are not
      familiar with audio tapes and LPs, but there were shortcomings with both
      media, and neither one provided a completely satisfactory solution. It’s
      easier to skip tracks on an LP and they’re easier to handle than reel
      tapes, but it’s nearly impossible to keep them clean and undamaged.
      Neither one holds very much music. A vinyl LP holds 16 to 24 minutes per
      side; modern dance music LPs hold 12 minutes or less because of the
      extreme thumping bass, which creates wider grooves. Don’t even suggest
      using a record changer—those are for people who like having mangled
      records. A 1,200-foot, 7-inch reel of 1/4″ tape, which was common for
      home recording, holds 64 minutes per side at 3.75 inches per second
      (ips) and 32 minutes at 7.5 ips. (In comparison, professional recordings
      were made at 15 and 30 ips.) Neither one is easily portable, and you
      can’t play them in cars.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0175" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Cassette tapes revolutionized home and portable audio. They were
      good compromises among sound quality, portability, and cost, and they
      were a lot more rugged than reel tapes or LPs. You can stop a cassette
      tape at any point and remove it from the machine; you can’t do that very
      easily with reel tapes. Cassettes for the home market travel at 1 7/8
      ips, and their tapes are 0.15″ wide. Sound quality isn’t equal to that
      of LPs and reel tapes, but if you have a good recorder and use
      good-quality Type II or IV tape, it is pretty nice. Whenever I bought a
      new vehicle (new to me, that is), the first thing I did was put a good
      sound system in it. I made a lot of long trips because I liked going
      places, and having a big box of music tapes made those trips even more
      splendid. Cassette tapes came in a variety of sizes, and I liked
      90-minute cassette tapes because I could get two LPs on one tape. A
      dual-well cassette player with auto-reverse delivered 180 uninterrupted
      minutes of music. Larger sizes, such as 120-minute cassettes, were too
      thin and fragile to use. Thinner tapes stretch; 60-minute, high-quality
      tapes are thickest and suffer the least amount of stretch.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0176" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Cassette recorders recorders were the salvation of music lovers.
      My friends and I liked to make and exchange mix tapes, because even in
      my youth oh so long ago commercial radio was pretty horrible, just the
      same Top 20 dreck played over and over, with more commercials than music
      and annoying DJs interrupting the music. So, trading mix tapes was a
      great way to discover new music. Another cool thing was we could copy
      just the songs we wanted and not suffer through the filler that plagued
      so much popular music. Given the continual failures of the music
      industry to deliver what would please its customers, it’s amazing that
      it survives at all. The bosses at the big labels should give thanks
      every day to determined customers who figure out workarounds that let
      them enjoy commercially produced music, rather than giving up on it
      entirely.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0177" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="a_quick_tip_about_tape"/><p class="title">A Quick Tip About Tape</p><p>Alvin recalls that tape is manufactured very wide and very long:
        “The outermost edges, and the first and last lengths of the tape, are
        the poorest and used for the lowest-grade audio tape. The sections
        that are higher-grade become the higher quality audio tape, and the
        very best became the digital tape for computing. Because of this you
        can use most computer tape for audio, which I do. The large
        quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) tapes that have gone bad are fantastic
        reel-to-reel tapes. I have an ancient solid-state Ampex home audio
        recorder, circa 1969 (transistors, point-to-point wired like the old
        vacuum tubes). With no noise reduction, 1 7/8-, 3 3/4-, and 7 1/2-
        inch speeds, with RadioShack’s cheapest tape and slowest speed, it
        sounds better than cassette metal tape and Dolby C noise
        reduction.”<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0178" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Cassette tapes are also given credit for spreading Western pop
      music, especially punk and rock, in developing nations and Eastern bloc
      countries.</p><p>There isn’t much nostalgia for cassette tapes. They served a
      purpose, and some people still like them. But it’s not easy to find good
      cassettes anymore because manufacturing quality has declined.</p><p>Neither tape nor vinyl ages well. Tape is a magnetic medium, so it
      can be ruined by stray magnetic fields. Tape is less prone to collect
      dust and scratches than vinyl, but both suffer physical wear and tear.
      Both will last decades if they are handled and stored carefully, but the
      sad fact is the more you play and enjoy them, the more they will wear
      out. They won’t suddenly become unplayable; they tend to lose the high
      frequencies first and fade over time like a garment that is washed too
      many times.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Digital Advantage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_digital_advantage"/>The Digital Advantage</h2></div></div></div><p>Lovers of vinyl claim that it sounds warmer, sounds more true to
        life, and has a wider and more accurate dynamic range. CD fans claim
        that LP aficionados are nostalgic for all the ambience that goes along
        with playing a vinyl record: the sounds made by the turntable, the
        addition of surface noise from dust and scratches, flipping it to hear
        the other side, and all the fussiness required to keep LPs in good
        condition. I miss the cover art, posters, and generously sized
        booklets that came with LPs—you just can’t do much with a tiny CD
        case. But no matter how careful you are with keeping LPs clean,
        handling them carefully, keeping your stylus clean, and keeping your
        tonearm optimally balanced and tracked, it is impossible to avoid
        causing wear or even damage merely by playing them, because you’re
        scraping a diamond stylus with a Mohs’ scale hardness rating of 10
        over a surface with a Mohs’ hardness of 1.</p><p>Some LPs survive in better condition than others because they
        are better engineered. Vinyl LPs begin life as master tapes. These are
        copied to the master disk, which is made of metal or lacquer. Cutting
        a record is an exercise in compromise. Quiet passages can’t be too
        quiet or they will be lost in noise, but if they are too loud, the
        grooves will overlap and create skips. Louder volume also results in
        less playing time, so there is as much artistry in the engineering as
        there is the in music itself. Unfortunately, all LPs are not created
        equal. As the industry matured, a multitude of demands were placed on
        the master recording engineers, who were often told to make the master
        tapes also serve as masters for cassettes, and butchered for radio
        play. The vinyl itself became thinner. In other words, the lowest
        common denominator reared its mediocre head. Older LPs are beloved
        because they’re better made.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0179" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0180" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0181" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CDs have most of the technical advantages. The biggest advantage
        of digital audio is that copies are equal to the originals. This is
        not true of analog audio, which loses something with each generation.
        By the time you get to a copy of a copy of a copy, you know it’s a
        long way from the original.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0182" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A CD offers as much as a 96 dB dynamic range, range, whereas the
        best vinyl delivers maybe 75 dB and, more typically, in the 50s. So,
        the CD offers a superior signal-to-noise ratio, plus something that
        even the best LP system is hard-pressed to deliver, and that is
        absolute silence in the silent passages. True, this absolute silence
        is largely theoretical because some sound will probably be created
        somewhere in your audio chain—a bit of hum, a touch of electrical
        interference—but the CD itself is dead silent. Vinyl wins on frequency
        range, sort of—if you have good enough equipment (which would make you
        a rare, wealthy, and elite audiophile indeed), it will capture
        frequencies as high as 70 to 75 kHz, up there where the bats fly. More
        typically it falls into the 10 Hz to 25 kHz range.</p><p>Down here in the real world, most audio hardware is designed
        with upper limits of 20 to 30 kHz in mind. The human ear can detect
        frequencies up to 25 kHz, and the range of sensation is 50 kHz. If you
        have something blasting away at 115 dB sound pressure level at a
        frequency of 45 kHz, you’ll feel the pain but not know why. Some folks
        believe that very high frequencies are still perceived in some manner
        and add to the listener’s enjoyment. What they might be talking about
        are the harmonics. If you have a sound at 100 Hz, there are harmonics
        of that sound at 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 200 Hz, and so on. If you clip the
        harmonics, the sound tends to sound a little dead on the high
        end.</p><p>I have compared some of my favorite music on both CD and LP, and
        it’s the extra noise on LPs that sets them apart. I can really tell
        the difference in a symphony—the quiet passages on a CD are unmarred
        by scratches, hiss, or rumble, and the loud bits are loud and
        accurate, without distortion. If you want to make your own
        comparisons, make sure you have LPs and CDs that have been recorded
        with skill and care. An awful lot of them are junk, and the trend with
        modern popular music is simply to crank all levels on a CD to the
        maximum, with no regard for dynamic range, distortion, nuances, or
        balance. Pianos and organs are great for testing the quality of your
        audio system because their sounds are difficult to reproduce
        accurately, they have monster dynamic and frequency ranges, and you
        can tell pretty easily if they sound right. Try “Toccata and Fugue in
        D Minor” by Johann Sebastian Bach; this covers the full range of the
        pipe organ, the big kind you see in cathedrals. At one point, a bass
        pedal is held so long your speakers may visibly distort. Pink Floyd’s
        “Time” from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dark Side of the Moon</em></span> exercises
        the sound separation among left, right, and true center. Jimi
        Hendrix’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Electric Ladyland</em></span>, if you can find the
        original double LP and not some bad CD remaster, is an amazing piece
        of studio and artistic wizardry that will exercise your audio system
        and reward careful listening.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0183" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0184" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0185" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="wire_recordings"/><p class="title">Wire Recordings</p><p>The original master “tapes” were made on wire recorders, which
          used spools of steel wire as the recording medium. Wire recorders
          were in wide use until the 1960s, when they were supplanted by
          magnetic tape recorders. Old music, like the original Carter Family
          recordings of the 1920s, were recorded on wire recorders. Wire
          rusts, and the fidelity is nothing to get excited about, but it is
          very durable. Even so, most of those old recordings are lost.</p><p>But not all! <span class="emphasis"><em>The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in
          Performance 1949</em></span> won the 2008 Grammy for Best Historical
          Album. It was restored from wire recordings and is believed to be
          his only recorded live performance. Like a lot of wire recorders,
          these recordings were made on a home-built device, which complicates
          any restoration process. But restored they were, and now you can
          enjoy Woody Guthrie live on CD.</p></div><p>CDs win hands down for convenience. They’re sturdy, they don’t
        get damaged from being played, you don’t have to continually fuss with
        them, and they are portable. Most CD players have remote controls, and
        you can play the tracks in any order or shuffle. You can load multiple
        CDs in a CD changer without harm and bliss out for hours.</p><p>Despite the efforts of the music industry to foil our fair use
        rights and desire to enjoy music the way we want to, it’s as easy to
        create custom-mix CDs as it was to create our own mix tapes. And for
        most of the same reasons: to package music the way we want and to
        discover new artists. (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Authoring a Compilation CD">Chapter 5</a>
        tells how to make compilation CDs.) However, we now have two marvelous
        new options that we didn’t have back in the olden days, and that is
        satellite radio and Internet radio. Neither one is high on the audio
        quality scale, but you can’t beat them for variety and discovering new
        artists. Commercial broadcast radio is worse than ever, which I didn’t
        believe was possible.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0186" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0187" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0188" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0189" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CDs also win on cost. A hundred dollars buys a perfectly
        satisfactory CD player. Even in the olden days, a good-quality
        turntable, cartridge, and stylus cost several hundred dollars, and
        they haven’t gotten any cheaper. Oh, and don’t forget the dust cover,
        which was always an overpriced add-on. And a stylus-tracking force
        gauge, and cartridge alignment tool, and special cleaning accessories,
        and so on.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0190" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0191" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0192" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0193" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="cd_players"/><p class="title">CD Players</p><p>You can spend a little or a lot on a CD player.player Ideally,
          you’ll be able to test them with your own sound system before making
          a purchase, especially if you’re going for a higher-end model. As
          with all digital audio, the quality of the digital-to-analog
          converter determines how good it sounds, so spending more can make a
          difference. If you are connecting your CD player to a receiver or
          amplifier that has its own DAC (you’ll see optical or coaxial
          digital inputs), that gives you two DACs to try. Using the digital
          connector means the CD player sends a digital signal to your
          receiver and does not use its own DAC. Instead, the receiver
          performs the conversion to analog. Using your CD player’s RCA
          connectors means your CD player will do the conversion and send an
          analog signal to your receiver. If you have a high-end CD player,
          you probably don’t want your receiver mucking with its output, so
          use the analog RCA connectors. Of course, it’s not always that
          simple, because in some modern A/V receivers, the integrated preamp
          converts all incoming signals with no regard for whether they are
          analog or digital, which is dumb, but there it is. This is not
          always documented, so you might have to pester your vendor to find
          out what you have.</p></div><p>So who wins, vinyl or CDs? Easy—whichever one you like better.

        digital storage is not encouraging for the long term, so you better
        plan to periodically transfer your archives to fresh media. There are
        several problems with long-term digital storage: One, the physical
        media may not last for more than a few years without deteriorating.
        Two, think of all the closed, proprietary file formats that have come
        and gone in the past 10 or 20 years and are no longer readable. Three,
        if your media survive and the files are still readable, will you have
        a hardware device that can read your media? If someone handed you a
        5.25″ disk, a Zip disk, a 3.5″ diskette, or a super floppy disk, would
        you have any idea what to do with it? Currently we take CDs, DVDs, USB
        sticks, and 3.5″ hard drives for granted, but they are all just a few
        years old, and we do not know what the future holds.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>There might be a business opportunity in old drives and

        don’t use CD-RWs for anything that you want to last more than a year
        or two.</p><p>There are significant differences in brands. Taiyo Yuden is the
