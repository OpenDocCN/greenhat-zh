- en: Wi-Fi (short for Wireless Fidelity, pronounced "why-fie") networks use radio
    signals instead of Ethernet cables to connect computers and other devices to a
    LAN. Wi-Fi is a convenient alternative to conventional wired networks because
    any wireless-enabled computer within range of the Wi-Fi signal can join the network;
    there's no need to find a network outlet. This can be particularly useful when
    it's not practical to pull data cables through walls, ceilings, and floors, and
    when a user wants to connect a laptop computer or a handheld device such as an
    iPhone or BlackBerry to an existing network or through a LAN to the Internet.
    And of course, thousands of Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces such as airports,
    coffee shops, libraries, and schools offer easy access to the Internet when you're
    away from your own home or office.

    the same data that moves between a computer and a base station by radio can be
    intercepted by another computer. Even if the data is encrypted, a dedicated intruder
    with enough time can steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal
    information. However, the latest security tools, including WPA encryption and
    virtual private networks (VPNs), can go a long way toward making a Wi-Fi network

    than the promised maximum, especially when the path between the access point and
    a computer's wireless adapter is indoors. Walls, furniture, and other objects
    between the two antennas can all reduce the signal strength. 802.11b networks
    were the first to appear, and they were the most common type until the faster
    802.11g version became available. 802.11a uses different radio frequencies, but
    many network adapters are compatible with both 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz access points.

    services, including wireless data networks. 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n all

    GHz known as the *Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    This means that the people who make the equipment must demonstrate that their
    designs meet various regulations related to maximum power, interference, and so
    forth, but actual users (that's you and me) don't need to obtain licenses before
    they can operate approved radios. One result of this is that the same radio frequencies
    used by Wi-Fi networks are also filled with signals from cordless telephones,
    medical equipment, radio-controlled toys, and microwave ovens, among many other
    things. Wi-Fi and those other devices use different methods to transmit and receive
    radio signals, so there's not much danger that the Wi-Fi adapter in your laptop
    computer will cause a model-train wreck or cause your cordless phone to ring.
    However, other ISM or U-NII signals, along with Wi-Fi signals from other nearby
    users, can add noise to your Wi-Fi signal that reduces the network's data transfer
    speed.

    is the only major country that uses all of them. Only 11 of those channels are
    used in North America and China, while most of Europe uses 13 channels. In France,
    only 4 channels are available. Each channel operates on a different frequency,
    numbered from Channel 1 to Channel 14.

    signals use 11 separate overlapping channels. Notice that channels 1, 6, and 11
    do not interfere with each other."), so the channels with adjacent numbers can
    interfere with one another. Like the interference from other ISM devices, adjacent-channel
    interference can create a slower, noisier connection. Therefore, when you're setting
    up a new network or adding an access point to an existing network, it's best to
    choose a channel number as far away from the channels used by nearby networks
    as possible.

    of obstructions or interference), the best solution is to add a second (or third)
    access point at a location where its signal will fill in the dead spots. Each
    access point should be connected to the wired portion of the network through an
    Ethernet hub or switch or, if that's not practical, through a wireless bridge
    that retransmits Wi-Fi signals on a different channel. In a Wi-Fi network with
    more than one access point, they should all use the same network name, but each
    one should use a different non-overlapping operating channel.

    process also includes some additional setup options. See [Chapter 10](ch10.html
    "Chapter 10. CONNECTING YOUR NETWORK TO THE INTERNET") for information about configuring
    a router or modem. If you're using a separate access point, it's usually best
    to turn off the DHCP server in the access point and obtain all of the network's
    addresses from the router or modem.

    select a Wi-Fi network and establish a connection. Windows, Mac OS X, and various

    usually doesn't matter—all of them detect the strong nearby access points' signals
    that you will use most often.

    data they carry. If you send confidential information through a wireless link,

    first is the danger of an outsider connecting to your network without your knowledge
    or permission; the second is the possibility that a dedicated eavesdropper can
    steal or modify data as you send and receive it. Each represents a different potential
    problem, and each requires a different approach to prevention and protection.
    Although none of the encryption tools currently available can provide complete
    protection, they can make life more difficult for most casual intruders. And as
    long as the tools are out there, you might as well use them.

    the fact that wireless networks are not completely secure and use the built-in
    network security features to slow down would-be intruders; second, you can supplement
    your wireless router's built-in tools with a hardware or software *firewall* (or
    both) to isolate the wireless network (but remember that a cracker who can grab
    and decode encrypted network passwords can often grab firewall passwords too);
    and third, you can use additional encryption such as a *VPN (virtual private network)*
    to make the network more secure.

    adequate to protect data. The WEP protocol was flawed in several ways. WEP should
    be treated more as a "Do Not Disturb" sign than as a real means of protection.
    The WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 standards attempt to fix the shortcomings
    of WEP, but they work only when all of the users of your network have modern cards
    and drivers.

    good enough to keep out your own users, let alone unknown intruders who want to

    in your access point. Access control restricts network connections to network
    clients with specified MAC addresses. The access point will refuse to associate
    with any network device whose address is not on the list. This might not be practical
    if you want to allow visitors to use your network, but it's a useful tool in a
    home or small business network where you know all of your potential users. MAC
    address filtering will not prevent a determined attacker from copying and spoofing
    the address of an authenticated user, but it could provide an additional layer
    of protection.
