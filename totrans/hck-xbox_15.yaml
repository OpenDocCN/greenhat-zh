    iron into the space between the component lead and the circuit board pad to heat
    both pieces up. Once they are sufficiently hot, gradually feed some solder wire
    into the joint until a nice, smooth solder fillet is created. In reality, soldering
    requires a bit of practice and experience before one is able to solder a typical
    board with over a thousand joints without any bad solder joints. In order for
    a good solder joint to be created, the hot liquid solder must “wet” the subject
    pieces in order for a connection to be made. Thus, the real art of hand-soldering
    is understanding how to guarantee solder wetting.'

  zh: 焊接的基本技术相当简单：将焊锡铁头的尖端楔入组件引脚和电路板焊盘之间的空间，以加热这两块材料。一旦它们足够热，逐渐将一些焊丝喂入焊缝，直到形成漂亮、平滑的焊料圆角。实际上，焊接需要一些练习和经验，才能在没有不良焊缝的情况下焊接一个有超过一千个焊点的典型电路板。为了创建良好的焊缝，热的液态焊料必须“润湿”主体材料，以便建立连接。因此，手工焊接的真正艺术在于理解如何保证焊料润湿。
- en: You can tell when liquid solder is wetting a piece of metal by looking at it.
    A wetted joint looks like the molten solder has lost all surface tension; the
    liquid solder is shiny and it flows smoothly over the work area. In the opposite
    situation, the solder has a dull sheen to it, and it tends to ball up around the
    soldering iron tip instead of flowing outward.

  zh: 你可以通过观察来判断液态焊料是否润湿了一块金属。润湿的焊缝看起来像熔化的焊料已经失去了所有表面张力；液态焊料是闪亮的，并且在工作区域上流畅地流动。在相反的情况下，焊料表面看起来是暗淡的，并且倾向于在焊锡铁头周围形成球状，而不是向外流动。

  zh: '**使用助焊剂**'
- en: Solder fails to wet the subject metal because oxygen in the air or dirt and
    grease have reacted with the metals. In this case, you can apply a *flux* to your
    workpiece to break down these foreign compounds. The word flux comes from the
    Latin *fluxus*, which means flowing. Most solder comes with a core of flux built
    in to enhance solderability. If you look at a cut piece of solder carefully, you
    can see the flux core surrounded by the solder alloy. Always use solder with a
    flux core, or you will be in a world of pain trying to get the solder to wet.
    Almost all solders made specifically for electronics have a flux core, but there
    are solders that you can accidental y purchase in a hardware store that have no
    flux, and that are made for purposes such as joining pipes. When you heat a flux-core
    solder, a small puff of vaporized flux smoke will rise up. A small fan placed
    near the work area will blow the fumes away and prevent inhalation.

  zh: 焊料未能润湿主体金属，因为空气中的氧气或污垢和油脂已经与金属发生了反应。在这种情况下，你可以将*助焊剂*应用到你的工件上，以分解这些外来化合物。助焊剂这个词来源于拉丁语*fluxus*，意为流动。大多数焊料都内置了助焊剂核心，以增强可焊性。如果你仔细观察一段切割的焊料，你可以看到助焊剂核心被焊料合金包围。始终使用带有助焊剂核心的焊料，否则你将陷入痛苦，试图让焊料润湿。几乎所有专门为电子产品制造的焊料都有助焊剂核心，但你在五金店偶然购买的焊料可能没有助焊剂，并且是用于管道连接等目的的。当你加热助焊剂核心焊料时，会有一小股助焊剂蒸汽上升。在工作区域附近放置一个小风扇可以将烟雾吹走，防止吸入。
- en: A common novice mistake is to have too much faith in flux-core solder. Frequently,
    the flux contained in a flux core solder is not enough to get the solder to wet.
    In this case, you will need to apply extra flux. Raw flux comes usually as a liquid
    or a paste, so application is easy. In liquid form, a single drop of flux can
    be applied with half of a toothpick. Break the toothpick in half, leaving the
    break slightly jagged. Dip the broken end of the toothpick into the flux, and
    a small drop will cling to the end. Applying liquid flux to a large area can be
    done with a fine-tipped artist’s brush, but be sure to clean the brush when you
    are done or it will end up gummy and unusable in a couple of days. A flux dropper
    is also handy, but expensive. A flux dropper is a bottle with a thin capillary
    needle on top; when you invert the bottle, flux slowly drips out of the capillary.
    In paste form, flux can be applied by dipping any piece of scrap, such as a toothpick
    or a piece of solid wire, in the flux paste. Finally, flux pens are handy for
    beginners because they combine flux storage and dispensing in a convenient and
    inexpensive package. Flux pens don’t have the accuracy or quality of other flux
    application techniques, but they are convenient and good for occasional use.

  zh: 一个常见的初学者错误是过分依赖膏状焊料。通常，膏状焊料中含有的助焊剂不足以使焊料润湿。在这种情况下，你需要额外施加助焊剂。原始的助焊剂通常以液体或膏状形式出现，因此应用起来很方便。在液体形式下，只需用牙签的一半滴上一滴助焊剂。将牙签折断，使断裂处略微粗糙。将牙签的断裂端浸入助焊剂中，一小滴助焊剂会附着在末端。用细尖画家的画笔将液体助焊剂涂覆在大面积上，但务必在完成后清洁画笔，否则几天后它将变得粘稠且无法使用。助焊剂滴管也很方便，但价格昂贵。助焊剂滴管是一个顶部有细长毛细管的瓶子；当你倒置瓶子时，助焊剂会缓慢地从毛细管中滴出。在膏状形式下，可以通过将任何碎片，如牙签或一段实心电线，浸入助焊剂膏中来施加助焊剂。最后，助焊剂笔对初学者来说很方便，因为它们将助焊剂的储存和分配结合在一个方便且价格低廉的包装中。助焊剂笔没有其他助焊剂应用技术的精度或质量，但它们很方便，适合偶尔使用。
- en: Many fluxes require clean-up after use. Fluxes can harden with time, making
    repairs difficult in the future, they can slowly attack the board, and they can
    absorb water and become conductive. The traditional soldering flux is a resin
    flux. Resin fluxes require the use of strong solvents that are flammable and toxic.
    As a result, I tend to recommend water soluble fluxes or no-clean fluxes. Water
    soluble fluxes can be removed by just washing down the board with water. It is
    better to use distilled deionized water, but I have found that most warm tap water
    is pretty effective as well. When I have to clean a large batch of boards, I throw
    them into a dishwasher (with the food trap cleaned and no detergent!). After the
    boards are washed, set them on a conductive, clean cookie sheet or aluminum foil,
    and put them into an oven on low heat (around 200°F) to bake for about an hour
    or two, or until all the water is driven away. Be sure not to turn the oven up
    too high, or water trapped inside the pores of components will turn into steam
    and cause them to crack or explode. Most parts are designed to be “process sealed”
    so washing them with water is fine. Be careful with connectors and switches, however;
    you may need to tape over them with a piece of Kapton tape to prevent contamination
    with water.

  zh: 许多助焊剂在使用后需要清理。助焊剂会随着时间的推移而硬化，使得未来的维修变得困难，它们会慢慢腐蚀电路板，并且会吸收水分而变得导电。传统的焊接助焊剂是一种树脂助焊剂。树脂助焊剂需要使用强溶剂，这些溶剂易燃且有毒。因此，我倾向于推荐水溶性助焊剂或无清洁助焊剂。水溶性助焊剂可以通过用水冲洗电路板来去除。最好使用蒸馏去离子水，但我发现大多数温水也很有效。当我必须清洗大量电路板时，我会把它们扔进洗碗机（食物过滤网已清洁且无洗涤剂！）。电路板清洗后，将它们放在一个导电、干净的饼干盘或铝箔上，然后放入烤箱低温（约200°F）烘烤大约一两个小时，或者直到所有水分蒸发。务必不要将烤箱温度调得太高，否则被困在元件孔隙中的水会变成蒸汽，导致它们开裂或爆炸。大多数元件设计为“工艺密封”，因此用水清洗它们是可以的。然而，对于连接器和开关要小心；你可能需要用一块Kapton胶带覆盖它们，以防止水分污染。

- en: Components with many leads need to be aligned and tacked in place before soldering.
    If the component is of a surface-mount type, it can be held in place by soldering
    down two pins on opposite corners of the device. After tacking the component in
    place, re-inspect the alignment in case the component drifted during the tacking
    process. If the component is of a through-hole type, you will need masking tape
    to hold it in place while you turn the board over. Tack the corner leads of the
    component in place, and check that it is level to the board before soldering all
    of the leads. (Masking tape has a bit of play in it and frequently you will have
    to heat one of the tacked corners while pressing down on the component to level
    the component with the board.)

    Kapton can withstand temperatures up to 500oF, well above the melting point of
    solder. It is handy for masking off nearby regions where you do not want solder.
    However, Kapton tape is expensive so use it only in situations where it will come
    in contact with hot solder.

- en: Solder fails to wet metal that is too cold. This is a common problem when soldering
    large joints, or when soldering joints attached to large sheets of copper. In
    these cases, the connected metal conducts enough heat away so that the junction
    never reaches the melting point of solder. The solution to this is either to use
    a more powerful soldering iron (but be careful—the heat of very large soldering
    irons can also cause the board traces to fal off), or to leave your soldering
    iron in contact with the junction for a longer period of time before applying
    the solder. One trick to heating up the work area faster is to feed just a touch
    of solder into the tip of the iron where it is heating things up. Even though
    the solder will not wet on the board, the liquid solder on the iron’s tip increases
    the effective contact area between the iron and the board, and heat will be transferred
    more rapidly into the board.

  zh: 焊料无法润湿过冷的金属。在焊接大型接头或焊接连接到大型铜板的接头时，这是一个常见问题。在这些情况下，连接的金属会传导足够的热量，使得接头永远不会达到焊料的熔点。解决这个问题的方法是使用更强大的烙铁（但请注意——非常大的烙铁的热量也可能导致电路板上的走线脱落），或者在使用焊料之前，让烙铁与接头保持更长时间的接触。加快加热工作区域的一个小技巧是将一小滴焊料喂入烙铁尖端，在那里它正在加热东西。即使焊料不会在板上润湿，烙铁尖端上的液态焊料增加了烙铁和板之间的有效接触面积，热量会更快地传递到板上。
- en: After applying solder to the iron’s tip, you will sometimes have to rotate the
    iron, maintaining contact at the joint, in order to get the molten solder in contact
    with the board. You can tell when a component lead or a board pad is sufficiently
    hot by carefully observing the way light reflects off of it. Component leads and
    pads on a circuit board typically have some kind of plating on them, usually made
    out of solder. This solder plating has a slightly dull sheen under normal conditions.
    When made sufficiently hot, however, the sheen goes from dull to almost perfectly
    reflective. To get a feel for what this looks like, try heating up a large square
    pad with your soldering iron, using the technique described above. You can usually
    watch the melting front propagate across the pad as the soldering iron heats the
    board.

  zh: 在将焊料应用到烙铁尖端后，有时你需要旋转烙铁，同时保持与接头的接触，以便让熔化的焊料接触到板。你可以通过仔细观察光线如何从它反射来判断一个元件引脚或板上的焊盘是否足够热。电路板上的元件引脚和焊盘通常有一些镀层，通常是焊料制成的。在正常条件下，这种焊料镀层略带哑光。然而，当加热到足够高的温度时，光泽从哑光变为几乎完美反光。为了了解这看起来像什么，尝试使用上述技术加热一个大的正方形焊盘，使用烙铁加热板。你通常可以看到熔化前沿随着烙铁加热板而传播。

- en: An easier and cheaper solution is to use a heat gun, like the ones sold in hardware
    stores for removing linoleum floor tiles. The heat gun will heat the entire region
    of a board, and components will float off their pads with minimal damage to their
    leads. The downside of this technique is that it is not very precise, so it is
    not an ideal solution for removing chips on boards that are going to be used again.
    As a result, heat guns are most effective for salvaging good chips from broken
    boards. The other problem with using heat guns is that the heat can warp boards
    or cause destructive failures in chips that have absorbed moisture into their
    packages. This failure mode, called “popcorning,” happens when moisture trapped
    inside a chip boils but cannot escape, causing a pressure buildup that culminates
    in a destructive release event. Chips and boards operating in a humid environment
    or that have been washed in water should be baked in an oven at around 200 to
    250°F for a few hours before desoldering with a heat gun.

- en: The “ball grid array” (BGA) package is a type of surface mount package that

    These packages are attached to a board through a large array of solder bal s underneath

    soldering iron. In addition, BGA packages are very difficult to inspect because
    most of the solder connections are buried deep below the package. The only viable
    method for attaching these components is to use an oven that heats the whole board
    and the component to the point where all the solder balls melt. Typically, the
