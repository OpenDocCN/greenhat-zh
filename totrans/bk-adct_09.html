    digital realm than it is in the analog world. No waiting for tapes to
    rewind, no physically cutting and pasting tapes—it’s all just
    pointy-clicky bit shuffling. Although Audacity isn’t the most
    sophisticated application for heavy-duty multitrack recording and editing,
    you can make excellent mono and stereo recordings with it and even 5.1 and
    7.1 surround sound. It’s the real deal, with discrete tracks.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0002" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>That’s as in separate, not as in able to keep a secret. Discrete
      is an important term in audio because it tells you when you’re getting
      the real deal, and not something simulated. For example, a surround
      sound hi-fi system will emulate 5.1 sound from a stereo recording, which
      has only two discrete channels. Real 5.1 has six discrete
      channels.</p></div><p>What is Audacity missing? It doesn’t have per-track recording level
    meters, and you can’t make edits while tracks are playing. When you’re
    using a multichannel recording device, you can’t control which input goes
    to which track. Multichannel surround mixing is still rather rudimentary:
    You can export to 5.1 and 7.1 surround, but Audacity gives you no help
    mapping the channels. Audacity’s strengths lie in recording, editing, and
    mixing for mono and stereo playback. Ardour might be a better choice for
    Linux and Mac users who want to perform heavy-duty studio wizardry,
    perform multichannel surround, and have maximum control, and of course
    Windows and Mac users have great thundering herds of other high-end audio
    production suites to choose from.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So, what can Audacity do? It will record as many channels at one
    time as your recording interface supports and your computer can handle.
    Some examples of multichannel recording interfaces are the M-Audio Delta
    1010 PCI sound card (10 × 10), the Edirol FA-101 FireWire audio interface
    (10 × 10), the RME Hammerfall sound cards, and the M-Audio NRV10, which is
    a useful combination of an analog mixer and 10-channel FireWire
    DAC/ADC.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Audacity has no hard limit for the total number of tracks in a
    project; you can keep adding tracks until your computer keels over.
    Audacity supports all of the basic multitrack editing and mixing
    functions: mix and match clips, time-shift and synchronize, layer multiple
    copies of the same track or clip, do fix-its and special effects, and
    mixdown to any number of channels from 1 to 32 (WAV, AIFF, and Ogg Vorbis;
    other file formats support fewer channels). In real life, mono, stereo,
    and 5.1 surround (6 channel) are your likeliest options.</p><div class="sect1" title="Tracks, Channels, and Clips"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tracks_comma_channels_comma_and_clips"/>Tracks, Channels, and Clips</h1></div></div></div><p>Let’s take a moment to be sure of our terminology. A single track
      in Audacity is represented by a single waveform, as in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#this_is_what_a_single_mono_track_looks_l" title="Figure 9-1. This is what a single mono track looks like—one waveform, no matter how many voices or instruments are recorded on the track.">Figure 9-1</a>. I call this a
      mono track to make it clear that it’s not a stereo track. However, the
      definition of <span class="emphasis"><em>track</em></span> is a bit fuzzy in audio and
      also in Audacity because it treats a stereo track the same way it treats
      a mono track—even though there are two channels with two different
      waveforms, Audacity sees a stereo track as one track, and everything you
      do to it is applied equally to both channels. A track is also a single
      song in a track, CD, LP, or tape that contains several songs.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="this_is_what_a_single_mono_track_looks_l"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11785"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797645.png.jpg" alt="This is what a single mono track looks like—one waveform, no matter how many voices or instruments are recorded on the track."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-1. This is what a single mono track looks like—one waveform, no

      When you record using a single mono microphone, that is a single input
      channel even if you have an entire orchestra playing and choir singing.
      Multichannel recording interfaces let you use more microphones and
      instrument plug-ins, which creates more tracks.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The number of input channels in <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Devices</strong></span> must match the number of your

      and instrument its own mic. Studio recording is nothing like live
      recording—sometimes every performer is in a separate soundproof cubicle,
      or recorded at different times and different locations, so the various
      band members might never even be physically present at the same time.
      It’s a common practice to use multiple mics on a single performer and
      then manipulate the resulting multiple tracks to create absolute perfect
      wonderfulness (or an overproduced glop, as the case may be).</p><p>Be careful with the physical recording inputs that you plug your
      mics and instruments into—some are mono, some will be stereo, some will
      require phantom power, and others will be for various other purposes. Be
      sure you’re plugging things in correctly—just because it fits doesn’t
      mean it’s right.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>A good habit to develop is to never hotplug anything, unless you
        are certain it is safe to do so. Don’t turn on phantom power until
        after your condenser mics are plugged in. Don’t plug anything into
        your amp, preamp, mixer, and so on with the power on, or at least make
        sure all volume controls are at zero. Turn power off before
        unplugging. Most audio equipment is tolerant of a certain amount of
        abuse. But pops from hotplugging are annoying and may damage your
        equipment.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0022" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>If you use a stereo mic on a mono recording input, only one
      channel will record, and you’ll have a stereo track like the one in
      <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#this_is_what_happens_when_you_plug_a_ste" title="Figure 9-2. This is what happens when you plug a stereo microphone into a single-channel recording input.">Figure 9-2</a> with one

        single-channel recording input.</p></div><p>No worries if this happens to you; just use the Track menu to
      separate a stereo track into two tracks, and then delete the empty one.
      There are two split track options: Split Stereo Track creates a left and
      a right track, while Split Stereo to Mono creates two mono tracks. (You
      can use this same menu to join two individual tracks into a single
      stereo track.) Assigning a track left, right, or mono is important when
      you mixdown to stereo: Left tracks go to the left channel, right tracks
      go to the right channel, and mono goes to both. (See <a class="xref" href="ch09s10.html" title="Mixdown to Stereo">Mixdown to Stereo</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch09s10.html" title="Mixdown to Stereo">Mixdown to Stereo</a>

      stereo microphone inputs, but then only one channel works. If you try a
      mono microphone on one of these, it may not work at all, so I can’t
      resist giving the obvious warning: Test it before you need it.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap">Chapter 2</a>
        for a refresher on setting up audio hardware, and consult your product
        documentation. Beware anyone who wants to “help” you! It’s your gear,
        and you don’t want the help of people who don’t know what they’re
        doing, which is quite a large number of folks who think they’re
        experts (such as professional musicians who have been on stage all
        their lives and rely on the old “whack it until something happens”
        technique). Your peace of mind and equipment are more important than
        their egos.</p></div><p>Output channels are like input channels. If you create a 5.1
      surround mix that is six discrete channels—left, right, center, surround
      left, surround right, and low-frequency effects (LFE)—you could take a
      single mono track and export it to 5.1 surround, as <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#an_amusing_example_of_creating_a_5.1_wav" title="Figure 9-3. An amusing example of creating a 5.1 WAV file from a single track using Audacity’s custom export mixer">Figure 9-3</a> shows. I don’t
      know why you would want to, but it’s there if you do. Audacity supports
      a maximum of 32 output channels. If you have a playback device that
      supports 32 channels, you will have yourself one heck of a fun time. A
      more realistic option for all those channels is to export them to a
      single 32-bit WAV file, or 32 individual WAV files (using <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export
      Multiple</strong></span>), and then import them into a more sophisticated
      mixing application for advanced mixing and studio wizardry. For example,
      some users like to record and edit in Audacity and then do the final mix
      in a different program that does things Audacity doesn’t do, such as
      support MIDI, or that has more sophisticated multitrack mixing. Since
      Audacity is free, it doesn’t cost anything but some time to try
      different workflows.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0031" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="an_amusing_example_of_creating_a_5.1_wav"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11929"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797649.png.jpg" alt="An amusing example of creating a 5.1 WAV file from a single track using Audacity’s custom export mixer"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-3. An amusing example of creating a 5.1 WAV file from a single

      lot of fun with clips, such as changing what a person says in an
      interview by moving the words around, making loops, or grabbing clips
      from different recordings and blending them together in new and
      different ways. You can have several clips in a single track or put each
      one in its own track. You can even drag clips from one track to another
      using the Time Shift tool (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#clips_can_be_moved_independently_all_ove" title="Figure 9-4. Clips can be moved independently all over the place with the Time Shift tool, even to different tracks.">Figure 9-4</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0032" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="clips_can_be_moved_independently_all_ove"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11946"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797651.png.jpg" alt="Clips can be moved independently all over the place with the Time Shift tool, even to different tracks."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-4. Clips can be moved independently all over the place with the

<div class="sect1" title="How to Make Multitrack Recordings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_to_make_multitrack_recordings"/>How to Make Multitrack Recordings</h1></div></div></div><p>There are several ways to make multitrack recordings. One way is
      to use a multichannel recording interface and record all of your tracks
      at one time. Another way is to record new tracks at different times into
      an existing project; this is called <span class="emphasis"><em>overdubbing</em></span>.
      Another way to manage a multitrack project is to run multiple recording
      sessions, each in its own Audacity project, and then copy tracks from
      these into a single Audacity project.</p><p>For recording larger numbers of tracks at once, I have a Focusrite
      Saffire Pro 26, which is an excellent multichannel FireWire recording
      interface. It has eight microphone preamps, phantom power, two ADAT
      banks (16 channels), S/PDIF, 24/192 digital I/O, and a lot of other
      goodies. <a class="xref" href="ch09s02.html#recording_four_tracks_at_one_time_with_t" title="Figure 9-5. Recording four tracks at one time with the Focusrite Saffire Pro">Figure 9-5</a>
      shows a four-channel recording session in Audacity using the Saffire. As
      you can see, it doesn’t look special: It’s just four channels all
      recording at the same time. The Saffire can theoretically handle 26
      recording inputs at one time, which Audacity can handle with no problem;
      the only limitation is what my computer can handle. (Audacity versions
      before 1.3.8 are limited to 16 inputs at once.)<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="recording_four_tracks_at_one_time_with_t"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11993"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797653.png.jpg" alt="Recording four tracks at one time with the Focusrite Saffire Pro"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-5. Recording four tracks at one time with the Focusrite Saffire
        Pro</p></div><p>My little M-Audio MobilePre USB can record four inputs at once.
      However, it is really a stereo recording interface with only two
      discrete input and output channels. So recording four inputs means that
      two are combined on each channel, and instead of four tracks that can be
      manipulated individually, there are only two. This once again
      illustrates that in the great wide world of audio, there are many ways
      to do things.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0041" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Many higher-end sound cards and recording interfaces are designed
      to be combined, and then they appear to Audacity as a single interface.
      Audacity does not have the ability to combine multiple recording
      interfaces; it must see a single device with multiple channels. Windows
      and Mac users get special drivers and management software to do this.
      With luck you can combine lower-end sound cards as well. However, in my
      experience, combining cheapo sound cards is painful and unreliable on
      any platform, so I’m going to pretend that such an option does not
      exist.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0042" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Remember that Audacity supports almost unlimited undos and

      used to divide long tracks copied from vinyl LPs into individual song
      tracks. When you’re editing multiple tracks, you can also use them for
      bookmarks and notes and to create alignment markers. Each audio track
      can have its own label track (<a class="xref" href="ch09s04.html#you_may_use_as_many_label_tracks_as_you" title="Figure 9-8. You may use as many label tracks as you like.">Figure 9-8</a>). New label tracks
      are created by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>Add New</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Label Track</strong></span>. Position label tracks by grabbing
      the track label with the cursor and dragging them or by using the Track

      with backing up your Audacity projects, because they exist only inside
      Audacity. Label tracks can be exported and imported just like audio
      tracks, but unfortunately (as of Audacity 1.3.12), you cannot export
      multiple label tracks. If you try to export multiple label tracks
      (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export Labels</strong></span>), they will be merged into a
      single text file, and at import you’ll get a single label track
      containing all the labels from all the tracks.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0064" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can place a label track at the very top and use this like a
      conductor’s score, with notes and timing marks for the whole
      project.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creating and Managing Labels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_and_managing_labels"/>Creating and Managing Labels</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="point_labels_mark_a_single_point_on_a_tr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e12316"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797661.png.jpg" alt="Point labels mark a single point on a track, and region labels mark a section."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-9. Point labels mark a single point on a track, and region

      it, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt;

        this will prevent audio tracks with any offset from aligning to zero.
        Deselect label tracks by <span class="keycap">shift</span>-clicking in their track labels.</p></div><p>Align with Cursor is a fast way to shift a track by a precise
      amount. Here’s how it works: Let’s say you want to insert a time offset
      of 10 seconds at the beginning of your track. Click at the 10-second
      point to mark it, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Align
      Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Align with
      Cursor</strong></span> to move the start of the track to that point. Align
      End with Cursor lines up the end of the track with the cursor.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0087" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0088" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0089" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Align with Selection Start and Align with Selection End are
      similar to Align with Cursor, except the track is moved relative to a
      selection. For example, if you have a selection spanning the 5- to 10-
      seconds segment, Align with Selection End positions the track to begin
      at the 10-second mark. Align with Selection Start moves it the other way
      so that it starts at the 5-second mark.</p><p>Align End with Selection Start/End work the same way, except they
      are relative to the end of the track.</p><p>A slick trick with labels is to create an alignment point when you
      have to time-shift multiple tracks. Use a point label for this: Create
      your point label, click the label text, and a line will extend from the
      label into all tracks above it. Use the Time Shift tool, and the yellow
      Snap Guide will appear when the beginning or end of the track (or
      tracks) is perfectly aligned with your point label.</p><div class="figure"><a id="tracks_1_comma_2_comma_and_4_have_been_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e12672"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797673.png.jpg" alt="Tracks 1, 2, and 4 have been selected."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-15. Tracks 1, 2, and 4 have been selected.</p></div><p>Track alignment can be also made without labels at any arbitrary
      point on the Time Scale. Using the Selection tool, click anywhere in a

      or down into the other tracks by selecting them (<span class="keycap">shift</span>-click in the track labels). <span class="keycap">shift</span>-click also unselects. You can select

<div class="sect1" title="Metronome Track"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="metronome_track"/>Metronome Track</h1></div></div></div><p>The first and best cure for synchronization problems caused by
      slightly different tempos is keeping everyone in time when you make your
      recordings. In other words, the key is prevention. You know those big,
      expensive recording studios, with all the soundproofing and expensive
      gear? They don’t rely on editing wizardry to fix defects any more than
      they have to. That is why they are soundproofed and do multiple takes.
      And that’s why they use metronomes to keep all the players in
      time.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0115" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Metronomes don’t cost much, and every recording studio should have
      one. Like so many other electronic widgets, they come in a monstrous
      array of styles, features, and prices. Just get one has both a silent
      blinking and an audible click beat. If it also includes a tuner, has a
      sine wave generator, receives weather forecasts, and makes sandwiches,
      those are nice bonuses.</p><p>Audacity will make a metronome track for you. It is better to use
      a stand-alone metronome because that doesn’t use any CPU cycles, but
      it’s there if you want it. If you’ve installed the C* Audio Plugin Suite
      (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.de/dsp/caps.html">http://www.de/dsp/caps.html</a>), look in the
      Generate menu for C* Click Metronome. You’ll see a menu like the one in

      set the beats per second, volume, and duration.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Damping</em></span> accepts values from 0.1 to 0.9. Damping
      makes the metronome sound muted at higher damping values and more
      resonant at lower values.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0116" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0117" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Similar to a metronome track is a <span class="emphasis"><em>click

      the beginning of every measure. The pitch of the accented and
      nonaccented beats is controlled by MIDI note number values. MIDI note

      Number 60 is middle C, and there are 12 notes per octave (see <a class="xref" href="ch09s06.html#pitches_and_their_corresponding_midi_not" title="Table 9-1. Pitches and Their Corresponding MIDI Note Number Values">Table 9-1</a> for a MIDI note

        there is always some latency in playback. Ordinarily some latency at
        playback doesn’t matter because we’re just listening, and the sound
        doesn’t have to be synchronized with anything else. But when you’re
        overdubbing, any latency causes the new tracks to be unsynchronized
        with the old tracks. An easy way to demonstrate this is to record
        yourself counting to 10. Then overdub a second track and count to 10
        again while trying to match the first track. Play them back, and most
        likely the second track will not be in sync with the first
        track.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Always have <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt;

The default latency correction value
        is 130 ms, which probably is not correct for your system. You can see
        this correction in action when you’re overdubbing a track, because
        when you stop recording, Audacity will time-shift the new track by
        whatever the latency correction value is. This time shift is indicated
        in the usual way with a pair of arrows on the left side of the
        waveform (<a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#automatic_application_of_latency_correct" title="Figure 9-26. Automatic application of latency correction by time-shifting is indicated by the pair of arrows.">Figure 9-26</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0134" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="automatic_application_of_latency_correct"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e13355"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797695.png.jpg" alt="Automatic application of latency correction by time-shifting is indicated by the pair of arrows."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-26. Automatic application of latency correction by time-shifting
          is indicated by the pair of arrows.</p></div><p>One way to get the correct latency correction value is to use
        trial and error. A simple method is to record a click or metronome
        track and then overdub a vocal track where you try to match the click
        track. Sure, you might feel silly saying “tick tick tick” or “ONE two
        three four” into a microphone, but it works. Make sure that the “Snap
        To” checkbox on the Selection toolbar is not checked and keep
        adjusting the latency value until it sounds right.</p><p>A more precise method is to measure latency using a loopback
        cable. This might sound exotic, but all you’re doing is connecting the
        playback output of your recording interface back to the recording
        input. If it’s an internal sound card, connect the line out to the
        line in. If it’s a USB or FireWire interface, it’s going to depend on
        your device and what kind of connectors it has, but the task is still
        the same—connect playback out to record in.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0135" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Then set Latency Correction to 0. Make sure that the “Snap To”
        checkbox on the Selection toolbar is not checked. Select the “Length”
        radio button, and set the time parameter to hh:mm:ss +
        milliseconds.</p><p>Next, generate a metronome or click track, 30 seconds long, 180
        beats per second. The number of beats per second can be anything; I
        prefer a faster beat because it’s easier to measure.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_overdubbed_track_does_not_line_up_wi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e13374"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797697.png.jpg" alt="The overdubbed track does not line up with the first track because of latency."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-27. The overdubbed track does not line up with the first track

        example, that is 177 ms, which is a lot. If you want, you can zoom way
        in to get the most precise measurement. You’ll probably never get zero
        latency, but you can get close. Latency correction for overdubbing
        always takes a negative value, because the new track always lags
        behind the old track. If you change your recording interface, you
        should repeat the loopback test, because different devices have
        different latencies.</p><p>When you read up on latency, you will find many passionate
        discussions about it and much boasting of heroic low-latency exploits
        such as “I got my latency down to three milliseconds!” That is fine,
        if dubious, but it is good to keep a bit of perspective. It’s no good
        going for super-low latency at the cost of stability or creating skips
        and stutters because your CPU can’t keep up. Latency matters during
        overdubbing, and Audacity helps you with its configurable latency
        correction. It matters when you use software monitoring, which is why
        I prefer using recording interfaces with zero-latency monitoring
        ports. It matters anywhere you have additional stops in your audio
        chain such as outboard special-effects processors. When you play a
        note, you want sound to come out, not lag.</p><p>You can reduce latency in your audio production computer by
        using a high-speed multicore processor and streamlining your computer
        and tuning it for audio production. <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 14</a> tell you how to

        otherwise you’ll probably want to correct this. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Change

        easy, that is, if you know what values to use, and unfortunately
        Audacity does not have a tempo detector. The person who writes a tempo
        detection plug-in will be a big hero. I use a stopwatch and count out
        the beats during playback. It might take a bit of trial and error, but
        it’s usually easier than rerecording.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0138" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>

      concept, and you will want to learn more.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0139" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Frames</em></span> values are for positioning splits
      exactly at video and audio frame borders. Check the “Snap To” box in the
      Selection toolbar, set your time value to the appropriate frame type,
      and then when you make splits or cuts, they will exactly match the
      frames. Any audio outside of the frame borders will be lost and possibly
      create a click.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0140" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0141" class="indexterm"/></p><p>National Television System Committee (NTSC) frames pertain to
      analog broadcast television in North America, some South American
      countries, and a few other countries. The NTSC drop frame rate is 29.97
      frames per second (fps), and the NTSC nondrop frame rate is 30 fps.
      Audacity supports both. Why two? Why the odd 29.97 number? This is an
      old standard dating from the black-and-white TV era. The black-and-white
      broadcast frame rate was true 30 fps, but when color was added to the
      broadcast signal, the frame rate, for various technical reasons, was
      slowed down to 29.97 fps. Now pay close attention, because I am going to
      call on all of my mighty explaining powers to explain the difference
      between drop and nondrop NTSC frame rates in a way that ordinary,
      non-video-engineer mortals can understand. This has never been done in
      the history of humanity; you’re seeing it here first.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0142" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0143" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0144" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0145" class="indexterm"/></p><p>NTSC drop and NTSC nondrop frame rates have only one difference:
      They use different <span class="emphasis"><em>timecodes</em></span> to control the
      playback speed. There is no difference in the length of the program, but
      just a tiny difference in how fast it is played back. The term
      <span class="emphasis"><em>drop</em></span> is unfortunate because it is commonly believed
      that video frames are dropped, but this is not true. Video time is
      measured by counting video frames. When you shoot one hour’s worth of
      video at true nondrop 30 fps, your one-hour project will contain exactly
      108,000 frames. If it is broadcast without first being converted to drop
      frame, it will run about 1 hour and 3.6 seconds, because at a 29.97
      frame rate there are 107,892 frames per hour. So, at the end of an hour,
      there are 108 frames left over.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0146" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you care to do the math, you’ll see that there is a 1 percent
      difference between the two. Naturally this adds up over time, which
      causes woe to broadcasters. It also causes woe to film editors, who need
      to be able to measure cuts and scene lengths accurately.</p><p>This discrepancy is cured by inserting a bit of on-purpose amnesia
      and self-deceit into the drop frame timecode. With NTSC drop frame, your
      film is played at 30 fps, but it pretends to be 29.97 fps because that
      is the requirement for NTSC TV broadcast. Every video frame is counted
      until that 1 percent difference adds up to a whole frame. Then the
      timecode pretends that frame does not exist and does not count it, and
      continues counting on the next frame. So even though your film still has
      its original 108,000 frames, the forgetful timecode plays what it thinks
      are only 107,892 frames in one hour, but it’s really 108,000. Since it
      has fooled itself into not seeing those other 108 frames they get played
      anyway, the film ends on time, and everyone is happy.</p><p>This all sounds complicated and bizarre, but in the
      video-engineering world, it was an elegant solution that caused minimal
      disruption to legacy broadcast infrastructure. The alternative, with the
      advent of color, was to overhaul the entire TV broadcasting system for
      the new color standard.</p><p>All NTSC TV broadcasters require that master tapes submitted to
      them use NTSC drop frame. If you’re editing a film soundtrack in
      Audacity, you can exactly match the correct frame rate.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0147" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0148" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0149" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0150" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Phase Alternating Line (PAL) is the color TV broadcast standard
      for a good portion of the planet: Australia, much of Asia, South
      America, Europe, Greenland, and some African countries. It uses a 25 fps
      frame rate, which Audacity supports.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0151" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Traditional film movies are at 24 fps.</p><p>If you’re making an audio track for DVD, you can use NTSC, PAL, or
      24 fps. For web streaming, you can use whatever frame rates you
      want.</p><p>The Compact Disk Digital Audio (CDDA) frame rate of 75 fps is for
      audio CDs. We learned about this for converting legacy analog media to
      CD in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD">Chapter 3</a>. For
      example, when you copy a vinyl LP into Audacity as one long track and
      then split the track into individual songs, selecting the CDDA frame
      rate ensures that all that splits will match the CDDA frames, and you
      won’t create clicks from the audio being out of sync with the CDDA frame
      rate.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0152" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0153" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0154" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      into a long drum track, creating a backing music track from a short
      clip, or being hypnotically repetitious—whatever pleases you. You’ve
      probably seen low-budget documentaries that used loops to stretch a few
      minutes of music into background soundtracks.</p><p>A simple loop is easy. Start with a single short clip. Select

      appeared in Audacity 1.3.8. The Pan slider does not change your project
      file; it only affects playback in Audacity and how your export will
      sound. Adjust this during playback in Audacity so you can hear exactly
      how your export will sound. This does not work on left or right tracks

        will reduce the amplitude by 3 decibels. So if the maximum amplitude
        is already at -3, this will make it -6. The value -3 is about a
        one-half reduction in volume. That may sound like a lot, but as the
        human ear perceives sound, that is about one step. About the minimum
        change we can detect is 1 dB. This changes your track, so you may
        prefer to use the Gain slider instead. It also changes the amplitude
        only for mixdown and does not alter the original track. Whichever

        This is not quite correct because it is not the same as the signal
        that is sent to the subwoofer port. It’s a special channel for
        carrying sounds in the 3 to 200 Hz range, and the LFE signal can be
        sent to any speaker capable of handling it.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0195" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For DVD-Audio, use the WAV mappings. (See <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Authoring Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs">Chapter 6</a> for more on
        DVD-Audio.) Don’t bother with surround sound for CDs because they only
        support two-channel stereo.</p><p>There are some special problems with creating multitrack
        surround audio in Audacity. Audacity is very good at creating
        high-quality stereo and mono tracks, but its abilities to manage
        multitrack surround are rather limited. You must know the correct
        channel mappings yourself for different file formats because Audacity
        does not tell you, and when you import a multichannel audio file into
        Audacity, it loses the track names and channel mappings even if the
        file was created in Audacity.</p><p>You can test your channel mappings after export by playing your
        new audio file on your computer, if your computer has a multichannel
        surround sound card and it is already set up and working correctly.
        See <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a> to
        learn how to set up and test surround sound playback on Linux
        computers. Windows users will find configuration and testing tools in
        the Sound module of the Control Panel, and Windows Media Player
        supports surround sound.</p><p>Another way to test your new surround sound file is to burn it
        to a DVD and play it on a surround hi-fi system. Yet another way is to
        play the file on a digital music server that serves a surround hi-fi
        system.</p></div></div></body></html>
