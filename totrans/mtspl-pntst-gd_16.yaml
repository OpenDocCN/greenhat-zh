- en: Metasploit’s powerful scripting environment lets you add features or options
    to Meterpreter. In this chapter, you’ll learn the basics of Meterpreter scripting,
    some useful native calls, and learn how to run these commands from within Meterpreter.
    We’ll cover two ways to leverage Meterpreter scripting. The first method is somewhat
    outdated but still important, because not all scripts have been converted. The
    second method is nearly identical to the one discussed in [Chapter 13](part0017.html#building_your_own_module),
    so we won’t cover it in detail in this chapter. (Special thanks to Carlos Perez
    [darkoperator] for his contributions to this chapter.)

    sets up a new handler for us on the return connection. We would not need to set
    this option if we were going to use the same port (for example, 443). Next we

    Meterpreter into the memory space of that process. This allows us to remain stealthy,
    never reading or writing files to disk, while ultimately having multiple shells

    We’ll use a small demo of a module built for bypassing the Windows 7 UAC. Windows
    Vista and later introduced a feature similar to `sudo` in UNIX- and Linux-based
    systems. With this feature, a user is assigned limited account permissions until
    administrative-level permissions are necessary. When the user needs admin rights
    to perform a task, a prompt appears, telling the user that admin rights are required
    and are being used. The ultimate goal of this feature is to protect against a
    compromise or virus infection and to limit exposure only to one user account.

- en: In December 2010, Dave Kennedy and Kevin Mitnick released a new Meterpreter
    module that bypassed the Windows UAC component by injecting a payload into a process
    that had a trusted publisher certificate and was considered “UAC Safe.” When injecting
    into the process, a DLL can be called, running under the context of that UAC Safe
    process, which then executes commands.

- en: In this example, we use the post exploitation modules, which can be used to
    bypass UAC. We first start the *multi/handler* module with the `-j` flag, which
    allows us to accept multiple Meterpreter shells. Notice in this example that when
    we try to run the `getsystem` command, it fails because it is being blocked by
    Windows UAC.

- en: Notice that we can’t bridge over to a system-level account, because UAC is blocking
    us. We need to get around UAC to obtain system-level privileges and ultimately
    become an administrator so that we can further compromise the machine. We press
    ctrl-Z to back out, keeping the session active. Then we use the new format to
    run post modules and bypass the Windows UAC functionality.

    and it would have leveraged the default options and executed without having to
    set up the various options.

  zh: 我们也可以在Meterpreter控制台中执行`run`而不是`use`，它将利用默认选项并执行，而无需设置各种选项。
- en: Notice in the preceding example that we succeed in gaining system-level rights
    on a target machine with UAC enabled. This small example demonstrates how the
    post exploitation modules will ultimately be set up and converted.

- en: We won’t cover all the details of the post exploitation module because it is
    nearly identical to the attack shown in [Chapter 13](part0017.html#building_your_own_module).
    Carefully walk through each line, and then try to build and run your own module.

  zh: 我们不会涵盖后利用模块的所有细节，因为它几乎与第13章中展示的攻击相同[Chapter 13](part0017.html#building_your_own_module)。仔细查看每一行，然后尝试构建并运行你自己的模块。
- en: Walk through existing Meterpreter scripts and look at the different commands,
    calls, and functions that can be used to create your own script. If you come up
    with a great idea for a new script, submit it to the Metasploit development team
    — who knows; it might be a script that others can use!

  zh: 遍历现有的Meterpreter脚本，查看可以用来创建你自己的脚本的不同命令、调用和函数。如果你有一个新脚本的好主意，提交给Metasploit开发团队——谁知道呢；它可能是一个其他人也可以使用的脚本！
