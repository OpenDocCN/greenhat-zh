    source is different: Rather than one business managing everything, everyone pitches

    it helps other people and because they want to help. Everyone can play their part

    his role is to "provide clear leadership on difficult issues and set the pace
    for the project." This doesn't mean that he makes all of the plans and decisions—that's

    Grace Hopper, on retrieving a moth from a relay in one such giant, taped the offending
    insect into her log book and remarked that she had found a "bug" in the computer.
    Well, computers may have changed a lot since the 1940s, but some of the terminology
    hasn't. Whether it's as major as a program crashing or freezing or as minor as
    a missing icon, any problem that you find with a piece of software is still referred

    strongly encouraged to report problems wherever you see them. Developers need
    feedback in the form of bug reports so they know what needs fixing, and problems
    get fixed more quickly if they're reported sooner. Filing a bug report is a relatively
    easy way of giving something back to the community; it doesn't take long, it helps
    to improve the software for everyone, and you get an annoying software problem
    fixed for free!

- en: If your problem fits any of these descriptions, then you likely have a bug on
    your hands! You should be aware of a few notable exceptions, though. First, if
    a program is missing a feature, that's not a bug. You can make a feature request
    using the Brainstorm website (see [Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu](ch20s04.html
    "Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu") in [Sharing Ideas on How to Improve
    Ubuntu](ch20s04.html "Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu")). Second, you shouldn't
    ask for help with software by reporting a bug, since you probably won't get a
    response. Use the forums or IRC instead; find out more on those in [The Ubuntu
    Forums](ch20s05.html "The Ubuntu Forums") in [The Ubuntu Forums](ch20s05.html
    "The Ubuntu Forums") and [Chatting on IRC](ch20s06.html "Chatting on IRC") in
    [Creating Your Own Thread](ch20s05.html#creating_your_own_thread "Creating Your
    Own Thread"). Finally, it's important that the bug is *reproducible*. This means
    that you can provide a set of instructions for someone else to follow, and they
    will experience the same problem as you. Sometimes computers just do one-off weird
    things, so if it's not repeatable, there's little chance that the problem can
    be identified and fixed.

    when you think that there are something like 30,000 packages available for you
    to install. The sheer volume of bugs isn't easy to cope with, and dealing with
    them has been likened to "drinking from a firehose." To calm the chaos, an army
    of volunteers called the Bug Squad pore over all the new bugs, categorizing them,
    identifying ones that have already been reported, asking for details on how the
    bug happens, and generally trying to get enough information together for a developer
    to be able to swoop in and fix the issue. In practical terms, this means it can
    take quite a while for a problem to be fixed, although the actual timescale will
    depend on how important the bug is judged to be. I normally reckon on waiting
    two to three months for an "average" bug. Having said that, my Rhythmbox bug hasn't
    been fixed yet, and it's several years later! (To be fair, it was a particularly
    minor problem that few people are ever likely to experience.)

    go through a series of stringent tests to make sure that they don't screw up anything
