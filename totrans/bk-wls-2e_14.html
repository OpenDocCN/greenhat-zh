This new category of hybrid devices automatically switches between relatively slow EDGE or EV-DO networks with wide coverage areas to much faster Wi-Fi networks whenever it's possible to do so.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1510"/></p><p>Every model has a different set of features and functions, from relatively simple phones that offer limited access to text-based information such as weather forecasts or sports scores, to very sophisticated devices that use an operating system such as Windows Mobile or Palm OS to handle email and web browsing. Many phones double as digital cameras that allow users to send and receive pictures, multimedia players that can store and play music and video, and GPS receivers that offer driving directions.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1511"/>Voice and data <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1512"/>services have come closer to converging <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1513"/>with each advance from first-generation cellular mobile telephone service (analog voice only) through second- and third-generation (2G and 3G) digital services. Depending on the wireless method the service provider uses, many of the latest mobile telephones can send and receive a limited amount of data (such as text messages and pictures) along with the now-traditional voice connections. These are the same wireless methods that support many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1514"/>PDAs and the broadband wireless adapters described in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. ALTERNATIVES TO WI-FI: WIRELESS BROADBAND DATA">Chapter 13</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-27"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>It's also possible to use almost any mobile telephone to connect a portable computer or a PDA to the Internet through a dial-up modem and a special cable, but the connection will be slow and cumbersome because dial-up access is normally limited to a maximum of 56Kbps.

The combination of a telephone, a camera, a text and voice recorder, a music player, an Internet appliance, and a small general-purpose computer in a convenient pocket-size package is a huge advance in the way people use technology. Fifty years ago, having all that technology in your pocket was inconceivable; even 5 or 10 years ago it would have required half a dozen separate devices (and of course, 50 years from now it will all seem impossibly primitive).</p><p>The same Wi-Fi network services that support laptops and desktop computers can also work with handheld devices. One or more access points operate as hubs for the wireless network and double as bridges to the wired portion of a LAN and to the Internet. A single network can include both handheld units and larger computers, so it's entirely practical to use a wireless link to synchronize a PDA with another computer.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-28"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A web search for compact flash or SD Wi-Fi adapters will produce thousands of links, but most of them are several years out of date.

A few manufacturers still make <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1517"/>Wi-Fi adapters on <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1518"/>SD, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1519"/>miniSD, and CompactFlash cards, but they're probably companies you've never heard of, like <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1520"/>SparkLAN (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sparklan.com">http://www.sparklan.com</a>) and Spectec (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.spectec.com.tw">http://www.spectec.com.tw</a>).

Your PDA instruction manual or user's guide should identify the type of network adapter that it needs to connect to a wireless network.</p><p>Some older adapters are still available through the surplus channels, but before you order one, make sure you can find a driver for your PDA's operating system, either on the CD supplied with the adapter or by download from the manufacturer's website. NETGEAR, Linksys, and the other major adapter makers still have drivers and software for their discontinued adapters available for free download, but they probably won't have drivers for more recent operating systems.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="choosing_a_smartphone"/>Choosing a Smartphone</h1></div></div></div><p>The best place to find a new smartphone with broadband wireless access is the service provider whose network you want to use. You can either choose the model you want and look for a service provider that supports it, or you can select a service provider and limit your choices to its list of models. Most mobile telephone companies and wireless service providers have retail stores and websites where you can compare the specific models that are compatible with their networks.</p><p>Because most PDAs and smartphones have small display screens, their designers have squeezed a lot of program icons and other information into a tiny space. This can make it considerably more difficult to operate a handheld device than a full-size computer with a big screen, a mouse, and a keyboard. Of course, there's usually a learning curve that will make any device easier to use over time, but it's still important to try more than one of them before you buy. "Easy to use" is a subjective call that will not be the same for everyone. Some people will be happier with the iPhone's touch screen, while others will prefer a BlackBerry's keyboard or a simple keypad on a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1523"/>Windows Mobile or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1524"/>Symbian device. Your best bet is to visit one or more retail stores and compare several phones with different operating systems, different feature sets, and different physical layouts.</p><p>Every smartphone comes with a basic set of programs, and many others are also available. When you're trying to decide which phone to buy, consider the programs you're likely to use, and be sure to choose a device that either includes those programs with the phone or supports one or more aftermarket programs that fill your requirements.</p><p>It's also important to compare the specific wireless services that each device supports. Does it use a fast EV-DO or EDGE connection, or is it limited to the slower GPRS system? Does it automatically search for a nearby Wi-Fi signal before it connects to a broadband network? Does the service provider offer useful signal coverage in all the places you expect to use the device? Of course, some smartphones are bigger than others. If you plan to carry yours in a pocket rather than a purse or briefcase, a smaller unit might be the better choice.</p><p>Like mobile telephones, each wireless data device has a unique <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1525"/>electronic serial number (ESN) that links that adapter to a specific account. When you buy a smartphone or a PDA with broadband wireless access, you must either set up a new account for your new PDA or transfer an existing account from another device.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-29"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you transfer your phone or PDA from one service provider to another, the new service provider might have to open up your PDA and install a new circuit board with a different ESN</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1526"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="smartphone_operating_systems"/>Smartphone Operating Systems</h2></div></div></div><p>A smartphone is a small mobile computer with an operating system that controls its features and performance, including the screen layout and the way it sends and receives data and telephone calls. The most widely used <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1527"/>smartphone operating systems are <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1528"/>Symbian, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1529"/>Windows Mobile, BlackBerry OS, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1530"/>Palm OS, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1531"/>Apple's OS X for iPhones. Linux-based phones also exist, but they're not common in North America. Each operating system includes a slightly different feature set, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but they all do essentially the same things: They provide the internal software that allows a PDA or smartphone to accept, store, and display text, audio, images, and other data and to communicate through one or more communication channels.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1532"/></p><p>Late in 2007, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1533"/>Google announced that it planned to introduce its own open platform operating system <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1534"/>for smartphones, called <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1535"/>Android, and it invited third-party software developers to create new applications for it. It will be at least a year or two before Android-based smartphones (Googlephones?) reach any real-world consumers, but when they do, Google will probably offer serious competition to Microsoft, Symbian, and the others.</p><p>The Palm, BlackBerry, and iPhone <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1536"/>operating systems are all designed for specific hardware platforms, while Symbian, Windows Mobile, and Linux are more flexible; the hardware manufacturers that use them can choose the specific set of features and functions that they want to offer in each device in their product lines.</p><p>Some smartphones also include a <span class="emphasis"><em>tethered modem</em></span> feature that connects a laptop or other portable computer to the Internet through a cable, using the smartphone's broadband wireless account. This feature is not available on every model or through every service provider, but it can be a convenient alternative to a separate wireless network adapter card and broadband data account. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1537"/>Tethered modem software is supplied with many BlackBerry models, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1538"/>June Fabrics Technology (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.junefabrics.com">http://www.junefabrics.com</a>) offers a similar program called <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1539"/>PdaNet <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1540"/>for Palm OS and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1541"/>Windows Mobile. Depending on your service provider, tethering might require an extra cost per month, and often it will not be as fast as a dedicated broadband modem (for example, EV-DO Rev.

If access to the Internet is an important reason to have a smartphone, you can apply the same criteria that apply to adapters for laptops and other portable computers: Look for a service provider whose coverage footprint includes all the places you're likely to use the device, and look for the fastest possible data transfer speed.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1592"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-1593"/></p><p>A smartphone is often a compromise between the convenience of a single device that works as a telephone and an Internet access device and performs several other functions, with the small size and simplicity of a single-purpose mobile telephone or PDA. The phone's software reflects this compromise.</p><p>Remember that a broadband wireless network doesn't care what kind of data is moving through it or what kind of client device is sending and receiving it. As long as the frames and packets and the radio modulation methods meet the Wi-Fi specifications or they're compatible with the EDGE or EV-DO standards, the network will pass it along. So the same technology that connects your laptop computer to the Internet today will appear tomorrow in embedded modules that perform completely new services. For example, home appliances, office machines, and cars will transmit diagnostic information to central monitoring centers that will identify problems and dispatch a repair technician before the problems become visible to the people using those machines. Pollable water and electric meters will allow a public utility's remote data collector to gather billing information without the need to send a human meter reader to every account location.</p><p>People seem to view smartphones in one of two very different ways: either they cannot imagine the need for such a thing, or they embrace them as a vital part of their daily lives. Many people who use smartphones say that they would never want to give them up. A single pocket-size device that can perform all those functions is enough to spoil them for life—or at least until the next generation of electronic assistants with even more features comes along.</p><p>On the other hand, as Freud might have said, sometimes a phone is just a phone. If telephone calls and maybe the occasional text message are all you need, you don't need the expense and complications of a smartphone.</p></div></body></html>
