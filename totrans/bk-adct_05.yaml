    is determined by your playback devices. The standard CD that plays on all CD players
    is encoded according to the Red Book CD Audio standard. This is what commercially
    recorded CDs use, and this is what you want to use to make a universally playable
    disc. That is no big technical deal, because all you do is choose “Create an audio
    CD” in your CD-writing program. You must always create 16/44.1 WAV files for Red
    Book CDs.

- en: The second type of CD you can make is written to the Orange Book standard to
    play on a computer. Again, this is no big technological deal; it’s just an ordinary
    data CD, and in your CD-writing program you’ll choose “Create a data CD.” On this
    type of disc you may use any audio file format you want, such as FLAC or 24-bit
    WAV for higher quality or lossy, compressed formats like Ogg Vorbis or MP3 to
    cram more songs onto a disc. You are limited only by your choice of software media
    player, and these days it’s a rare software media player that doesn’t support
    everything under the sun.

    players don’t handle them very well. Some don’t even handle CD-Rs well, but that
    is pretty rare anymore. Some newer CD/DVD players support non–Red Book formats
    such as MP3, WAV, and WMA.

    problems reading newer discs. “The older azide-based discs had a very large difference
    in reflectance, and the sensitivity of the player was set to this large difference.
    With CD-RW and the pthalocyanine (silver)–based discs, the difference in reflectivity
    of the 0 and 1 (burned vs. unburned) disc is much smaller.”

    type; there is no such thing as a special audio CD, even though you see them in

    of the Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) to control copying protected material
    and a copying tax that goes to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
    or its equivalent in other countries. The SCMS encoding controls three states:
    copy allowed (00), copy once (11), and copy prohibited (10). It might get in the
    way if you try to use the kind of CD player that attaches to your stereo system
    to copy a copy of a commercial CD. But you can copy the original all you want,
    and computer hardware and media are exempt from being SCSM-compliant.'

    as well. The price difference between the good brands and the not-so-good brands

    every CD player?” They must be converted to 16/44.1 WAV files and then Red Book–encoded.
    To do this, use Audacity to convert MP3s to 16/44.1 WAV format, and then in your
    CD-writing program select “Create an audio CD.” It won’t give you WAV quality;
    it will still be lo-fi, lossy MP3 quality. You won’t get more than 80 minutes
    of music on your disc even with the smaller file sizes. But you’ll have a standard
    CD that will play anywhere.

    means creating a CD that plays one long, unbroken track, like a live show, with
    no breaks between songs. This can be put together from multiple audio files or
    from a single long WAV file. You need a CD burner that supports gapless burning,
    which now should be all CD/DVD burners. Look for session-at-once (SAO) and disc-at-once
    (DAO) support. Track-at-once (TAO) means the laser pauses at the end of each track.
    SAO burns your whole session in one pass with no pauses and leaves the CD open
    so you can add more tracks, while DAO closes the disc. Use SAO or DAO for gapless
    burning of audio CDs.'

    You should end up with two files: a *.bin* file, which contains your audio, and
    a *.cue* or *.toc* file, which contains the disc index. Some CD-authoring applications
    use their own weird nonstandard cue sheet formats; beware of these, because other

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several ways to create a CD compilation in Audacity. One way is to
    copy each song into a single Audacity project, each on its own separate track.
    Edit and apply fixes to each track individually, and then normalization across
    all tracks is a single step. Give each track its own name, and there are your
    song titles. This is a good method for creating a typical audio CD with multiple
    song tracks and a short, silent gap between each one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way is to copy all of your songs into a single stereo Audacity track,
    apply fixes and edits, and then create a label track to divide them into individual
    songs. You can use this to create a CD that appears to be a single long, unbroken
    track by creating nice smooth transitions between each song and then making sure
    there are no gaps between the songs when you burn your CD.

    tracks with two-second gaps, or index the track so that it remains unbroken but

    edit each one individually without worrying about inadvertently changing something
    else. When each song in your project is on its own track, it looks like [Figure 5-1](ch05s03.html#putting_each_song_on_its_own_track

    back in. The little squares are the *node control points*. Create these by clicking
    the track, and then you can move them both horizontally and vertically. To get
    rid of a node, grab a control point and drag it outside the track’s boundary.
    Envelope tools are standard in most audio-editing applications. It takes a bit
    of practice to get the hang of them, but once you figure out how to make them
    go where you want, you gain a high degree of control over fades and amplitude.

    cross-fades are included in the standard add-on plug-in packages, but they’re

    is to create a single Audacity project containing all of your songs. Export to
    your desired format and quality. Then in your CD-writing program, select “Create
    a data CD” instead of creating an audio CD. If you created track metadata, it
    will be displayed in CD players that support it (except for WAV files, which do
    not support storing metadata).

    files to different sampling rates, but this can hurt audio quality. Upsampling
    doesn’t add more quality, just more bits. Downsampling throws away bits. A good
    tactic is not to mix up files in Audacity but rather to edit files that have the
    same sampling rate in a single Audacity project. After export, you can mix and
    match them all you like.

    that is a good one to stick with, though nobody will mind if you experiment with
    the others. The different settings are different levels of compression, with 0
    being the least compression and 8 the most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference
    in quality, only in how much the files are compressed. The value 8 takes several
    times longer to encode than 5 with not much additional benefit. Decoding FLAC
    files that have been maximally compressed doesn’t take any longer than decoding
    ones that have been lightly compressed, so the degree of compression won’t affect

    The value 3 is roughly equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3, which is pretty lo-fi. I think
    6 is good for music. Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling for all levels up to 5,
    which means that redundancies between two stereo channels are combined to save
    bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of stereo imaging. Channel coupling is not
    used at levels 6 and up. I don’t perceive any gain in going greater than 7, though
    your ears may tell you differently.

    bits in certain passages. Variable bitrate operates within a range that you select,
    using more or fewer bits as needed. For my ears, a variable 170 to 210Kbps MP3
    sounds as good as higher-bitrate MP3s, and it sounds better than the lower bitrates

    they might introduce some flaws, lose a bit of fidelity, or introduce some alterations
