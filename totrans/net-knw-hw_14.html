Rather than carrying a copy of each file to the computer connected to the printer on a disk or a flash drive, you can simply click the Print command on your own computer and let the network send it to the printer automatically.</p><p>Even a very small network might include more than one printer. For example, you might use a black-and-white laser printer for routine documents and reports, a color inkjet or laser printer for fancy presentations and school projects, and a special-purpose color printer for digital photos. If you have more than one printer, you can select the best printer for each job. Each of these printers might be located in a different room, close to the person who uses it most often, or in a central room where they're equally accessible to all of your network's users.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_to_connect_a_printer_to_your_networ"/>How to Connect a Printer to Your Network</h1></div></div></div><p>You can connect a printer to a network in several ways: You can use an external printer server, a server built in to your printer, or an automatic switch connected directly to each printer, or you can connect through a computer. All of these methods accomplish the same thing: They send a formatted document or image to a printer that produces a paper copy. The best method for connecting a printer to your network depends on your budget, what's convenient for you, and the layout of your network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1762"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1763"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1764"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1765"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1766"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1767"/></p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="external_printer_servers"/>External Printer Servers</h2></div></div></div><p>An <span class="emphasis"><em>external network printer server</em></span> is a device that connects to the network as a separate network node with an Ethernet port and provides either a parallel port connection or a USB connection to a stand-alone printer. <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#an_external_printer_server_connects_a_p" title="Figure 14-1. An external printer server connects a printer to a network using a parallel port or a USB port.">Figure 14-1</a> shows a printer connected to a network through an external printer server.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1768"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1769"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1770"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1771"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1772"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1773"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1774"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1775"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1776"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="an_external_printer_server_connects_a_p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e15260"/><img alt="An external printer server connects a printer to a network using a parallel port or a USB port." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266438.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-1. An external printer server connects a printer to a network using a parallel port or a USB port.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When you shop for a printer server, look for one that uses the same type of printer port as your printer.

You can run an Ethernet cable to the server unit directly from the hub in the same room or from an unused wall outlet in another room. If you don't have enough Ethernet ports in the room where you want to place the printer server, connect the computer and the printer server to the network through an inexpensive Ethernet data switch, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#if_you_don_apostrophy_t_have_a_spare_ne" title="Figure 14-2. If you don't have a spare network outlet for a printer server, use a small Ethernet data switch.">Figure 14-2</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1780"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1781"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1782"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1783"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="if_you_don_apostrophy_t_have_a_spare_ne"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e15309"/><img alt="If you don't have a spare network outlet for a printer server, use a small Ethernet data switch." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266440.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-2. If you don't have a spare network outlet for a printer server, use a small Ethernet data switch.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When you install Ethernet cables for your home or small business network, consider the locations where you might want to install a printer. Run an extra Ethernet cable between that room and your network hub, and use a wall outlet plate (or surface mount box) with two or more RJ-45 jacks. Use a different color jack for each outlet to make it easier to identify them at a glance.</p></div><p>Adding a printer server to your network is similar to adding a computer, except that you'll have to configure the printer server remotely from a computer. The usual routine is to connect the server to the network and the printer to the server and then use a web-based configuration utility to set the server's network address and other options. Follow the instructions supplied with the server to load the printer driver.</p><p>Another advantage of using a printer connected directly to the network is that it operates independently of the other computers on the network. When a printer connects through a computer, that computer must be on all the time or you have to create a "public" account that the rest of the family or office can use to print. This setup is a lot less secure than printing through a server.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="wi-fi_printer_servers"/>Wi-Fi Printer Servers</h2></div></div></div><p>If your network already includes a Wi-Fi access point, you can use a Wi-Fi printer server to connect your printer to the network. The printer server should automatically detect the Wi-Fi signal from your access point and establish a two-way connection (data in and printer status out) between the printer and the computer that originated the print request. The Wi-Fi link should use all the same security tools (such as WPA encryption) as your other Wi-Fi connections.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1784"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1785"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1786"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1787"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1788"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1789"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1790"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1791"/></p><p>A Wi-Fi printer shares the same wireless channel with other Wi-Fi links on your network, so a large document might slow down the network's performance, but slow performance is not likely to be an issue unless your network carries a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of traffic.

They're often a bit more expensive than the combination of a low-end, stand-alone printer and a separate printer server device, because they're generally more durable printers with more and better features. But if your network's users print enough pages to justify a workgroup printer, the added cost will often pay for better performance.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="automatic_printer_switches"/>Automatic Printer Switches</h2></div></div></div><p>When two or more of your computers are located in the same room or adjacent rooms, an automatic printer switch might be a less expensive alternative to a network printer server. As the name suggests, an automatic switch detects print requests from two or more input connectors and automatically forwards them to the printer, and the switch returns status information from the printer back to the computer that originated the request. When it receives more than one print request at the same time, the printer switch sends the first one to the printer and holds the other requests in a buffer until the first one has completed printing. As far as each computer attached to the switch is concerned, the printer is connected directly to that computer.</p><p>A printer switch is less practical when the computers on your network are in rooms that are far apart, because a cable must run from each computer to the switch.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_a_computer_as_a_printer_server"/>Using a Computer as a Printer Server</h2></div></div></div><p>The alternative to a printer server for a network that extends beyond more than one or two rooms is to connect the printer directly to one of the network computers and send print requests from all the other computers through that one.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1797"/></p><p>This approach has several advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You can use any printer connected to your computer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You don't need a separate printer server device or a printer with a built-in network server.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You can locate a printer anywhere, not just where you have a free network port or outlet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On a network where different users have different types of printers (such as laser and inkjet, color and black-and-white, or special formats for photos or large documents), using a computer as a printer server allows everyone to take advantage of each printer's features.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You don't need an additional port on the network hub or router.</p></li></ul></div><p>On the other hand, this approach also has a few possible drawbacks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The computer acting as a printer server must be turned on whenever anybody wants to print; this could be a security issue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When the printer begins to print without warning, it could distract the person using the computer connected to the printer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As other users come into the office or workspace where the printer is located to collect their print jobs, this can be yet another distraction for the operator of the computer acting as a printer server.</p></li></ul></div><p>If your network also uses a dedicated file server, you can eliminate the security and distraction issues by using the same computer as your network's printer server. Or if you have an older computer collecting dust in a closet, you can use it as a stand-alone printer server (although you might have to add a network interface and maybe a USB port on plug-in expansion cards). However, the most common way to use a computer as a printer server is to connect the printer to an existing computer and direct print commands from all the other computers in the network to print through the server.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1798"/></p><p>In Windows, setting up a printer server is a three-step process, described in the following sections.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="turning_on_printer_sharing_on_the_netwo"/>Turning on Printer Sharing on the Network Card</h3></div></div></div><p>Follow these steps to turn on printer sharing on your network interface:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1799"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1800"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1801"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1802"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1803"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1804"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1805"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>From the Control Panel, select <span class="strong"><strong>Network Connections</strong></span>.

Some all-in-ones can also send images through the Internet as email attachments.</p><div class="figure"><a id="an_all-in-one_device_can_obtain_images"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e15825"/><img alt="An all-in-one device can obtain images from different sources and send them to any of several destinations." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266450.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-7. An all-in-one device can obtain images from different sources and send them to any of several destinations.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Each of the all-in-one's activities is a specific combination of input and output:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scanning</strong></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>Goes from a scanned image to a computer file</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Copying</strong></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>Goes from a scanned image to a printed page</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Printing</strong></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>Goes from a computer file to a printed page</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Incoming fax</strong></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>Goes from a telephone line to a printed page or computer file</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Outgoing fax</strong></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>Goes from a scanned image or a computer file to a telephone line</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Computers connected to the network treat an all-in-one device like each of the separate devices. The printer shows up in the menu that Windows, Mac OS, or Linux/Unix displays when you want to print a document; like any other printer, you must add it to each computer's printer list and load a printer driver on that computer. The scanner uses either a TWAIN or WIA interface to import images directly into application programs, and fax programs detect the all-in-one as a fax machine. The copier function sends the scanned image directly to the printer, so it doesn't show up on the network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1833"/></p><p>An all-in-one that is not intended for full network operation can still operate as a networked printer. However, it's possible that the scanner and fax functions will only work from the computer connected directly to the all-in-one unit. As a rule of thumb, you can assume that an all-in-one that connects directly to the network through an Ethernet port will support all of its functions from any computer on the network. But if the unit connects to a printer through a USB port, it might not accept commands from remote computers.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1834"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-1835"/></p><p>Installing an all-in-one is like installing a printer: Connect the USB connector to the computer you want to use as a printer server, or connect the Ethernet port directly to the network hub or router. If the server doesn't automatically detect the all-in-one device, load the software supplied with the device. If all else fails, follow the installation instructions supplied with the all-in-one device.</p></div></body></html>
