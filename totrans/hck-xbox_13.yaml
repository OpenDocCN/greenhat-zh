- en: The state of the art in Xbox hacking is constantly advancing. Thousands of hackers
    are constantly researching, innovating, discovering, and sharing new methods and
    techniques for making the Xbox a more useful and valuable piece of hardware to
    its end users. Keeping abreast of the latest developments in hacking can be overwhelming.
    Hopefully, reading this book has given you the faculties to understand the latest
    posts and news on various websites and web fora dedicated to Xbox hacking. This
    chapter discusses where you can go to find out more about the latest hacks, where
    to ask for help, and how you can contribute your unique abilities and perspective
    to the community. This chapter also discusses some of the larger challenges that
    will face hackers in the future, namely the trusted PC initiatives.

    in touch and sharing information through various Internet “fora” (fora is the
    plural of forum, as data is the plural of datum). Most of the Xbox hacking community
    keeps a low profile, and hackers often use pseudonyms to protect their identities.
    The reasons for using pseudonyms varies, but in general anonymity carries the
    benefit of greater operating freedom. Hackers are more inclined to share their
    results and findings if they know they can back away unscathed in case things
    get ugly. The use of pseudonyms also levels the playing field. Hackers judge each
    other primarily on the basis of the quality and frequency of their contributions,
    and little else. The fact that you may be young does not detract from your first
    impression or street credibility, as it might in other situations. Likewise, many
    hackers have no qualms about being blunt when you’ve made an error, and they have
    even less patience for stupidity presented as erudition or rude assertions. On
    the other hand, many hackers are more than happy to extend a hand to those who
    have made an honest effort to read the FAQs, search the web and general y try
    their best to check and make sure that the question hasn’t already been answered.

    of writing Google started indexing a number of resources for replacement Xbox
    components. This can be useful for those who do not want to go through the trouble

    today’s top hit on Google for “Xbox hacking” is a LWN.net article titled “LWN:
    Lindows CEO funds Xbox hacking contest (News.com).” This seems fairly removed
    from information about how to install a new hard drive or the details about the

    example, I really enjoy hardware, especially when it requires building something.
    Also, while I can write code, I don’t particularly enjoy it. Thus, my contribution
    to the hacking community is primarily through hardware projects. Likewise, I have
    a hard time motivating myself to engage in software projects. So, most of the

- en: For some time, I had been interested in electronics hacking, though for the
    most part my interest had been limited to merely reading about such feats. Hacked
    devices such as Sega’s Dreamcast and the Netpliance I-Opener had caught my attention
    from time to time. However, my first real experience with electronics hacking
    came with the “ePods,” a discontinued internet appliance/web-tablet device. I
    read about these interesting devices online and found my way to Ken Segler’s I-Appliance
    BBS (http://www.linux-hacker.net), home of the famous I-Opener hacks. After reading
    about the neat things people were doing with these tablets, I was intrigued and
    spent a good deal of my saved up money at the time ($200) on one of the units.
    After receiving my new toy, I spent a lot of time performing many of the documented
    hacks, mostly software based. This was to be my first glimpse into the world of
    electronics hacking. After the ePods, I moved on to another internet appliance,
    the Gateway Connected Touchpad. A slick-looking 10" touchscreen with a 400MHz
    Crusoe and 96MB RAM housed behind it; it looked like a great deal and perfect
    for a fun project. The device ran a custom build of Linux for AOL off of a 32MB
    CompactFlash card. I swapped this out with a Microdrive and after much swapping
    of this disk between laptops and USB readers and the Gateway, the device booted
    a pared down version of Windows using “98Lite.” The device seemed perfect for
    use as a finger-operated, network-attached mp3 jukebox (among other things) so
    I began working on a custom player that would allow easy operation via the touchpad.
    The whole Gateway experience made for a neat summer project between my Junior
    and Senior years of high school.

- en: It was during this time period that I got the idea for XboxHacker.Net. To me,
    the Xbox seemed to have the potential to be the ideal computing device for under
    the TV . . . as soon as it could be programmed. The hardware was most impressive
    for the time, and more than adequate for what I hoped would be accomplished on
    the device. Unlike other consoles, the Xbox also was to have a hard drive and
    ethernet port built in. Once hacked, the Xbox could be used to emulate old consoles
    such as NES, SNES, N64, and even PSX, to conveniently play back any type of media
    file, such as mp3s or DivXs, on your home entertainment system, to play streamed
    media from a home network, or even to double as a basic PC. Some argued that the
    cost of the device at $299 made it out of range to bother hacking, as a PC with
    similar specs could be constructed without the need for hacking for not much more
    in cost. However, the Xbox had the advantage that it could also play Xbox games
    and was already designed to sit with your TV. The hacks would just be added value.
    After my short foray into the world of electronics hacking, I thought that hacking
    the Xbox could be an interesting project to help organize as I was intrigued by
    the possibility of having a convenient box for my TV to perform the tasks mentioned
    above. It was not until many months later that I would actually acquire the XboxHacker.Net
    domains.

    Internet to discuss any material related to hacking the Xbox and the XboxHacker.Net
    news page had the most upto-date news on the status of the Xbox. A few weeks after
    the site came online, it received mention in an article on CNET, and from then
    on the activity level steadily increased. It wasn’t long before XboxHacker.Net
    had outgrown the small shared server we were on, so the site moved to a much larger
    account which was also outgrown in a matter of weeks. Traffic to the forums continued
    to increase rapidly, so I made the decision to move the site to its own dedicated

    tool I had received without much explanation that showed “security sectors” on
    the disks. The second instance was a request to remove a link someone had posted
    in the forums to a BIOS image of the Xbox. Aside from these few minor incidents,
    contact between Microsoft and XboxHacker.Net was virtually non-existent. It was

    Web-pages contained a plethora of information on file formats and other valuable
    tidbits of Xbox information. Steve “SurferDude” Gehlbach contributed to the design
    of a VGA converter circuit for the Xbox and Ken Gasper improved on this to create
    a true VGA adapter for the Xbox. Bunnie’s early analysis and hardware info page
    generated interest in XboxHacking as well after its appearance on Slashdot. Indeed,
    there are numerous others who made their mark as well. Privileged to count such

    and discuss ideas with fellow hackers and also served to bring together many talented
    hackers who may otherwise have had no means of collaborating. It was a great feeling
    to watch the progress that the forums enabled. One particular discussion that

    were discussing the new security system in the second generation Xbox, looking
    for flaws and ways around it. It was exciting to watch the events unfold as hackers
    got closer to the solution and eventually broke the security on the revised Xbox.

    of modchips near summer 2002\. By this time, the Xbox security system had been
    cracked by multiple groups and it was only a matter of time before modchips were
    readily available to the public. At this point, the work shifted away from hardware
    hacking for the most part and more towards software development. A sister site
    to XboxHacker.Net, XboxDeveloper (http://www.xboxdeveloper.net) was started to
    help catalog the software that became available for the Xbox, though it never
    took off to the level that XboxHacker.Net did. Using leaked copies of the Microsoft
    Xbox SDK, programmers began writing and porting various applications for the Xbox,
    including media players and emulators such as MAME. The Xbox-Linux project (http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/)
    under the leadership of Michael Steil, successfully allowed the Linux operating
    system to run on the Xbox. I pushed to start the OpenXDK project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openxdk/),
    an open source developer kit that would allow development of software for the
    Xbox unhindered by legal issues, though that project has met with only mixed success.
    It is now under the leadership of “Caustik” (Aaron Robinson), a CS student at
    Case Western University. Due to the more accessible nature of software development
    compared with hardware hacking, the number of contributing members to the general
    XboxHacking effort increased rapidly. The amount of “homebrew” software available
    for the Xbox today is amazing and includes everything from media players, console
    emulators, and utilities to originally written games.

    Robinson）领导，他是凯斯西储大学的一名计算机科学学生。由于软件开发与硬件破解相比更具可访问性，为XboxHacking贡献的成员数量迅速增加。今天可用的Xbox“自制”软件数量惊人，包括媒体播放器、控制台模拟器、实用程序以及原创游戏。

    to building a trustable computer, from the Automated Teller Machine model of physical
    security and tamper-resistance, to less hardware intensive solutions such as those
    used in the Xbox. The Xbox fits into the broader picture of trusted computing

    of trusted clients in an ad-hoc network like the Internet harbors the promise
    of enabling safe and private on-line financial transactions, of reducing or eliminating
    the occurrence of computer viruses, and of reducing or eliminating spam email.
    Trusted PCs can also be used to securely store sensitive data, such as your medical
    and financial records and your naughty or embarrassing secrets. Another application
    of trusted PCs is to reliably enforce digital content access rights and management
    policies upon users. The digital rights management (DRM) aspect of trusted computing
    could fundamentally change the way we use computers today; many of us enjoy the
    benefits of pseudo-free content and flexible copyright implementations. The fundamental
    problem is not the existence of content management policies — indeed, content
    management policy can be beneficial for consumers. The real problem is when the
    policies which govern your rights can be set unilateral y by content providers.
    In the current trusted PC proposals, the user is not trusted to have control over
    certain key secrets inside their machines. Instead, the attestation information
    (information required to establish trustability) of a user’s machine is partial
    y maintained by a third party. Can we rely on a non-elected, unregulated third
    party with business interests to determine who can do business, send email, and
    otherwise be recognized as a trustable entity?

    in practice, systems will be deployed with preset rights, policies and third-party
    trust affirmation resources pointed in the wrong direction for consumers. A company,
    during good times, may set the privacy and security policy in favor of users to
    attract a larger customer base, but once Chapter 11 comes knocking, or the company
    is sold or otherwise changes hands, these policies can and will shift. What is
    to prevent businessmen from promoting trusted computing initially with user-friendly
    policies, and then suddenly shifting into a wallet-squeezing DRM mode? Ethics?

    days of computing, machines were so expensive that the hardware necessary to enforce
    strong trust policies was not within the reach of consumers. For example, many
    early machines shipped with a socket for a hardware Memory Management Unit (MMU)
    chip. The MMU was one of the first steps toward trustable hardware memory models;
    part of an MMU’s job is to enforce page-level memory access protections. MMUs
    were sold as an option because they were quite pricey at the time. Unfortunately,
    the move toward trustable hardware stopped at the MMU, partially because computer
    networks didn’t exist in any major form until relatively recently. In a non-networked
    world, data needed to be protected only from programmer errors and from access
    by a few select users with physical access to the machine. Today, computers need
    something stronger than just an MMU, something that can provide trust in the face
    of viruses and remote attackers attempting to exploit subtle software weaknesses
    to run malicious code.

- en: The natural extension to the MMU’s hardware-enforced paged virtual memory model
    might be address capabilities with a tagged memory model. A memory tag is a set
    of bits that record the type of data or code stored in a memory location. In a
    tagged memory model, every memory location has a set of tag bits, kind of like
    how every memory location in a conventional error-correcting memory implementation
    is associated with some ECC bits. Tag bits help the hardware enforce data type
    management policies; for example, a memory location tagged as piece of data can
    never be accidentally or intentionally executed as code. A capability is a pointer
    granted by a trusted kernel that cannot be forged. The unforgeability property
    is preferably enforced by hardware through tag bits. Many architectures also include
    the ability to enforce access boundaries as part of a hardware capability.¹ Capabilities
    and memory tags are not new ideas; in 1961, the Burroughs B5000 used capabilities
    (then called descriptors) and tagged memory to guard, in hardware, against buffer
    overflow attacks, and to isolate code from data.² The MIT PDP-1, Intel i432, IBM
    System/38, and the Mach and Amoeba operating systems also implemented capabilities
    in some form, and this is by no means a complete list of systems that have used
    capabilities or tagged memory. The security properties of capabilities have also
    been demonstrated in many academic studies, such as the EROS (Extremely Reliable
    Operating System).³ Unfortunately, capabilities and tagged memory never made their
    way into the heart of mainstream PC architecture. Security and reliability has
    always taken a back seat to cost, backward-compatibility, and performance.

    the cryptographic approach that is being proposed today by Palladium and the Trusted
    Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA). In fact, cryptography on its own does not
    provide any security. Secure key management is really what provides all the security

    key. Both require a trusted OS to manage their creation, dissemination and destruction.
    Both are equally weak if the system cannot protect against forged keys or capabilities.
    The big difference is that if a secret key leaks, all security is lost, eternally.
    On the other hand, capabilities are created and destroyed dynamically, so the
    leakage of a capability might lead to a security breach, but the scope and duration
    of the breach is limited. To this extent, capabilities provide a more robust solution
    for computer security.

    to ensure that no internal kernel structures are ever accessible to user processes,
    even in the presence of bugs and memory leaks (including scenarios where kernel
    memory is deallocated and reassigned to a user process without a memory clearing
    step). This scheme can also be used to establish security audit trails which are
    useful for helping programmers to trace the root cause of a security breach, and
    as damage control measures in case of a security breach.

    is that if a rogue does get hold of data through some hardwares means — by eavesdropping
    on the hardware or stealing a hard drive — the data cannot be deciphered. However,
    users can elect to use cryptography for data protection in any computer implementation,
    including those using hardware capabilities and tagged memory. The problem of
    secure key management is still a difficult problem, but perhaps it can be solved
    in part by integrating cryptographic smart card readers into PCs.

    cryptographic techniques proposed in Palladium and TCPA. The techniques reviewed
    in this section, namely capabilities and tagged memory, can be used to implement
    a secure, trustable PC in a manner that does not involve the risk of users losing
    the ability to set their own access policies. Users would be in full control of
    their machine and their secrets at all times.

    Microsoft’s Pal adium and the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA). There
    are enough similarities between the two proposals that many people think they
    are one and the same, but the goals of each initiative are different.

- en: The TCPA is a multi-corporation alliance to create computers with some nominal
    amount of trust. Significantly, much of its specifications can also be applied
    to non-PC platforms. In TCPA the trust is planted in a secure hardware module
    called the TPM (Trusted Platform Module). The TPM contains features to ensure
    that the secrets contained within the module are never leaked through software
    attacks. It also contains features, such as secured system “measurements,” that
    attempt to transfer the trust contained within the TPM to the host machine.

    created by Microsoft alone. One of its components is a TPM-like security module,
    but Palladium also calls for sweeping changes to the hardware chipset and the
    way I/O ports are implemented. The chipset is required to enforce memory security
    policies from all potential DMA sources, such as the graphics card. Palladium
    also calls for encryption of the I/O to the keyboard and video subsystems.

    is a potentially large flaw. There isn’t enough margin in the commodity PC hardware
    industry today to support the overhead of an extensive cryptographic security
    overhaul. Too, many chipset vendors do not have any experience with implementing
    secure systems. On top of the language barrier faced by many overseas chipset
    vendors, chipsets are usually developed on a short fuse and with a keen eye on
    the pocketbook. Can chipsets developed under these conditions be expected to protect
    sensitive secrets?

    by one body and implemented by another very different organization. Microsoft
    wrote a specification for a trustable piece of hardware, namely, the Xbox. Strong
    cryptographic algorithms are used liberally in the Xbox, and the master key for
    the system is locked deep inside a complex piece of silicon. However, experience
    has demonstrated that the Xbox’s security system can be bypassed using a combination
    of an unsecured debug port, a flaw in the hardware initialization scheme, and
    a bug in the handling of a boundary case of the instruction pointer in the CPU.
    These three minor oversights, committed by three independent parties (the assembly
    contractor, the Xbox firmware designer, and Intel), conspire to provide a convenient
    method for defeating Xbox security.

    problem. This leads to the disconcerting question of how many security breaches
    in a particular Palladium implementation will be caused by the stacking of multiple
    benign flaws. Every complex consumer electronics system has minor bugs or design
    oversights, especially when systems are composed of components built by multiple
    independent entities whose primary interest is in turning a profit.

    or one can make money. Products that don’t make money are quickly cancelled. Thus,
    it is very rare to find a consumer product that is technically perfect in all
    respects. As a result, the only practical way to guarantee the security of consumer
    electronics system as complex as Palladium is to throw it into the wild, and let
    the hackers have their way with it for many years until all of the big security
    holes have been discovered and plugged.

    of problems that is smaller in scope than Palladium’s. Thus, the TPM is not as
    exciting from a market perspective, but it may be more practical and serviceable
    for its intended purpose. Both the TPM and Palladium are weak to hardware attacks,
    but the TPM doesn’t attempt to extend security requirements as far into third-party
    system design territory. The TPM is primarily a secured key management module
    that can detect most modifications and intrusions to the host system. The software
    layers built on top of this substrate do the rest of the heavy lifting, *caveat
    emptor*.

- en: The first attack is one that I call the “**S**urre**p**titious B**IOS,** ” or
    SPIOS (pronounced “Spy OS”) attack. SPIOS can be used to defeat DRM policies that
    rely on the cryptographically sealed storage feature of the trusted PC to prevent
    unauthorized user access to data. The basic idea is to boot the PC with an unmodified
    BIOS into trusted mode and extract all the desired data into system RAM, then
    to perform a warm reset of the system while swapping the BIOS image.
  id: totrans-53
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The modified BIOS image can be used to read out the desired data from system
    RAM. The desired data may be a session key stored in memory, or the actual decrypted
    data itself, depending upon how the program structures and caches its data in
    memory. Since the current trusted PC specifications call for an LPC bus based
    BIOS, inexpensive alternate firmware devices (similar to those used on the Xbox)
    can be used to execute this attack. There are techniques that application programmers
    can use to complicate this attack, such as only decrypting a single block of data
    each time into system memory, but many of these techniques severely degrade system
    performance. The degradation of system performance may be especially pronounced
    if file caching and prefetching is disabled.

- en: Another attack is one that I cal the **“S**urre**p**titious R**AM**,” or SPAM
    attack. The goal of this attack is to spoof the trusted routines responsible for
    measuring the fitness of the system state. A device, such as an FPGA or ASIC,
    is installed on the plug-in memory cards in between the DRAM chips and the memory
    connector. This device monitors the pattern of addresses going by, or it may have
    an extra connector that sniffs the state of the wires connected to the I/O pins
    of the cryptomodule responsible for authenticating the system.

    a memory image that is consistent with an unmodified, trusted system state. However,
    during all other operating modes, the SPAM device presents a memory image that
    is modified to do whatever the user pleases. This modification can be very subtle:
    Just a couple of bits flipped at the right locations is all it takes to modify
    key branch instructions in the security kernel.'
  id: totrans-56

- en: This device is more powerful than the SPIOS since it works on a system that
    is powered-up and supposedly trustworthy. It can be applied to effectively defeat
    a wider range of DRM schemes as well as some authenticated transactions between
    the local machine and the server. SPAM alone cannot be used, however, to falsely
    identify a system as another registered, trusted system, since SPAM lacks the
    secret shared between the tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule in the local machine
    and the authentication server. False system identification would require either
    extracting the key from a tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule (possible, but
    not trivial and most likely destructive to the module), or somehow tricking a
    secure cryptomodule from another registered, trusted machine into providing the
    falsified identity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The SPAM device can be manufactured for relatively little (high performance
    FPGAs can cost as little as $50 today in single quantities), and can be very easy
    to install. The SPAM can be either integrated directly into a memory module (in
    which case it functions as both a trust violation device and as a memory expansion
    device), or it can be provided as a device that is installed in a stacked configuration
    in between the motherboard’s memory slot and the existing memory device. In some
    memory card configurations, particularly ones that employ heat shields, it may
    be possible to hide the SPAM device and pass the module off as a regular memory
    expansion device. While elaborate, this may be a worthwhile attack against a large
    corporation or bank that stores high-value secrets on a trusted PC-based server.

    circuits is driving greater integration throughout the PC. Within a decade, today’s
    PC will fit on a single piece of silicon. Once the RAM and the BIOS are fully
    integrated into a single piece of silicon, hacking a system becomes much more
    difficult — but not impossible. Focused Ion Beam (FIB) machines, a tool used by
    chip designers and failure analysis labs, can cut and jumper nano-scale features.
    Another upside for for trusted machine designers is that public key processors
    could become so small and cheap to integrate into a chip that individual chips,
    especially memory chips, could start using strong crypto to authenticate and encrypt
    their I/O.

    tamper-resistant or tamper-detecting features. For example, a time-domain reflectometer
    (TDR) could be built into a chip’s I/O cells. A TDR can detect the presence of
    an eavesdropper on a wire by recognizing certain changes to the wire’s electrical
    properties. In addition to the ability to detect eavesdroppers, integrated TDR
    devices are desirable for high performance I/O since they can be used to calibrate
    the drive impedance and equalization/pre-emphasis filters required for multi-gigabit
    speed communications.
