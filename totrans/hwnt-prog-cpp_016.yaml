- en: A hacker received an assignment to write a program that simulated a four-function
    calculator. The assignment called for a program that could add, subtract, multiply,
    and divide. However, the assignment didn't specify what type of numbers, so the
    hacker's program worked with Roman numerals (IV + III = VII). A users' manual
    was also required, but the assignment didn't say what language, so the programmer
    supplied an extensive manual - written in Latin.
