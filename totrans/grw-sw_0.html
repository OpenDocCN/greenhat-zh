    in the unique position of having to deal with the technical team and other
    senior managers, while simultaneously taking direction from the CEO. Too
    often, development managers focus only on technology, even though the
    nontechnical aspects of the job can have the biggest impact on a company's
    success. As your company grows, problems that once seemed small can grow
    accordingly, exploding into major disasters. I wrote <span class="emphasis"><em>Growing
    Software</em></span> to offer advice for newer development managers about
    how to succeed when faced with these diverse challenges.</p><p>The role of a development manager at a small company differs from
    the same role in a large and stable company in many ways. For example, the
    development manager at a small company must often work with developers to
    support an immature product. Development managers must also work with the
    strong personalities who are attracted to the challenges faced by growing
    companies. But most of all, a small company's development manager must
    have a wide focus that includes employees, product, process, planning,
    technology, and customers.</p><p>In contrast, large companies typically support multiple existing
    products, and their processes are usually well defined and relatively
    static. Policies in large companies typically limit the choices of tools,
    techniques, and approaches that a development manager can use. The
    manager's role is more specific and much narrower in scope than the same
    role in a small firm.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Growing Software</em></span> serves as a practical,
    hands-on guide for development managers at small companies that have moved
    past the initial survival stage and are trying to grow. It is intended to
    help the manager look ahead and deal with problems before they become
    unwieldy. The techniques described here are useful for small firms
    producing software for sale or for a software-as-a-service offering; they
    are not directed at software consulting businesses. <span class="emphasis"><em>Growing
    Software</em></span> provides general advice, specific solutions, and
    detailed templates and spreadsheets to help development managers put
    general concepts into direct action.</p><p>Because the scope of the book is broad, it is written in a
    prescriptive style rather than an argumentative one—that is, many
    recommendations are not supported by exhaustive arguments as to why the
    techniques work well. Although this information would have greatly
    increased the scope of the book, it would have made it less
    readable.</p><p>For convenience, I use the terms <span class="emphasis"><em>development
    manager</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>development management</em></span>
    throughout this book to describe the <span class="emphasis"><em>top</em></span>
    software/engineering manager—whether the particular job title is chief
    technology officer (CTO), vice president of engineering, director of
    engineering, or senior engineering manager. This person manages software
    engineers, but he or she might also manage quality assurance,
    documentation, and project management groups. Although the target audience
    for this book is the person in charge of all of development, nontechnical
    managers will also be interested in the problems and solutions described
    here.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="book_organization_and_conventions"/>Book Organization and Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is divided into the following major sections that make

        growth mode. The information in this book applies to one or more of
        these stages. <a class="xref" href="pr02.html#stages_of_startup_company_growth" title="Table 1. Stages of Startup Company Growth">Table 1</a>

        real-world situations that illustrate key points; these narratives are
        offset from the rest of the text. Although all accounts are written in
        first person for consistency, the stories are a mix of the experiences
        of others as well as my personal experiences. Company and individual
        names have been removed.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="spreadsheets"/>Spreadsheets</h2></div></div></div><p>Spreadsheet examples are used throughout to illustrate
        techniques for collecting, analyzing, and displaying information to
        solve specific types of problems. Each is illustrated and described in
        the text and can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nostarch.com/growingsoftware.htm">http://www.nostarch.com/growingsoftware.htm</a> to be used
        in Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc, adjusting for each
        program's minor differences. The primary purpose of the examples is to
        teach how to analyze and solve underlying problems with a simple
        spreadsheet.</p><p>Although the spreadsheets can be used as is, many problems will
        require that you customize the basic spreadsheet layout. You can
        re-create a spreadsheet by typing all the fields into a spreadsheet
        program. Arrows point to particular cells to indicate a formula you
        can enter, with a description to the right or below the example. As
        appropriate, copy the formula across a row or column as described in
        the note attached to the spreadsheet. <a class="xref" href="pr02.html#this_sample_spreadsheet_illustrates_cell" title="Figure 1. This sample spreadsheet illustrates cell instructions.">Figure 1</a> illustrates
        these conventions.</p><p>When entering formulas, pay attention to dollar sign ($)
        characters that affect how a formula reads data when it is copied from
        one cell to another. Not including the dollar sign character can
        result in incorrect calculations after the formulas are copied.</p><div class="figure"><a id="this_sample_spreadsheet_illustrates_cell"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e190"/><img alt="This sample spreadsheet illustrates cell instructions." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266057.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. This sample spreadsheet illustrates cell
          instructions.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Correct formatting is also important for the spreadsheet
        examples. The default format for an entry is General, which will not
        display all values in the most appropriate ways. Formatting is implied
        from the examples: <span class="emphasis"><em>Dates</em></span> should use Date
        formatting; <span class="emphasis"><em>currency</em></span> amounts should use Currency
        formatting with zero digits after the decimal; and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>numbers</em></span> should use Number formatting with the
        rounding chosen based on how many digits are of interest.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="important_differences_between_excel_and_"/><p class="title"><b>Important Differences Between Excel and OpenOffice.org
          Calc</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>OpenOffice.org Calc uses a semicolon (;) to separate
              fields in a formula, and Microsoft Excel uses a comma (,). This
              book uses commas to separate fields in all formulas. If you are
              working in Calc, use semicolons instead. For example, the Excel
              formula <span class="emphasis"><em>=WORKDAY(B3, C3)</em></span> looks like this in
              Calc: <span class="emphasis"><em>=WORKDAY(B3; C3)</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A second important difference is the <span class="emphasis"><em>inter-sheet
              reference</em></span> used to refer to cells in other worksheets.
              The inter-sheet reference is an exclamation point (!) in Excel
              but a period in Calc. For example, a formula that references the
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Eng</em></span> sheet appears in Excel as
              <span class="emphasis"><em>=Eng!H3</em></span> but appears as
              <span class="emphasis"><em>=Eng.H3</em></span> in Calc.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="templates"/>Templates</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Growing Software</em></span> also provides sample
        templates, surrounded by a dashed box, that you can copy as starting
        points for your own templates. Template instructions appear in
