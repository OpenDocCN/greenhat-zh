<p class="docText1"><a name="PHP " class="calibre8" id="PHP "/>PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that can be embedded into HTML. It is commonly used to create dynamically generated websites and is the foundation of applications like WordPress (blogging software), MediaWiki (which underlies Wikipedia), and phpBB (a web-based bulletin board system). PHP is also known for its easy integration with relational database management systems. These applications all use a combination of PHP and a relational database system like MySQL.<a name="IDX-CHP-20-0304" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0304"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0305" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0305"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0306" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0306"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0307" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0307"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0308" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0308"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0309" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0309"/><a name="IDX-CHP-20-0310" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-20-0310"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="executes functions" class="calibre8" id="executes functions"/>Unlike JavaScript, which executes functions in a user's web browser, PHP handles functions on the web server. Websites that use JavaScript must send full blocks of code to clients' web browsers, which can eat up bandwidth, especially with large sites. PHP, on the other hand, executes code on the web server and then sends only the necessary HTML to the client to produce the completed page, thus eliminating the need to send lengthy code to web browsers.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="set of" class="calibre8" id="set of"/>PHP began as a small set of Perl scripts written by Rasmus Lerdorf. He used them to monitor traffic to his online resume. In 1995, after adding features, Lerdorf publicly released a tool written in C called PHP/FI (Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter). In 1997 two Israeli developers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote PHP/FI to accommodate their eCommerce project. This rewrite was released in mid-1998 as PHP 3. That winter, Suraski and Gutmans began another rewrite, this time of PHP's core. The product of this work became the Zend Engine, on which current versions of PHP are based.</p>
