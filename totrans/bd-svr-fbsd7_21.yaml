- en: SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) is a system for adding authentication
    support to connection-based protocols. For the purposes of this book, we will
    be using this mechanism for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The Postfix
    MTA employs SMTP to transfer Internet email. Adding authentication support to
    Postfix is important for users who wish to relay email through their server from
    an unsecured public network. A secure mail relay can be attained by coupling SASL
    with SSL/TLS-based encryption.

- en: By default, the Postfix MTA is not an open email relay. While this prevents
    unauthorized users from using the server to relay spam, it also prevents legitimate
    users from sending email from a location other than the local private network.
    Cyrus SASL allows the SMTP server to verify the identity of remote users. Once
    authenticated, users are allowed remote relay privileges.
