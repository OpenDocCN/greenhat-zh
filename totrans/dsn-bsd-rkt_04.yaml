- en: In the previous chapter we covered subverting the FreeBSD kernel using simple
    data-state changes. The discussion centered around modifying the data contained
    within the kernel queue data structures. In addition to record keeping, many of
    these structures are also directly involved in control flow, as they maintain
    a limited number of entry points into the kernel. Consequently, these can be hooked,
    too, just like the entry points discussed in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. HOOKING").
    This technique is referred to as *Kernel Object Hooking (KOH)*. To demonstrate
    it, let's hook a character device.

    a character device is defined by its entries in a character device switch table.^([[1](#ftn.CHP-4-FN-1)])
    As such, by modifying these entries, you can modify the behavior of a character
    device. Before demonstrating this "attack," however, some background information
    on character device management is necessary.

    you simply have to go through `cdevp_list`. Listing 4-1 offers an example. This
    code traverses `cdevp_list`, looking for `cd_example`;^([[2](#ftn.CHP-4-FN-2)])
    if it finds it, `cd_example`'s read entry point is replaced with a simple call
    hook.
