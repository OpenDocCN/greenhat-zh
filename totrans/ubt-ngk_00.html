This is not primarily a book for those seasoned geeks or power users; it's an introductory guide that will provide you with some hands-on experience that will get you up, running, and comfortable with the Ubuntu Linux distribution without pain. Think of this book as a map, a compass, and a comfy pair of hiking boots, rather than a harness, a rope, and a set of crampons.</p><div class="sect1" title="Version Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="version_compatibility"/>Version Compatibility</h1></div></div></div><p>This fourth edition of <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu for Non-Geeks</em></span> is based on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) Desktop edition. The CD bundled with this book is the Ubuntu Desktop CD, which lets you both try Ubuntu without installing it and install Ubuntu to your hard drive once you're ready. It's called a <span class="emphasis"><em>live CD</em></span>. You can boot your computer from the CD and run Ubuntu directly off the CD without touching your hard disk so that you can see if you like Ubuntu and make sure that Ubuntu will work with your hardware. If, after running the live CD, you like what you see and everything seems to work, you can install Ubuntu on your computer using the same disc. (There are instructions for doing so in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING">Chapter 2</a>.)</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The world of computers is dynamic, and there may be changes in the software or the links to the files for projects in this book after publication. Please see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.edgy-penguins.org/UFNG/">http://www.edgy-penguins.org/UFNG/</a> for updates.</p></div></div></div>

The text is organized by increasing skills, so that as much as possible you won't be asked to do something that you haven't already learned. In addition, you can put the various morsels of knowledge you acquire into practice through several exercises, or <span class="emphasis"><em>projects</em></span>.</p><p>The projects in this book serve a secondary purpose as well: By working through them, you will learn to configure and customize your Ubuntu system. By the time you finish this book, you should have pretty good mastery over Ubuntu.</p><p>These chapter descriptions should give you a better idea of what is in store:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. BECOMING A PENGUINISTA">Chapter 1</a></span></dt><dd><p>What's Linux?

Ideally, you should go through the book chapter by chapter, doing the projects along the way. This will give you a much broader understanding of how things are done (and of how you can get things done), and it will reduce the chance for anxiety, confusion, and, worse yet, mistakes.</p><p>It is best to read this book and complete its projects when you are relaxed and have time to spare. Nothing makes things go wrong more than working in a rush. And keep in mind that Linux and the projects in this book are fun, not just work exercises. Linux is fun so enjoy it!</p></div>
