- en: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between a server
    and a client system. According to RFC 959,^([[]](#CHP-26-1)) the four objectives
    of FTP are to promote the sharing of files, encourage use of remote computers,
    shield users from variations in file storage systems, and transfer data reliably
    and efficiently.

- en: Pure-FTPd is an open source FTP server that conforms to the original FTP standards
    with some additional functionality. These include a virtual user system, SSL/TLS
    encryption support, bandwidth throttling, and upload/download ratios, to name
    a few. Pure-FTPd supports both virtual users and users that exist on system-level
    accounts. This guide will exclusively focus on the virtual user scheme as it offers
    a larger feature set.

- en: Pure-FTPd is based on Troll-FTPd, originally written by Arnt Gulbrandsen in
    1995\. Active development of Troll-FTPd stagnated in the late '90s, prompting
    Frank Denis to create the Pure-FTPd project. Denis made some modifications to
    the Troll-FTPd code, wrote new documentation, and released Pure-FTPd in 2001\.
    A team of nine, led by Denis, continues development of the Pure-FTPd project.
