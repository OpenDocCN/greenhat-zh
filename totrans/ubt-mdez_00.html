This is not primarily a book for seasoned geeks or power users; it’s an introductory guide that will provide you with some hands-on experience to get up, running, and comfortable with the Ubuntu Linux distribution without pain. Think of this book as a map, a compass, and a comfy pair of hiking boots rather than a harness, a rope, and a set of crampons.</p><div class="sect1" title="Version Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="version_compatibility"/>Version Compatibility</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Made Easy</em></span> is based on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) Desktop edition. The CD bundled with this book is the Ubuntu Desktop CD, which lets you both try Ubuntu without installing it and install Ubuntu to your hard drive once you’re ready. It’s called a live CD. You can boot your computer from the CD and run Ubuntu directly off the CD without touching your hard disk to see if you like Ubuntu and to make sure that Ubuntu will work with your hardware. If, after running the live CD, you like what you see and everything seems to work, you can install Ubuntu on your computer using the same disc. (There are instructions for doing so in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a>.)</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Concept and Approach"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="concept_and_approach"/>Concept and Approach</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended as both a handy reference and a dynamic learning experience: You’ll get some hands-on experience as you work through it. The text is organized by increasing skills, so that, as much as possible, you won’t be asked to do something that you haven’t already learned. In addition, you can put the various morsels of knowledge you acquire into practice through several exercises, or <span class="emphasis"><em>projects</em></span>.</p><p>The projects in this book serve another purpose as well: By working through them, you will learn to configure and customize your Ubuntu system. By the time you finish this book, you should have a pretty good mastery of Ubuntu.</p><p>These chapter descriptions should give you a better idea of what is in store:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Becoming a Penguinista">Chapter 1</a></span></dt><dd><p>What’s Linux?
