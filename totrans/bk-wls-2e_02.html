That's the way most people relate to the technology that surrounds them. You shouldn't have to worry about the technical specifications just to place a long-distance telephone call or heat your lunch in a microwave oven or connect your laptop computer to a network. In an ideal world (ha!), the wireless link would work as soon as you turn on the power switch.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0038"/></p><p>But wireless networking today is about where broadcast radio was in the late 1920s.

This chapter describes the standards and specifications that control wireless networks and explains how data moves through the network from one computer to another.</p><div class="figure"><a id="every_new_technology_goes_through_the_tw"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e639"/><img alt="Every new technology goes through the tweak-and-fiddle stage." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254308.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-1. Every new technology goes through the tweak-and-fiddle stage.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>When the network is working properly, you should be able to use it without thinking about all of that internal plumbing—just click a few icons and you're connected. But when you're designing and building a new network, or when you want to improve the performance of an existing network, it can be essential to understand how all that data is supposed to move from one place to another. And when the network does something you aren't expecting it to do, you will need a basic knowledge of the technology to do any kind of useful troubleshooting.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_wireless_networks_work"/>How Wireless Networks Work</h1></div></div></div><p>Moving data through a wireless network involves three separate elements: the radio signals, the data format, and the network structure. Each of these elements is independent of the other two, so you must define all three when you invent a new network. In terms of the OSI reference model, the radio signal operates at the physical layer, and the data <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0039"/>format controls several of the higher layers. The network structure includes the wireless network interface <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0040"/> adapters and base stations that send and receive the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0041"/>radio signals. In a wireless network, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0042"/>network interface adapters in each computer and base station convert digital data to radio signals, which they transmit to other devices on the same network, and they receive and convert incoming radio signals from other network elements back to digital data.</p><p>Each of the broadband <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0043"/> wireless data services use a different combination <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0044"/>of radio signals, data formats, and network structure. We'll describe each type of wireless data network in more detail later in this chapter, but first, it's valuable to understand some general principles.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="radio"/>Radio</h2></div></div></div><p>The basic physical laws that make radio possible are known as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0045"/>Maxwell's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0046"/>equations, identified by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Without going into the math, Maxwell's equations show that a changing <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0047"/>magnetic field will produce an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0048"/>electric field, and a changing electric field will produce a magnetic field. When <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0049"/>alternating current (AC) moves through a wire or other physical conductor, some of that energy escapes into the surrounding space as an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0050"/>alternating magnetic field. That magnetic field creates an alternating electric field in space, which in turn creates another magnetic field and so forth until the original current is interrupted.</p><p>This form of energy in transition between electricity and magnetic energy is called <span class="emphasis"><em>electromagnetic radiation</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>radio waves.

Both transmitters and receivers use specially shaped devices called <span class="emphasis"><em>antennas</em></span> to focus the radio signal in a particular direction, or <span class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span>, and to increase the amount of effective radiation (from a transmitter) or sensitivity (in a receiver).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0051"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0053"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0054"/></p><p>By adjusting the rate at which alternating current flows from each transmitter through the antenna and out into space (the <span class="emphasis"><em>frequency</em></span>), and by adjusting a receiver to operate only at that frequency, it's possible to send and receive many different signals, each at a different frequency, that don't interfere with one another. The overall range of frequencies is known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>radio spectrum</em></span>.

For example, an FM radio station might be licensed to operate at 92.1 MHz at a certain geographical location.

Most unlicensed services are either restricted to very short distances, to specific frequency bands, or both.</p><p>Both AM and FM are <span class="emphasis"><em>analog</em></span> methods because the signal that comes out of the receiver is a replica of the signal that went into the transmitter.

Spread spectrum is extremely efficient, so the radio transmitters can operate with very low power. Because the signals operate on a relatively wide band of frequencies, they are less sensitive to interference from other radio signals and electrical noise, which means they can often get through in environments where a conventional narrow-band signal would be impossible to receive and understand. And because a frequency-hopping <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0090"/>spread spectrum signal shifts among more than one channel, it can be extremely difficult <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0091"/>for an unauthorized listener to intercept and decode the contents of a signal.</p><p>Spread spectrum technology has an interesting history. It was invented by the actress Hedy <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0092"/>Lamarr and the American avant-garde composer George <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0093"/>Antheil as a "Secret Communication System" for directing radio-controlled torpedoes that would not be vulnerable to enemy jamming. Before she came to Hollywood, Lamarr had been married to an arms merchant in Austria, where she learned about the problems of torpedo guidance at dinner parties with her husband's customers. Years later, shortly before the United States entered World War II, she came up with the concept of changing radio frequencies to cut through interference. <span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span> reported in 1941 that her "red hot" invention (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#hedy_lamarr_and_george_antheil_received_" title="Figure 2-4. Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil received this patent in 1942 for the invention that became the foundation of spread spectrum radio communication.

His most famous composition was an extravaganza called <span class="emphasis"><em>Ballet Mechanique,</em></span>which was scored for sixteen player pianos, two airplane propellers, four xylophones, four bass drums, and a siren. His design used the same kind of mechanism that he had previously used to synchronize the player pianos to change radio frequencies in a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0094"/>spread spectrum transmission. The original slotted paper tape system had 88 different radio channels—one <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0095"/>for each of the 88 keys on a piano.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0096"/></p><p>In theory, the same method could be used for voice and data communication as well as guiding torpedoes, but in the days of vacuum tubes, paper tape, and mechanical synchronization, the whole process was too complicated to actually build and use.

As the name suggests, FHSS technology divides a radio signal into small segments and "hops" from one frequency to another many times per second as it transmits those segments. The transmitter and the receiver establish a synchronized hopping pattern that sets the sequence in which they will use different subchannels.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0098"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0099"/></p><p>FHSS systems overcome interference from other users by using a narrow carrier signal that changes frequency many times per second. Additional transmitter and receiver pairs can use different hopping patterns on the same set of subchannels at the same time. At any point in time, each transmission is probably using a different subchannel, so there's no interference between signals. When a conflict does occur, the system resends the same packet until the receiver gets a clean copy and sends a confirmation back to the transmitting station.</p><p>For some older 802.11 wireless data services, the unlicensed 2.4 MHz band is split into 75 subchannels, each of them 1 MHz wide.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, you don't need to understand these technical details about how a Wi-Fi transmitter splits your data into tiny pieces and reassembles them into data unless you're a radio circuit designer.</p><p>But when you know that there's a well-defined set of rules and methods that make the connection work (even if you don't know all the details), you are in control.

For our purposes, two-way radio is the most sensible approach to wireless broadband, but other methods (such as infrared light or visible signaling) are also possible. Connecting your computer to the Internet (or a local network) by radio offers several advantages over connecting the same computer through a wired connection. First, wireless provides convenient access for portable computers; it's not necessary to find a cable or network data outlet. And second, it allows a user to make a connection from more than one location and to maintain a connection as the user moves from place to place. For network managers, a wireless connection makes it possible to distribute access to a network without the need to string wires or cut holes through walls.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0119"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1275"/></p><p>In practice, access without cables means that the owner of a laptop or other portable computer can walk into a classroom, a coffee shop, or a library and connect to the Internet by simply turning on the computer and running a communication program. Depending on the type of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0120"/>wireless network you're using, you might also be able to maintain the same connection in a moving vehicle.</p><p>When you're installing your own network, it's often easier to use <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0121"/>Wi-Fi links to extend your network and your Internet connection to other rooms because a wired system requires a physical path for the cables between the network router or switch and each computer. Unless you can route those cables through a false ceiling or some other existing channel, this almost always means that you must cut holes in your walls for data connectors and feed wires inside the walls and under the floors. A radio signal that passes through those same walls is often a lot neater and easier.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="wireless_data_services"/>Wireless Data Services</h1></div></div></div><p>Because radio signals move through the air, you can set up a network connection from any place within range of the network base station's transmitter; it's not necessary to use a telephone line, television cable, or some other dedicated wiring to connect your computer to the network. Just turn on the radio connected to the computer and it will find the network signal. Therefore, a radio (or wireless) network connection is often a lot more convenient than a wired one.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0122"/></p><p>This is not to say that wireless is always the best choice. A wired network is usually more secure than a wireless system because it's a lot more difficult for unauthorized eavesdroppers and other snoops to monitor data as it moves through the network, and a wired link doesn't require as many complex negotiations between the sender and receiver on protocols and so forth. In an environment where your computer never moves away from your desk and there are no physical obstacles between the computer and the network access point, it's often easier to install a data cable between the computer and a modem.</p><p>So now we have a bunch of radio transmitters and receivers that all operate on the same frequencies and all use the same kind of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0123"/>modulation. (<span class="emphasis"><em>Modulation</em></span> is the method a radio uses to add some kind of content, such as voice or digital data, to a radio wave.) The next step is to send some network data through those radios. Several different wireless data systems and services are available to connect computers and other devices to local networks and to the Internet, including Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and a handful of services based on the latest generations of cellular mobile telephone technology.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="wi-fi"/>Wi-Fi</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0124"/>IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has produced a set of standards and specifications for wireless networks under the title <span class="emphasis"><em>IEEE 802.11</em></span> that define the formats and structures of the relatively short-range signals that provide Wi-Fi service. The original 802.11 standard (without any letter at the end) was released in 1997. It covers several types of wireless media: two kinds of radio transmissions and networks that use infrared light. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0125"/>802.11b standard provides additional specifications for wireless Ethernet networks. A related document, IEEE <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0126"/>802.11a, describes wireless networks that operate at higher speeds on different radio frequencies. Still other 802.11 radio networking standards with other letters are also available or moving toward public release.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0127"/></p><p>The specifications in widest use today are 802.11a, 802.11b, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0128"/>802.11g. They're the de facto standards used by just about every wireless Ethernet LAN that you are likely to encounter in offices and public spaces and in most home networks. It's worth the trouble to keep an eye on the progress of those other standards, but for the moment, 802.11a and 802.11g are the ones to use for short-range wireless networks, especially if you're expecting to connect to networks where you don't control all the hardware yourself.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-1"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Many first-generation 802.11b Wi-Fi network adapters are still compatible with today's networks, but their manufacturers don't offer the device drivers that are necessary to make them work with the latest operating systems (such as Windows XP or Windows Vista)</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0129"/></p></div><p>The 802.11n standard is the next one in the pipeline, and when it's released, it will replace both 802.11b and 802.11g because it's faster, more secure, and more reliable.

The broadband wireless services provided by Sprint, AT&amp;T, and Verizon all share the frequencies around 800 MHz and 1,900 MHz used by those companies' digital mobile telephone networks. WiMAX services, such as Clearwire, use signals in the 2.3 to 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands.</p><p>Many new radio frequencies may open up for mobile telephone and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0164"/>data services in the United States after February 17, 2009, when all the existing analog television stations move to new digital channels, and the old <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0165"/>VHF channels will close down. The newly vacant radio spectrum will become available for new services, including broadband wireless data.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-5"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't panic. All your favorite television stations will still be available after the changeover. You will need either an inexpensive converter box or a new digital television set to receive them, but they'll still be there for you</em></span>.</p></div><p>The exact frequencies that the WiMAX and broadband wireless data services use are less important to you as a user than the frequencies of Wi-Fi signals because service providers control the base stations and access points. The network interface device in your computer automatically finds the right signal and sets up the connection without forcing you to choose a specific channel.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="choosing_a_service"/>Choosing a Service</h1></div></div></div><p>Each type of wireless access to the Internet offers a different combination of cost, coverage areas, reliability, ease of use, and security. Your choice will depend on your particular needs and the availability of signals in the locations where you need <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0166"/>wireless Internet access.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1856"/></p><p>For example, if you use your computer in just a few places and all of those places are within range of Wi-Fi hot spots, the built-in Wi-Fi adapter (or an inexpensive plug-in adapter) is probably your best choice. It's likely that Wi-Fi hot spots already exist at your workplace and in the libraries, coffee shops, schools, and conference centers where you regularly spend time, and it's relatively easy and inexpensive to install one or more access points at home. However, you will probably need a separate account to log in to each Wi-Fi network. Some of these Wi-Fi services are free, but others charge for access by the hour, by the day, or by the month; if you need paid accounts at several locations, the total cost can be more than a single account with a cellular service.</p><p>Wi-Fi also allows you to add portable computers to an existing LAN at home or in your school or workplace. And if cost is a primary concern, you will probably choose to use free public Wi-Fi hot spots instead of a cellular or WiMAX service that charges a monthly fee.</p><p>On the other hand, if you want constant Internet access wherever you go, the cellular data and WiMAX metropolitan area network services are better choices. Both systems provide coverage throughout large geographic regions, and both allow you to maintain a connection while you're moving from one place to another. You can use the same account and the same login and password every time you set up a connection. However, it's important to make sure that there's a usable cellular or WiMAX signal in all the places where you expect to use them <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you commit to a long-term contract. Most wireless data service providers offer a free or low cost trial period that you can use to test the system.</p><p>As WiMAX and cellular data services become more common, many laptop computers and add-on network adapters will operate with both types of wireless services. When the computer detects a high-speed Wi-Fi signal, it will automatically try to establish a connection to that network. But when there is no local Wi-Fi signal, or if you haven't configured your computer to use any of the local signals, it will automatically shift over to your WiMAX or cellular data account and use that service to connect to the Internet.</p><p>All three types of wireless Internet services—Wi-Fi, cellular, and WiMAX—offer fast and reliable connections, but each has a different set of strengths and weaknesses. For short-range coverage and for access to local area networks, Wi-Fi is the obvious choice. If you are outside of the service areas of a DSL or cable Internet service, WiMAX is a huge improvement over a slow dial-up service. But when you carry your computer to many locations, a single account with a cellular or WiMAX service will allow you to connect to the Internet without the need to search for a new hot spot and set up a new account.</p></div></body></html>
