- en: A system administrator for a major university was responsible for keeping several
    hundred DEC machines running. He quickly learned how to diagnose broken machines
    and figure out which board was bad. To get a steady supply of spare parts he had
    to purchase a service contract. This meant that a DEC service representative was
    supposed to come down, diagnose the machines, and figure out which board was bad
    and replace it. In practice, the university staff had strict orders to never let
    the DEC service representative near the machines.

- en: A typical service would start with the administrator telling DEC which board
    was bad. The service representative would come down, find the broken board on
    the administrator's desk, and replace it with a good one. No running diagnostics
    or other work, that was all done for him.

- en: A few years later, DEC instituted a "Smart Spares" program. The idea was that
    you had someone trained, on site, who could figure out which board was bad and
    order a replacement from DEC. Of course this suited the university, because it
    had been operating that way for years.

- en: The catch was that you had to take a class, at DEC, to learn how to diagnose
    systems. The system administrator jumped at this opportunity. He needed the vacation.
    He practically slept through the two days of classes. The third day was devoted
    to a lab. The instructor had set up three machines. The students were divided
    into groups and were supposed to spend the morning finding out what was wrong
    with their machine.

    and then said, "Bad disk card." The instructor was a little surprised." "How do
    you know that?"

    and this one guy had diagnosed all the machines in two minutes flat. (I talked
    to him a while back, and he told me that if he knew he was being timed, he would
    have worked faster.)

    problem. This one has been set up by field service and was supposed to have a
    really tough problem, next to impossible to find.

    and waited to see what our hero would do. The guy opened the back, and even before
    he hit the "On" switch pointed to a board and said "That board is bad; chip U18\.
    It'll cause an intermittent data bus parity error."

    I put it there so I'd be sure that DEC didn't trade me back my own boards. This
    board is from the university. I'm the one who originally found the problem and
    showed it to DEC field service."
