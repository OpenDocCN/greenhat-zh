- en: As you learned in "[FreeBSD 7.0](freebsd_7.0_split_000.html#freebsd_7.0)" the
    ports collection provides a simple and centralized way of installing software
    on FreeBSD. It consists of categorized directories containing makefiles that are
    used by the `make` command to compile source code into executable programs or
    libraries. The ports collection is designed to be automated and relatively easy
    to use.

- en: Ports are maintained by designated port administrators who are responsible for
    ensuring that each port stays current with the latest version available from the
    original software author.

- en: 'Installing software from a port builds the program from its source code; if
    the source code isn''t already on the system, it is downloaded from a site designated
    in the makefile. The system verifies the contents of the downloaded source code,
    typically using an MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) hash to ensure its authenticity.
    An MD5 hash is a 32-character alphanumeric string that is like a fingerprint for
    the file. A typical MD5 hash might look like this: e6c75c12f663a484ee3157ab058cfc9e.'

- en: Once the authenticity of the source code has been assured, the make program
    checks the makefile to see if the port requires any other software. If it does,
    FreeBSD installs those dependencies as well. Next, patches are applied to the
    source code, as necessary, before it is compiled and installed.

- en: Once all processes are complete, the port is treated as a FreeBSD package and
    recorded in the installed packages database, pkgdb.db, which is stored in the
    /var/db/pkg directory. Information on the FreeBSD package system can be found
    at [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-overview.html](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-overview.html).
