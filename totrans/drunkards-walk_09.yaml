- en: '**I**N 1848 TWO TEENAGE GIRLS, Margaret and Kate Fox, heard unexplained noises,
    like knocking or the moving of furniture. Their house, it happened, had a reputation
    for being haunted. As the story goes,[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts1a)
    Kate challenged the source of the noises to repeat the snap of her fingers and
    to rap out her age. It rose to both challenges. Over the next few days, with their
    mother’s and some neighbors’ assistance, the sisters worked out a code with which
    they could communicate with the rapper (no pun intended). They concluded that
    the rapping originated with the spirit of a peddler who had been murdered years
    earlier in the home they now occupied. With that, modern spiritualism—the belief
    that the dead can communicate with the living—was born. By the early 1850s a particular
    type of spiritual contact, called table rapping, and its cousins, table moving
    and table turning, had become the rage in the United States and Europe. The enterprise
    consisted of a group of individuals arranging themselves around a table, resting
    their hands upon it, and waiting. In table rapping, after some time passed, a
    rap would be heard. In table moving and table turning, after time passed, the
    table would begin to tilt or move about, sometimes dragging the sitters along
    with it. One pictures serious bearded men with jackets reaching their midthigh
    and ardent women in hoop skirts, eyes wide in wonder as their hands followed the
    table this way or that.'

    凯特挑战噪音的来源重复她的手指弹响声，并敲击出她的年龄。它接受了这两个挑战。在接下来的几天里，在她们的母亲和一些邻居的帮助下，姐妹俩制定了一个代码，通过这个代码她们可以与敲击者（无意中开玩笑）进行交流。她们得出结论，敲击声来自一个多年前在他们现在居住的房屋中被谋杀的商贩的灵魂。就这样，现代灵性主义——相信死者可以与生者交流——诞生了。到19世纪50年代初，一种特定的灵性接触方式，称为桌摇，及其表亲桌移动和桌转，在美国和欧洲变得流行起来。这项活动包括一群人围坐在桌子周围，把手放在桌子上，等待。在桌摇中，经过一段时间后，会听到敲击声。在桌移动和桌转中，经过一段时间后，桌子会开始倾斜或移动，有时甚至把坐着的人也拖动起来。人们可以想象到严肃的留胡须的男子，穿着到膝盖的夹克，以及穿着裙子的热情女性，眼睛充满惊奇，他们的手随着桌子这样或那样地移动。'
- en: Table moving became so popular that in the summer of 1853 scientists began to
    look into it. One group of physicians noted that during the silent sitting period
    a kind of unconscious consensus seemed to form about the direction in which the
    table would move.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts2a) They found
    that when they diverted the sitters’ attention so that a common expectation could
    not form, the table did not move. In another trial they managed to create a condition
    in which half the sitters expected the table to move to the left and half expected
    it to move to the right, and again it did not move. They concluded that “the motion
    was due to muscular action, mostly exercised unconsciously.” But the definitive
    investigation was performed by the physicist Michael Faraday, one of the founders
    of electromagnetic theory, inventor of the electric motor, and one of the greatest
    experimental scientists in history.[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts3a)
    Faraday first discovered that the phenomenon would occur even with just one subject
    sitting at the table. Then, enrolling subjects who were both “very honorable”
    and accomplished table movers, he conducted a series of ingenious and intricate
    experiments proving that the movement of the sitters’ hands preceded that of the
    table. Further, he designed an indicator that alerted the subjects in real time
    whenever that was occurring. He found that “as soon as the…[indicator] is placed
    before the most earnest [subject]…the power [of the illusion] is gone; and this
    only because the parties are made conscious of what they are really doing.”[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts4a)

  zh: 桌子移动变得如此流行，以至于在1853年夏天，科学家们开始研究它。一组医生注意到，在无声静坐期间，似乎形成了一种关于桌子将朝哪个方向移动的无意识共识。[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts2a)
    他们发现，当他们的注意力被分散，以至于不能形成共同期望时，桌子就不会移动。在另一个试验中，他们设法创造了一种条件，其中一半的坐者预期桌子会向左移动，另一半预期桌子会向右移动，但桌子仍然没有移动。他们得出结论，这种“运动是由于肌肉动作，主要是无意识进行的。”但最终的调查是由物理学家迈克尔·法拉第进行的，他是电磁理论的创始人之一，电动机的发明者，也是历史上最伟大的实验科学家之一。[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts3a)
    法拉第首先发现，即使只有一位坐者坐在桌子旁，这种现象也会发生。然后，他招募了那些“非常值得尊敬”且擅长桌子移动的坐者，进行了一系列巧妙而复杂的实验，证明坐者的手的移动先于桌子的移动。此外，他设计了一种指示器，在实时提醒坐者这种移动何时发生。他发现，“一旦将……[指示器]放在最认真的[坐者]面前……[错觉]的力量就消失了；这仅仅是因为参与者意识到了他们真正在做什么。”[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts4a)
- en: Faraday concluded, as the doctors had, that the sitters were unconsciously pulling
    and pushing the table. The movement probably began as random fidgeting. Then at
    some point the sitters perceived in the randomness a pattern. That pattern precipitated
    a self-fulfilling expectation as the subjects’ hands followed the imagined leadership
    of the table. The value of his indicator, Faraday wrote, was thus “the corrective
    power it possesses over the mind of the table-turner.”[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts5a)
    Human perception, Faraday recognized, is not a direct consequence of reality but

  zh: 法拉第得出结论，正如医生们所做的那样，坐者无意识地拉动和推动桌子。这种运动可能最初是从随意的烦躁不安开始的。然后在某个时刻，坐者从这种随机性中感知到了一种模式。这种模式导致了一种自我实现的预期，因为坐者的手跟随桌子的想象中的领导。法拉第写道，他的指示器的价值在于“它对桌子转盘者心智的纠正能力。”[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts5a)

- en: Perception requires imagination because the data people encounter in their lives
    are never complete and always equivocal. For example, most people consider that
    the greatest evidence of an event one can obtain is to see it with their own eyes,
    and in a court of law little is held in more esteem than eyewitness testimony.
    Yet if you asked to display for a court a video of the same quality as the unprocessed
    data captured on the retina of a human eye, the judge might wonder what you were
    trying to put over. For one thing, the view will have a blind spot where the optic
    nerve attaches to the retina. Moreover, the only part of our field of vision with
    good resolution is a narrow area of about 1 degree of visual angle around the
    retina’s center, an area the width of our thumb as it looks when held at arm’s
    length. Outside that region, resolution drops off sharply. To compensate, we constantly
    move our eyes to bring the sharper region to bear on different portions of the
    scene we wish to observe. And so the pattern of raw data sent to the brain is
    a shaky, badly pixilated picture with a hole in it. Fortunately the brain processes
    the data, combining the input from both eyes, filling in gaps on the assumption
    that the visual properties of neighboring locations are similar and interpolating.[⁷](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts7a)
    The result—at least until age, injury, disease, or an excess of mai tais takes

- en: Scientists have moved to protect themselves from identifying false patterns
    by developing methods of statistical analysis to decide whether a set of observations
    provides good support for a hypothesis or whether, on the contrary, the apparent
    support is probably due to chance. For example, when physicists seek to determine
    whether the data from a supercollider is significant, they don’t eyeball their
    graphs, looking for bumps that rise above the noise; they apply mathematical techniques.
    One such technique, significance testing, was developed in the 1920s by R. A.
    Fisher, one of the greatest statisticians of the twentieth century (a man also
    known for his uncontrollable temper and for a feud with his fellow statistics
    pioneer Karl Pearson that was so bitter he continued to attack his nemesis long

    Fisher）开发的（这位先生也因他无法控制的脾气以及与他的同僚统计学家先驱卡尔·皮尔逊（Karl Pearson）之间的激烈争执而闻名，这场争执如此激烈，以至于皮尔逊在1936年去世后，他仍然继续攻击他的对手）。

    we find that she is almost always right, we might hypothesize that she is somehow
    skilled at it, for instance, through psychic powers. On the other hand, if she
    is right about half the time, the data support the hypothesis that she was just
    guessing. But what if the data fall somewhere in between or if there isn’t much
    data? Where do we draw the line between accepting and rejecting the competing
    hypotheses? This is what significance testing does: it is a formal procedure for
    calculating the probability of our having observed what we observed *if* the hypothesis

    accurately predict the results of coin tosses. And suppose that in an experimental
    trial she predicts the coin tosses correctly in a certain number of cases. Then
    the methods we analyzed in chapter 4 allow us to calculate the probability that
    she could have accomplished the predictions by chance alone. If she had guessed
    the coin-toss results correctly so often that, say, the probability of her being
    that successful by chance alone is only 3 percent, then we would reject the hypothesis
    that she was guessing. In the jargon of significance testing, we would say the
    significance level of our rejection is 3 percent, meaning that the chances are
    at most 3 percent that by chance the data has led us astray. A 3 percent level
    of significance is fairly impressive, and so the media might report the feat as
    new evidence of the existence of psychic powers. Still, those of us who don’t

- en: 'This example illustrates an important point: even with data significant at,
    say, the 3 percent level, if you test 100 nonpsychic people for psychic abilities—or
    100 ineffective drugs for their effectiveness—you ought to expect a few people
    to show up as psychic or a few ineffective drugs to show up as effective. That’s
    one reason political polls or medical studies, especially small ones, sometimes
    contradict earlier polls or studies. Still, significance testing and other statistical
    methods serve scientists well, especially when they can conduct large-scale controlled
    studies. But in everyday life we don’t conduct such studies, nor do we intuitively
    apply statistical analysis. Instead, we rely on gut instinct. When my Viking stove
    turned out to be a lemon and by chance an acquaintance told me she’d had the same
    experience, I started telling my friends to avoid the brand. When the flight attendants
    on several United Airlines flights seemed grumpier than those on other airlines

  zh: 这个例子说明了一个重要的观点：即使数据在3%的显著性水平上是显著的，如果你测试100个非心灵感应者以测试他们的心灵感应能力——或者100个无效药物以测试其有效性——你应该预期会有少数人表现出心灵感应能力，或者少数无效药物表现出有效性。这就是为什么政治民意调查或医学研究，尤其是小规模的研究，有时会与早期的民意调查或研究相矛盾。然而，显著性检验和其他统计方法为科学家们提供了良好的服务，尤其是在他们可以进行大规模的对照研究时。但在日常生活中，我们并不进行这样的研究，我们也没有直觉地应用统计分析。相反，我们依赖直觉。当我的维京炉灶变成了一堆废铁，并且偶然间一个熟人告诉我她也有过同样的经历时，我开始告诉我的朋友们避免这个品牌。当我在最近乘坐的其他几家航空公司的航班上遇到的乘务员似乎比那些航空公司的乘务员更无精打采时，我开始避免乘坐联合航空的航班。那里的数据不多，但我的直觉识别出了模式。

    For example, in 2006 *The New England Journal of Medicine* published a $12.5 million

    is no more effective in relieving arthritis pain than a placebo. Still, one eminent
    doctor had a hard time letting go of his feeling that the supplements were effective
    and ended his analysis of the study on a national radio program by reaffirming
    the possible benefit of the treatment, remarking that, “One of my wife’s doctors
    has a cat and she says that this cat cannot get up in the morning without a little

    those shortcuts heuristics. In general, heuristics are useful, but just as our
    manner of processing optical information sometimes leads to optical illusions,

    such errors biases. We all use heuristics, and we all suffer from biases. But
    although optical illusions seldom have much relevance in our everyday world, cognitive
    biases play an important role in human decision making. And so in the late twentieth
    century a movement sprang up to study how randomness is perceived by the human

    of good or bad quarters, or dates, need not have any “cause” at all. The point
    was rather starkly illustrated by the mathematician George Spencer-Brown, who

    在数据中找到模式很容易——例如，开头连续四个O后面跟着四个X，以及结尾处连续六个X。根据随机性的数学原理，在200次随机抛掷中，这样的连续出现是可以预料的。然而，它们却让大多数人感到惊讶。因此，当用X和O的字符串来代表影响我们生活的事件时，人们会寻求对这种模式的合理解释。当一串X代表股市的下跌日时，人们相信那些解释市场波动的专家。当一串O代表你最喜欢的体育明星的一系列成就时，解说员在喋喋不休地谈论球员的“连续性”时听起来很有说服力。而当，正如我们之前看到的，X或O代表派拉蒙和哥伦比亚电影公司制作的连续失败电影时，当行业杂志宣称谁真正掌握了全球电影观众的脉搏时，每个人都点头表示同意。

    Leonard Koppett.[^(20)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts20a) In 1978,
    Koppett revealed a system that he claimed could determine, by the end of January
    every year, whether the stock market would go up or down in that calendar year.
    His system had correctly predicted the market, he said, for the past eleven years.[^(21)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts21a)
    Of course, stock-picking systems are easy to identify in hindsight; the true test
    is whether they will work in the future. Koppett’s system passed that test too:
    judging the market by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it worked for eleven straight
    years, from 1979 through 1989, got it wrong in 1990, and was correct again every
    year until 1998\. But although Koppett’s predictions were correct for a streak
    of eighteen out of nineteen years, I feel confident in asserting that his streak
    involved no skill whatsoever. Why? Because Leonard Koppett was a columnist for
    *Sporting News,* and his system was based on the results of the Super Bowl, the
    championship game of professional football. Whenever the team from the (original)
    National Football League won, the stock market, he predicted, would rise. Whenever
    the team from the (original) American Football League won, he predicted, the market
    would go down. Given that information, few people would argue that Koppett was
    anything but lucky. Yet had he had different credentials—and not revealed his

    models.” Not even the twenty-one-game losing streak experienced at the start of
    the 1988 season by Major League Baseball’s Baltimore Orioles. Bad players and
    teams have longer and more frequent streaks of failure than great players and
    great teams, and great players and great teams have longer and more frequent streaks
    of success than lesser players and lesser teams. But that is because their average
    failure or success rate is higher, and the higher the average rate, the longer

    a random process may seem less shocking in light of a few other statistics. For

    of the prices of the stocks it comprises; it is a weighted average in which stocks
    exert influence proportional to each company’s capitalization. Miller’s fund did
    worse than the simple average of S&P stocks but better than that weighted average.
    Actually, there were more than thirty twelve-month periods during his streak in
    which he lost to the weighted average, but they weren’t calendar years, and the

    听起来好像那一年标准普尔打败了米勒，但实际上他在“胜利”栏中计算了2004年。这是因为标准普尔500指数并不是其所包含的股票价格的简单平均；它是一个加权平均，其中股票的影响力与每家公司的市值成比例。米勒的基金的表现不如标准普尔股票的简单平均，但好于加权平均。实际上，在他连续性的期间，有三十多个十二个月的周期，他的表现不如加权平均，但这些并不是日历年份，连续性是基于1月1日至12月31日期间的间隔。[^(27)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts27a)

    odds because there are thousands of mutual fund managers (over 6,000 currently),
    and there were many fifteen-year periods in which the feat could have been accomplished.
    So the relevant question is, if thousands of people are tossing coins once a year

- en: To make this explanation concrete, suppose 1,000 fund managers—certainly an
    underestimate—had each tossed a coin once a year starting in 1991 (the year Miller
    began his streak). After the first year about half of them would have tossed heads;
    after two years about one-quarter of them would have tossed two heads; after the
    third year one-eighth of them would have tossed three heads; and so on. By then
    some who had tossed tails would have started to drop out of the game, but that
    wouldn’t affect the analysis because they had already failed. The chances that,
    after fifteen years, a *particular coin tosser* would have tossed all heads are
    then 1 in 32,768\. But the chances that *someone among the 1,000* who had started
    tossing coins in 1991 would have tossed all heads are much higher, about 3 percent.
    Finally, there is no reason to consider only those who started tossing coins in
    1991—the fund managers could have started in 1990 or 1970 or any other year in
    the era of modern mutual funds. Since the writers for *The Consilient Observer*
    used forty years in their discussion, I calculated the odds that by chance *some
    manager* in the last four decades would beat the market each year for *some fifteen-year
    period.* That latitude increased the odds again, to the probability I quoted earlier,

  zh: 为了使这个解释更具体，假设有1,000名基金经理——这显然是一个低估——从1991年开始每年掷一次硬币（米勒开始连续获胜的那一年）。第一年后，大约一半的人会掷出正面；两年后，大约四分之一的人会掷出两个正面；第三年后，八分之一的人会掷出三个正面；以此类推。那时，一些掷出反面的人可能会开始退出游戏，但这不会影响分析，因为他们已经失败了。在15年后，一个“特定的掷硬币者”连续掷出所有正面的概率是32,768分之一。但是，在1991年开始掷硬币的1,000人中有一个人连续掷出所有正面的概率要高得多，大约是3%。最后，我们没有理由只考虑那些从1991年开始掷硬币的人——基金经理们可以在1990年、1970年或现代共同基金时代的任何一年开始。由于《一致观察者》的作者们在讨论中使用了40年，我计算了在过去四十年中，通过偶然机会“某些经理”在某个15年期间每年击败市场的概率。这种灵活性再次增加了概率，达到了我之前引用的概率，几乎四分之三。所以，与其对米勒的连续获胜感到惊讶，我可以说，如果没有人达到像米勒那样的连续获胜，你完全可以有理由抱怨那些高薪经理的表现不如他们通过盲目机会的表现！

    clusters of cancer to develop from environmental causes and show themselves in
    concert and before the victims have moved away from the affected area is quite
    a long shot. According to Neutra, to produce the kind of cancer clusters epidemiologists

    the same people who drive a car after consuming half a bottle of scotch will freak
    out if the airplane they are on experiences minor turbulence. Our desire to control
    events is not without purpose, for a sense of personal control is integral to
    our self-concept and sense of self-esteem. In fact, one of the most beneficial
    things we can do for ourselves is to look for ways to exercise control over our
    lives—or at least to look for ways that help us feel that we do. The psychologist
    Bruno Bettelheim observed, for instance, that survival in Nazi concentration camps
    “depended on one’s ability to arrange to preserve some areas of independent action,
    to keep control of some important aspects of one’s life despite an environment
    that seemed overwhelming.”[^(33)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts33a)

- en: One manifestation of that illusion occurs when an organization experiences a
    period of improvement or failure and then readily attributes it not to the myriad
    of circumstances constituting the state of the organization as a whole and to
    luck but to the person at the top. That’s especially obvious in sports, where,
    as I mentioned in the Prologue, if the players have a bad year or two, it is the
    coach who gets fired. In major corporations, in which operations are large and
    complex and to a great extent affected by unpredictable market forces, the causal
    connection between brilliance at the top and company performance is even less
    direct and the efficacy of reactionary firings is no greater than it is in sports.
    Researchers at Columbia University and Harvard, for example, recently studied
    a large number of corporations whose bylaws made them vulnerable to shareholders’
    demands that they respond to rough periods by changing management.[^(44)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts44a)
    They found that in the three years after the firing there was no improvement,
    on average, in operating performance (a measure of earnings). No matter what the
    differences in ability among the CEOs, they were swamped by the effect of the
    uncontrollable elements of the system, just as the differences among musicians
    might become unapparent in a radio broadcast with sufficient noise and static.
    Yet in determining compensation, corporate boards of directors often behave as
    if the CEO is the *only* one who matters.

- en: When we are in the grasp of an illusion—or, for that matter, whenever we have
    a new idea—instead of searching for ways to prove our ideas wrong, we usually
    attempt to prove them correct. Psychologists call this the confirmation bias,
    and it presents a major impediment to our ability to break free from the misinterpretation
    of randomness. In the example above, most people immediately recognize that the
    sequence consists of increasing even numbers. Then, seeking to confirm their guess,
    they try out many more sequences of that type. But very few find the answer the

    them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken.”[^(46)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c09-nts46a)

    might be interpreted in that light stand out in our minds, and those that don’t

    researchers then provided all the students with the same set of academic studies
    on the efficacy of capital punishment. Half the studies supported the idea that
    the death penalty has a deterrent effect; the other half contradicted that idea.
    The researchers also gave the subjects clues hinting at the weak points in each
    of the studies. Afterward the undergraduates were asked to rate the quality of
    the studies individually and whether and how strongly their attitudes about the
    death penalty were affected by their reading. The participants gave higher ratings
    to the studies that confirmed their initial point of view even when the studies
    on both sides had supposedly been carried out by the same method. And in the end,
    though everyone had read all the same studies, both those who initially supported
    the death penalty and those who initially opposed it reported that reading the
    studies had strengthened their beliefs. Rather than convincing anyone, the data
    polarized the group. Thus even random patterns can be interpreted as compelling
    evidence if they relate to our preconceived notions.
