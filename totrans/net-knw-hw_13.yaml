    outsiders and damage caused by intentional or accidental misuse or abuse by internal
    network users. Computer networks are vulnerable to several forms of attack, including
    unauthorized access to files, theft of service, and denial of service caused by
    excessive network-connection requests. Strictly speaking, attacks on individual
    computers, such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, are a separate issue from
    network vulnerabilities, but a good network security plan will include firewalls
    and other tools that also protect the computers connected to the network.

    that identifies the LAN to the Internet and the internal IP addresses that identify
    individual computers within the local network. The firewall normally blocks all
    incoming requests for data to network hosts, but this creates problems when you
    want to use one or more of the computers on the local network as file servers.
    So the firewall redirects certain types of requests to the appropriate computer
    inside the firewall.
  prefs: []

    the type of server. For example, web servers operate on port 80, and FTP servers
    use port 21, so those port numbers are part of the request for access. To accept
    access requests to a server, you must instruct the firewall's *Network Address
    Translation (NAT)* function to forward those requests to a specific computer within
    the LAN. [Table 13-2](ch13.html#common_tcp_solidus_ip_service_port_numb "Table 13-2. Common

    to the next. A web server on 192.168.0.23 today won't migrate to 192.168.0.47
    next week. That's generally not a problem on a wired network, but in a wireless
    setting where network clients join and leave the network all the time, the DHCP
    server automatically assigns the next available address to each new client. If
    one of those clients is the home of one of the network's service ports, the NAT
    probably won't find it. This problem is not common, because most networks don't
    use portable computers as servers, but it can happen. The solution is to turn
    off the DHCP server and assign a permanent IP address to each client.

    through a wireless link and longer-range VPNs that start on a wireless network
    and relay the data to a remote server. These are two different uses for a VPN:
    a *local* VPN that only extends across the wireless portion of a network between
    the client devices and the access point, and an *extended network* that carries
    VPN-encoded data beyond the access points to a VPN server through a public network,
    such as the Internet or a dial-up telephone connection. An extended network is
    a traditional VPN that happens to originate from a wireless network client. The
    same VPN can also support connections that don''t include a wireless segment and
    logins from public wireless services, such as the ones at airports or coffee shops.
    This setup is conventional for a VPN.'

- en: Local, short-range VPNs are interesting to people who operate wireless networks
    because they add another layer of security to wireless links. Because the data
    moving between wireless clients and the network access point is encrypted (using
    an algorithm that is more secure than WPA encryption), it is unintelligible to
    any third party who might be monitoring the radio signal. Because the VPN server
    won't accept data links at the access point from wireless clients that are not
    using the correct VPN drivers and passwords, an intruder can't break into the
    network by associating a rogue client with the access point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of a wireless VPN is to protect the wireless link between the clients
    and the access point and to lock out unauthorized users. Therefore, the isolated
    and encrypted data can only move across a single room rather than over hundreds
    or thousands of miles. Of course, the access point might also relay VPN-encoded
    data onward through the Internet to a network host in another location.

- en: A VPN moves data through one or more intermediate networks to a destination
    on another network. The VPN's tunneling client encapsulates the existing data
    packets or frames by adding a new header with the routing information that instructs
    the packets how to reach the VPN's endpoint. The transmission path through the
    intermediate networks is called a *tunnel*. At the other end of the tunnel, the
    VPN server removes the tunneling header and forwards the data to the destination
    specified by the next layer of headers. The exact form of the tunnel doesn't make
    any difference to the data because the data treats the tunnel as a point-to-point
    connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tunneling headers can take several forms. The methods used most widely in
    VPNs are Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
    (L2TP), and IP Security (IPsec) mode. PPTP and L2TP can move data through IP,
    IPX, and NetBEUI networks; IPsec is limited to IP networks. Both the client and
    the server must use the same protocol.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In PPTP and L2TP, the client and server must configure the tunnel for each transmission
    before they begin to exchange data. The configuration parameters include the route
    through the intermediate network and the encryption and compression specifications.
    When the transmission is complete, the client and server terminate the connection
    and close the tunnel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, several data security analysts have identified significant flaws
    in PPTP that allow intruders to break into a PPTP-based VPN and sniff passwords
    and then decode encryption, read data, or inflict damage to a network server.
    Therefore, PPTP headers are not secure and should not be used.
  prefs: []

    Virtual Private Network Consortium (VPNC) is moving toward a set of interoperability
    tests and certification standards (much like the Wi-Fi standards for wireless
    Ethernet equipment). The VPNC website ([http://www.vpnc.org/](http://www.vpnc.org/))

    how it works, even if you choose not to use it. As the name suggests, the original
    intent of the wired equivalent privacy (WEP) protocol was to provide a level of
    security on wireless networks that was comparable to the security of a wired network.
    That was the goal, but a network that depends on WEP encryption is almost as vulnerable
    to intrusion as a network with no protection at all. WEP will keep out the casual
    snoops (and your freeloading neighbors, if they're not particularly adept at cracking
    encryption), but WEP is not particularly effective against a dedicated intruder.
    The more recent WPA encryption is always the better choice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'WEP encryption is intended to serve three functions: It prevents unauthorized
    access to the network; it performs an integrity check on each packet; and it protects
    the data from eavesdroppers. WEP uses a secret encryption key to encode data packets
    before a network client or an access point transmits them, and it uses the same
    key to decode packets after it receives them. The original standard used shared
    authentication, in which the access point sends a challenge packet that a client
    must encrypt with the proper WEP key and send back. However, this opens a significant
    vulnerability by allowing a snooper to watch both parts of the exchange and derive
    the key.'
  prefs: []

- en: The "open" authentication method, which should be used by any network using
    WEP (not that any network should use WEP), simply discards packets that cannot
    be decrypted by the network's WEP key. Therefore, the WEP settings must be exactly
    the same on every access point and client adapter in the network. This sounds
    simple enough, but it can get confusing because manufacturers use different methods
    to identify the size and format of a WEP key. The functions don't change from
    one brand to another, but identical settings don't always have identical descriptions.

    difficult to crack (but they are still pretty insecure), they also increase the
    amount of time needed to transmit each packet. However, confusion arises because
    a 40-bit WEP key is the same as a 64-bit WEP key, and a 104-bit key is the same
    as a 128-bit key. The standard 64-bit WEP key is a string that includes an internally
    generated 24-bit initialization vector and a 40-bit secret key assigned by the
    network manager. Some manufacturers' specifications and configuration programs
    call this *64-bit encryption*, but others describe it as *40-bit encryption*.
    Either way, the encryption scheme is the same, so an adapter that uses 40-bit
    encryption is fully compatible with an access point or another adapter that uses
    64-bit encryption.

    on a mixed network of 128-bit and 64-bit devices will operate at 64 bits. If your
    access point and all of your adapters accept 128-bit encryption, use a 128-bit

    that only recognize 64-bit encryption, set the entire network to use 64-bit keys.

    characters, and a 104-bit (or 128-bit) key has 13 characters. In hex, each character
    uses 4 bits, so a 40-bit key has 10 hex characters, and a 128-bit key has 26 characters.

    the Wireless Setting screen for a D-Link access point, the 40-bit Shared Key Security

    runs all 10 characters together in a single string, but some others split them
    into 5 sets of 2 digits or 2 sets of 5\. The key looks the same to the computer
    either way, but copying the string when it's broken apart is easier.

    the key frequently, it's a lot more difficult for a cracker to gather enough information

    the same passphrase on their computer or other network device (or set their device
    to automatically enter the passphrase). When you set up WPA encryption, you must
    specify whether the network uses a server or PSK mode.

    correctly is not something that you want to do frequently, so the ASCII alternative
    is the better choice for most users. For optimal security, the ASCII passphrase
    you assign to your network should be a random mixture of at least 20 characters
    including letters (capitals and lowercase), numbers, and punctuation marks.

    that some of its proponents might want you to believe. In particular, programs
    called coWPAtty and Aircrack-ng both use *dictionary attacks* on WPA-TKIP networks
    to try thousands or millions of possible keys until they find the correct one.
    Fortunately, neither of these programs nor any of the others aimed at cracking
    WPA encryption are easy to use, and cracking a network can take a lot of time,
    so successful attacks on WPA are not particularly common. This technique takes
    time because the programs can only try about 50 different encryption keys per
    second, but eventually they will find the right passphrase and connect to the
    target network. Because each additional letter, number, or other character in
    a key increases the key's complexity, a long key takes much longer to crack than
    a short one. However, a commercial product called Elcomsoft Distributed Password
    Recovery uses graphics processors on video cards to "break Wi-Fi encryption up
    to 100 times faster than by using CPU only," so even a relatively long key is
    not that secure.

    keep intruders from connecting to a wireless LAN, but it forces the network administrator

    new user wants to join the network, and every time an established user swaps adapters
    or gets a new laptop, PDA, or other device with a built-in adapter, the network
    manager must add one more MAC address to the list. This task is probably manageable
    in a home or small office network, but it could be a major undertaking for a larger
    corporate or campus-wide system, if it's practical at all.
