  <h1><span class="chapter">Chapter 13</span><br/>
  Onward!</h1>

  <p>The state of the art in Xbox hacking is constantly advancing. Thousands of hackers are constantly researching, innovating, discovering, and sharing <span style="font-size: 1em;">new methods and techniques for making the Xbox a more useful and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">valuable piece of hardware to its end users. Keeping abreast of the latest developments in hacking can be overwhelming. Hopefully, reading this</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">book has given you the faculties to understand the latest posts and news</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">on various websites and web fora dedicated to Xbox hacking. This</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chapter discusses where you can go to find out more about the latest</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacks, where to ask for help, and how you can contribute your unique</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">abilities and perspective to the community. This chapter also discusses</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">some of the larger challenges that will face hackers in the future, namely</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the trusted PC initiatives.</span></p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_109"><b class="calibre3">The Hacking Community</b></h2>

  <p>Xbox hackers are an anarchistic community that works mostly underground, <span style="font-size: 1em;">keeping in touch and sharing information through various Internet “fora”</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(fora is the plural of forum, as data is the plural of datum). Most of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox hacking community keeps a low profile, and hackers often use</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pseudonyms to protect their identities. The reasons for using pseudonyms</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">varies, but in general anonymity carries the benefit of greater operating</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">freedom. Hackers are more inclined to share their results and findings if they know they can back away unscathed in case things get ugly. The use of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pseudonyms also levels the playing field. Hackers judge each other primarily on the basis of the quality and frequency of their contributions, and little else. The fact that you may be young does not detract from your first impression or street credibility, as it might in other situations. Likewise, many hackers have no qualms about being blunt when you’ve made an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">error, and they have even less patience for stupidity presented as erudition or rude assertions. On the other hand, many hackers are more than happy to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">extend a hand to those who have made an honest effort to read the FAQs,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">search the web and general y try their best to check and make sure that the question hasn’t already been answered.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_110"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Hacking Fora</b><br/></h3>

  <p>The Xbox hacking community has many civic fora for sharing their results <span style="font-size: 1em;">and airing their concerns. The most popular fora are web-based BBSes such</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as www.XboxHacker.net and www.xbox-scene.com, and IRC</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">channels such as #xboxhacker. Web-based BBSes typically feature news</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">logs, FAQs, and useful links to information. More importantly, BBSes</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">include fora where people can share information and post questions.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Through these fora, you can tap the collective knowledge of all the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hackers that frequent these BBSes. The logged history of these fora also</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contains a wealth of Xbox hacking information (and misinformation). I</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">encourage readers who have unanswered questions from this book to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">check out these fora for answers.</span></p>

  <p>One of the first Xbox hacking fora to be created was the XboxHacker BBS <span style="font-size: 1em;">(www.xboxhacker.net). Many of the best and brightest Xbox hackers</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">have contributed to its fora. For example, one of the forum threads</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">documents, in real-time, the adventures of Andy Green (known as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">numbnut on the XboxHacker BBS) as he hacked the version 1.1 security</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">scheme of the Xbox. I have learned much from reading the forum</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">postings of the XboxHacker BBS. I have also met some of the most</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">interesting people through the BBS fora. The founder of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacker BBS, Dan Johnson (also known as SiliconIce) tells his story</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in the sidebar “Profile: Dan Johnson.”</span></p>

  <p>Another resource for finding more information about the Xbox in general <span style="font-size: 1em;">is the web search engine Google (www.google.com). As more hackers</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">become involved with the Xbox, Google is becoming an increasingly</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">important tool for casting a wide net and discovering the latest tools and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">techniques. For example, at the time of writing Google started indexing a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">number of resources for replacement Xbox components. This can be useful</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">for those who do not want to go through the trouble of adapting an ATX</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">power supply to work with the Xbox.</span></p>

  <p>Try to use keywords that are as specific as possible when searching with <span style="font-size: 1em;">Google. For example, typing</span> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox hacking</b> <span style="font-size: 1em;">into Google will return a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">large number of links related to the general topic of Xbox hacking, but</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">few specifics. For example, today’s top hit on Google for “Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking” is a LWN.net article titled “LWN: Lindows CEO funds Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking contest (News.com).” This seems fairly removed from informa</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tion about how to install a new hard drive or the details about the Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security system. When narrowing down your search, try to figure out</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">what the de facto jargon and spelling is for your concept. Suppose you</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">are looking for information on the new Xbox security system. If you</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">search on</span> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">new Xbox</b><span style="font-size: 1em;">, you hardly get any technical information. How</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ever, if you search on</span> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">xbox v1.1</b> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the search returns many more useful technical results. One of the best ways to harvest the current jargon and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">acronyms is by browsing the hacking BBSes.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_111"><b class="calibre3">Making a Contribution</b></h3>

  <p>If you are looking for a way to contribute to the Xbox hacking community, <span style="font-size: 1em;">keep in mind that most hackers have a unique skill or strength that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">typically corresponds to his or her area of greatest interest, and that most hackers hack for fun. For example, I really enjoy hardware, especially</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">when it requires building something. Also, while I can write code, I don’t</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">particularly enjoy it. Thus, my contribution to the hacking community is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">primarily through hardware projects. Likewise, I have a hard time</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">motivating myself to engage in software projects. So, most of the time I</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">just sit back and enjoy watching what other people are doing on the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox. It is both educational and entertaining.</span></p>

  <p>When trying to think about what you can do for the Xbox hacking <span style="font-size: 1em;">community, don’t worry yourself about trying to jump in quickly and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">rush into a project that you aren’t in love with, or that you aren’t comfort</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">able executing. You will know when your time has arrived: the project will</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">just shout your name, and you will naturally be compelled to hack.</span></p>

    <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_112">Profile: Dan Johnson (a.k.a. SiliconIce)</h2>

    <p><b>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, and how you got into <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking?</span></b></p>

    <p>For some time, I had been interested in electronics hacking, <span style="font-size: 1em;">though for the most part my interest had been limited to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">merely reading about such feats. Hacked devices such as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Sega’s Dreamcast and the Netpliance I-Opener had</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">caught my attention from time to time. However, my first r</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">eal experience with electronics hacking came with the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“ePods,” a discontinued internet appliance/web-tablet device.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">I read about these interesting devices online and found my</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">way to Ken Segler’s I-Appliance BBS (http://www.linux-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">hacker.net), home of the famous I-Opener hacks. After read</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ing about the neat things people were doing with these tab</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">lets, I was intrigued and spent a good deal of my saved up</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">money at the time ($200) on one of the units. After receiving</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">my new toy, I spent a lot of time performing many of the docu</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">mented hacks, mostly software based. This was to be my first</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">glimpse into the world of electronics hacking. After the ePods,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">I moved on to another internet appliance, the Gateway Con</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">nected Touchpad. A slick-looking 10" touchscreen with a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">400MHz Crusoe and 96MB RAM housed behind it; it looked</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">like a great deal and perfect for a fun project. The device ran</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a custom build of Linux for AOL off of a 32MB CompactFlash</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">card. I swapped this out with a Microdrive and after much</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">swapping of this disk between laptops and USB readers and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Gateway, the device booted a pared down version of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Windows using “98Lite.” The device seemed perfect for use as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a finger-operated, network-attached mp3 jukebox (among</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">other things) so I began working on a custom player that would</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">allow easy operation via the touchpad. The whole Gateway</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">experience made for a neat summer project between my Jun</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ior and Senior years of high school.</span></p>

    <p><b>How did the XboxHacker BBS come about?</b></p>

    <p>It was during this time period that I got the idea for <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacker.Net. To me, the Xbox seemed to have the po</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tential to be the ideal computing device for under the TV . . .</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as soon as it could be programmed. The hardware was most</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">impressive for the time, and more than adequate for what I</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hoped would be accomplished on the device. Unlike other</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">consoles, the Xbox also was to have a hard drive and ethernet</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">port built in. Once hacked, the Xbox could be used to emu</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">late old consoles such as NES, SNES, N64, and even PSX, to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">conveniently play back any type of media file, such as mp3s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">or DivXs, on your home entertainment system, to play streamed</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">media from a home network, or even to double as a basic</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">PC. Some argued that the cost of the device at $299 made it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">out of range to bother hacking, as a PC with similar specs</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">could be constructed without the need for hacking for not</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">much more in cost. However, the Xbox had the advantage</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that it could also play Xbox games and was already designed</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to sit with your TV. The hacks would just be added value. After</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">my short foray into the world of electronics hacking, I thought</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that hacking the Xbox could be an interesting project to help</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">organize as I was intrigued by the possibility of having a con</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">venient box for my TV to perform the tasks mentioned above.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">It was not until many months later that I would actually ac</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">quire the XboxHacker.Net domains.</span></p>

    <p><b><span style="font-size: 1em;">How was your experience growing and running the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacker BBS?</span></b></p>

    <p>From the beginning, XboxHacker.Net focused on a few pri<span style="font-size: 1em;">mary goals: providing and spreading technical informa</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tion about the Xbox, and providing a place for fellow hack</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ers to discuss technical information related to hacking the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox. Though due to my limited technical knowledge and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">experience I could do little in the way of actual hacking to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contribute to the effort, I knew plenty enough to help facili</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tate the effort by collecting and distributing relevant infor</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">mation and moderating a discussion board.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Not long after the site launched, we were fortunate enough</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to receive some links from such high-profile websites as Mike</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Magee’s The Inquirer and Van Smith’s Van’s Hardware. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacker.Net BBS quickly became one of the primary places</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">on the Internet to discuss any material related to hacking the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox and the XboxHacker.Net news page had the most up</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">to-date news on the status of the Xbox. A few weeks after the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">site came online, it received mention in an article on CNET,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and from then on the activity level steadily increased. It wasn’t</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">long before XboxHacker.Net had outgrown the small shared</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">server we were on, so the site moved to a much larger ac</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">count which was also outgrown in a matter of weeks. Traffic</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to the forums continued to increase rapidly, so I made the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">decision to move the site to its own dedicated server where</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">we could have room to grow and not worry about every few</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">MBs of bandwidth usage or how many concurrent forum us</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ers were online.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: medium;">It didn’t take long before the activities of XboxHacker.Net <span style="font-size: 1em;">captured the attention of Microsoft. Early in the site’s his</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tory, I was contacted a couple of times with requests to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">remove materials. The first instance was of a screenshot of a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">developer tool I had received without much explanation</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that showed “security sectors” on the disks. The second in</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">stance was a request to remove a link someone had posted</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in the forums to a BIOS image of the Xbox. Aside from these</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">few minor incidents, contact between Microsoft and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacker.Net was virtually non-existent. It was made a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">policy early on to steer clear of issues of questionable legality</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">such as discussion about the backing up of games, linking to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyrighted materials, or posting Microsoft code from the BIOS.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: medium;">In the beginning, though interest was high, progress seemed <span style="font-size: 1em;">to be relatively slow . . . there was not a lot that could be done</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with the Xbox before the security was broken. There were many</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">individuals who contributed notably early on. Some of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">earliest contributors to the XboxHacking world were Andy and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Luke, whose Web-pages contained a plethora of information</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">on file formats and other valuable tidbits of Xbox information.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Steve “SurferDude” Gehlbach contributed to the design of a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">VGA converter circuit for the Xbox and Ken Gasper improved</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">on this to create a true VGA adapter for the Xbox. Bunnie’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">early analysis and hardware info page generated interest in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxHacking as well after its appearance on Slashdot. Indeed,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">there are numerous others who made their mark as well. Privi</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">leged to count such skilled hackers among the contributing</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">members on the boards, XboxHacker.Net grew into a hub for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technical Xbox information, discussion, and news.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: medium;">The crown jewel of XboxHacker.Net has no doubt always been <span style="font-size: 1em;">the XboxHacker BBS. The site was centered around the forums</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and activities of our members. Often, the latest XboxHacking</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">news would simply be links to forum topics and clips from posts</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">made by our members. The purpose of the forums was to en</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">able the diverse, multi-national group of people interested in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking the Xbox to work together towards this common goal.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">The forums provided a great place to share information and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">discuss ideas with fellow hackers and also served to bring to</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">gether many talented hackers who may otherwise have had</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">no means of collaborating. It was a great feeling to watch</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the progress that the forums enabled. One particular discus</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sion that comes to mind took place over the course of several</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">days. A number of members were discussing the new security</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">system in the second generation Xbox, looking for flaws and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ways around it. It was exciting to watch the events unfold as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hackers got closer to the solution and eventually broke the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security on the revised Xbox. Our hundreds of contributing</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">forum members were in large part responsible for the success</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of XboxHacker.Net and the progress of the XboxHacking world</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in general.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: medium;">Besides the activity on the XboxHacker.Net BBS, there were no <span style="font-size: 1em;">doubt many other groups working to hack the Xbox in secret.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">One such group I knew of on IRC contained contributing fo</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">rum members as well as others from the electronics hacking</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">underground. Names here will go unmentioned. Many bits of i</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">nformation from independent groups or individuals were re</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">layed to me for reporting over time. However, despite the grow</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ing interest in XboxHacking and the number of people in</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">volved in the effort, it would be some time before any major</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">breakthroughs became public knowledge.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: medium;">The XboxHacking scene picked up pace fairly rapidly after <span style="font-size: 1em;">the public availability of modchips near summer 2002. By this</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">time, the Xbox security system had been cracked by multiple</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">groups and it was only a matter of time before modchips were</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">readily available to the public. At this point, the work shifted</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">away from hardware hacking for the most part and more to</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">wards software development. A sister site to XboxHacker.Net,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">XboxDeveloper (http://www.xboxdeveloper.net) was started</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to help catalog the software that became available for the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox, though it never took off to the level that XboxHacker.Net</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">did. Using leaked copies of the Microsoft Xbox SDK, program</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">mers began writing and porting various applications for the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox, including media players and emulators such as MAME.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">The Xbox-Linux project (http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">) under the leadership of Michael Steil, successfully allowed</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Linux operating system to run on the Xbox. I pushed to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">start the OpenXDK project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">openxdk/), an open source developer kit that would allow de</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">velopment of software for the Xbox unhindered by legal is</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sues, though that project has met with only mixed success. It is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">now under the leadership of “Caustik” (Aaron Robinson), a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">CS student at Case Western University. Due to the more acces</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sible nature of software development compared with hard</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ware hacking, the number of contributing members to the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">general XboxHacking effort increased rapidly. The amount of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“homebrew” software available for the Xbox today is amaz</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ing and includes everything from media players, console</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">emulators, and utilities to originally written games.</span></p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_113"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Trusted Computing</b><br/></h2>

  <p>Trust is the cornerstone of security, and in order to have faith in your <span style="font-size: 1em;">security system, you need to have faith in the hardware and software you are running. The trusted computer is a machine that has been architected to be r</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">esistant to attacks that could compromise the trustability of the machine.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">There are many approaches to building a trustable computer, from the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Automated Teller Machine model of physical security and tamper-resistance,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to less hardware intensive solutions such as those used in the Xbox. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox fits into the broader picture of trusted computing since it is one of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the first high-profile, widely-deployed trusted PC implementations. In a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">way, the Xbox gives us a hint of what we might expect down the road for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trusted computing,</span></p>

  <p>Trusted computing is a potentially disruptive emerging technology. The rise of trusted clients in an ad-hoc network like the Internet harbors the promise of enabling safe and private on-line financial transactions, of reducing or eliminating the occurrence of computer viruses, and of reducing or eliminating spam email. Trusted PCs can also be used to securely store sensitive data, such as your medical and financial records and your naughty or embarrassing secrets. Another application of trusted PCs is to reliably enforce digital content access rights and management policies upon users. The digital rights management (DRM) aspect of trusted computing could fundamentally <span style="font-size: 1em;">change the way we use computers today; many of us enjoy the benefits of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pseudo-free content and flexible copyright implementations. The funda</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">mental problem is not the existence of content management policies —</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">indeed, content management policy can be beneficial for consumers. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">real problem is when the policies which govern your rights can be set</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">unilateral y by content providers. In the current trusted PC proposals, the user is not trusted to have control over certain key secrets inside their</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">machines. Instead, the attestation information (information required to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">establish trustability) of a user’s machine is partial y maintained by a third party. Can we rely on a non-elected, unregulated third party with business interests to determine who can do business, send email, and otherwise be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">recognized as a trustable entity?</span></p>

  <p>Trusted computing is like a gun. It’s great to have one as long as you’re the one controlling the trigger. Unfortunately, many trusted PC opponents fear that in practice, systems will be deployed with preset rights, policies and third-party trust affirmation resources pointed in the wrong direction for <span style="font-size: 1em;">consumers. A company, during good times, may set the privacy and security</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">policy in favor of users to attract a larger customer base, but once Chapter 11</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">comes knocking, or the company is sold or otherwise changes hands, these</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">policies can and will shift. What is to prevent businessmen from promoting</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trusted computing initially with user-friendly policies, and then suddenly</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">shifting into a wallet-squeezing DRM mode? Ethics?</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_114"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Taking a Step Back</b><br/></h3>

  <p>There is a problem with the phrase “trusted computing”: it has become <span style="font-size: 1em;">synonymous with cryptographically secured trusted computers. Let’s take a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">step back and just talk about alternative approaches to building trusted</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">computers.</span></p>

  <p>Trustability has always been important in computers. However, back in <span style="font-size: 1em;">the early days of computing, machines were so expensive that the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardware necessary to enforce strong trust policies was not within the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">reach of consumers. For example, many early machines shipped with a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">socket for a hardware Memory Management Unit (MMU) chip. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">MMU was one of the first steps toward trustable hardware memory</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">models; part of an MMU’s job is to enforce page-level memory access</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">protections. MMUs were sold as an option because they were quite pricey</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">at the time. Unfortunately, the move toward trustable hardware stopped</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">at the MMU, partially because computer networks didn’t exist in any m</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ajor form until relatively recently. In a non-networked world, data</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">needed to be protected only from programmer errors and from access</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">by a few select users with physical access to the machine. Today, comput</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ers need something stronger than just an MMU, something that can</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">provide trust in the face of viruses and remote attackers attempting to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">exploit subtle software weaknesses to run malicious code.</span></p>

  <p>The natural extension to the MMU’s hardware-enforced paged virtual <span style="font-size: 1em;">memory model might be address capabilities with a tagged memory model.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">A memory tag is a set of bits that record the type of data or code stored in a memory location. In a tagged memory model, every memory location has a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">set of tag bits, kind of like how every memory location in a conventional</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">error-correcting memory implementation is associated with some ECC bits.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Tag bits help the hardware enforce data type management policies; for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">example, a memory location tagged as piece of data can never be accidentally or intentionally executed as code. A capability is a pointer granted by a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trusted kernel that cannot be forged. The unforgeability property is preferably enforced by hardware through tag bits. Many architectures also include the ability to enforce access boundaries as part of a hardware capability.<sup>1</sup></span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Capabilities and memory tags are not new ideas; in 1961, the Burroughs</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">B5000 used capabilities (then called descriptors) and tagged memory to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">guard, in hardware, against buffer overflow attacks, and to isolate code</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">from data.<sup>2</sup> The MIT PDP-1, Intel i432, IBM System/38, and the Mach</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and Amoeba operating systems also implemented capabilities in some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">form, and this is by no means a complete list of systems that have used</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">capabilities or tagged memory. The security properties of capabilities</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">have also been demonstrated in many academic studies, such as the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">EROS (Extremely Reliable Operating System).</span><sup>3</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Unfortunately, capabili</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ties and tagged memory never made their way into the heart of main</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">stream PC architecture. Security and reliability has always taken a back</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">seat to cost, backward-compatibility, and performance.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">This brief history lesson demonstrates that trusted computing does not</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">require</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the cryptographic approach that is being proposed today by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Palladium and the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA). In fact,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptography on its own does not provide any security. Secure key</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">management is really what provides all the security in Palladium/TCPA.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Cryptographic algorithms simply transfer the security of the key into the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">user’s domain.</span></p>

  <p>This being said, one can draw an analogy between a capability and a <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptographic key. Both require a trusted OS to manage their creation,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">dissemination and destruction. Both are equally weak if the system</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cannot protect against forged keys or capabilities. The big difference is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that if a secret key leaks, all security is lost, eternally. On the other hand, capabilities are created and destroyed dynamically, so the leakage of a capability might lead to a security breach, but the scope and duration of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the breach is limited. To this extent, capabilities provide a more robust</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">solution for computer security.</span></p>

  <p>Note that relying solely on cryptographic techniques for hardware <span style="font-size: 1em;">security still leaves machines open to classic buffer-overrun style attacks and security holes due to programming errors. “Measurements” of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">software’s state help mitigate this weakness by detecting code alterations</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">before executing security-critical operations, but measurements are not a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">perfect solution. On the other hand, buffer-overrun attacks are impos</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sible in systems using hardware enforced capabilities with bounds</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">checking.</span></p>

  <p>Memory tags can also be used to implement security features that are not <span style="font-size: 1em;">feasible using a purely cryptographic approach to trusted computing. One</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">example is the trustable concurrent processing of compartmentalized</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">secrets.</span><sup>4</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In this example, multiple threads with varying levels of security clearance are operating on a single processor. The hardware enforces a policy where all threads impress their security level upon the data that they access.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In other words, every computation simultaneously operates in two</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">domains: the conventional arithmetic domain, and the security domain.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Suppose an unclassified thread adds two unclassified numbers and creates</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a piece of data named</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">.</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">’s security tag is also computed in parallel with the add arithmetic operation. In this case, the security tag’s result is “unclassified.” Now, suppose a top-secret thread touches</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">:</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">’s security tag now changes to “top secret.” Unclassified threads can no longer read</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">, even if the unclassified thread has a valid pointer to</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">;</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">foo</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">must be explicitly reclassified before it can be read again by unclassified threads.</span></p>

  <p>Such a strictly compartmentalized security system can be used, for <span style="font-size: 1em;">example, to ensure that no internal kernel structures are ever accessible to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">user processes, even in the presence of bugs and memory leaks (including</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">scenarios where kernel memory is deallocated and reassigned to a user</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">process without a memory clearing step). This scheme can also be used to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">establish security audit trails which are useful for helping programmers to trace the root cause of a security breach, and as damage control measures</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in case of a security breach.</span></p>

  <p>To be fair, one advantage of the cryptographic approach to trusted <span style="font-size: 1em;">computing is that if a rogue does get hold of data through some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardwares means — by eavesdropping on the hardware or stealing a hard</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive — the data cannot be deciphered. However, users can elect to use</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptography for data protection in any computer implementation,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">including those using hardware capabilities and tagged memory. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">problem of secure key management is still a difficult problem, but</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">perhaps it can be solved in part by integrating cryptographic smart card</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">readers into PCs.</span></p>

  <p>There is no essential reason why a trusted PC implementation <i class="calibre4">must</i> use the cryptographic techniques proposed in Palladium and TCPA. The techniques reviewed in this section, namely capabilities and tagged memory, can be used to implement a secure, trustable PC in a manner that does not involve the <span style="font-size: 1em;">risk of users losing the ability to set their own access policies. Users would be in full control of their machine and their secrets at all times.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_115"><b class="calibre3">Palladium Versus TCPA</b></h3>

  <p>There is much confusion these days about the current trusted PC proposals, <span style="font-size: 1em;">namely Microsoft’s Pal adium and the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(TCPA). There are enough similarities between the two proposals that many</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">people think they are one and the same, but the goals of each initiative</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">are different.</span></p>

  <p>The TCPA is a multi-corporation alliance to create computers with some <span style="font-size: 1em;">nominal amount of trust. Significantly, much of its specifications can also be applied to non-PC platforms. In TCPA the trust is planted in a secure</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardware module called the TPM (Trusted Platform Module). The TPM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contains features to ensure that the secrets contained within the module</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">are never leaked through software attacks. It also contains features, such</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as secured system “measurements,” that attempt to transfer the trust</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contained within the TPM to the host machine.</span></p>

  <p>Palladium, on the other hand, is a whole-system PC-centric security <span style="font-size: 1em;">concept created by Microsoft alone. One of its components is a TPM-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">like security module, but Palladium also calls for sweeping changes to the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardware chipset and the way I/O ports are implemented. The chipset is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">required to enforce memory security policies from all potential DMA s</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ources, such as the graphics card. Palladium also calls for encryption of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the I/O to the keyboard and video subsystems.</span></p>

  <p>Palladium’s requirement for cooperation between chipset vendors, OEMs <span style="font-size: 1em;">and Microsoft is a potentially large flaw. There isn’t enough margin in the commodity PC hardware industry today to support the overhead of an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">extensive cryptographic security overhaul. Too, many chipset vendors do</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">not have any experience with implementing secure systems. On top of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">language barrier faced by many overseas chipset vendors, chipsets are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">usually developed on a short fuse and with a keen eye on the pocketbook.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Can chipsets developed under these conditions be expected to protect</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">sensitive secrets?</span></p>

  <p>The Xbox is an example of what can go wrong when security policies are <span style="font-size: 1em;">defined by one body and implemented by another very different organi</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">zation. Microsoft wrote a specification for a trustable piece of hardware, namely, the Xbox. Strong cryptographic algorithms are used liberally in the Xbox, and the master key for the system is locked deep inside a complex piece of silicon. However, experience has demonstrated that the Xbox’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security system can be bypassed using a combination of an unsecured debug</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">port, a flaw in the hardware initialization scheme, and a bug in the handling of a boundary case of the instruction pointer in the CPU. These three minor oversights, committed by three independent parties (the assembly contractor, the Xbox firmware designer, and Intel), conspire to provide a convenient method for defeating Xbox security.</span></p>

  <p>Each of these oversights on their own does not represent a significant <span style="font-size: 1em;">security problem. This leads to the disconcerting question of how many</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security breaches in a particular Palladium implementation will be caused by the stacking of multiple benign flaws. Every complex consumer electronics</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">system has minor bugs or design oversights, especially when systems are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">composed of components built by multiple independent entities whose</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">primary interest is in turning a profit.</span></p>

  <p>In the consumer electronics industry, one can either ship a perfect <span style="font-size: 1em;">product, or one can make money. Products that don’t make money are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">quickly cancelled. Thus, it is very rare to find a consumer product that is technically perfect in all respects. As a result, the only practical way to guarantee the security of consumer electronics system as complex as Palladium is to throw it into the wild, and let the hackers have their way w</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ith it for many years until all of the big security holes have been</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">discovered and plugged.</span></p>

  <p>On the other hand, the TCPA’s TPM is a device created to solve a certain <span style="font-size: 1em;">set of problems that is smaller in scope than Palladium’s. Thus, the TPM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">is not as exciting from a market perspective, but it may be more practical</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and serviceable for its intended purpose. Both the TPM and Palladium</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">are weak to hardware attacks, but the TPM doesn’t attempt to extend</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security requirements as far into third-party system design territory. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">TPM is primarily a secured key management module that can detect most</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">modifications and intrusions to the host system. The software layers built</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">on top of this substrate do the rest of the heavy lifting,</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">caveat emptor</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_116"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Hacking the Trusted PC</b><br/></h3>

  <p>The current proposals for the trusted PC are weak against some fairly simple hardware attacks, even in the absence of any integration oversight or bug-related back doors.</p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The first attack is one that I call the “</span><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">S</b><span style="font-size: 1em;">urre</span><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">p</b><span style="font-size: 1em;">titious B</span><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">IOS,</b> <span style="font-size: 1em;">” or SPIOS</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(pronounced “Spy OS”) attack. SPIOS can be used to defeat DRM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">policies that rely on the cryptographically sealed storage feature of the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trusted PC to prevent unauthorized user access to data. The basic idea is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to boot the PC with an unmodified BIOS into trusted mode and extract</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">all the desired data into system RAM, then to perform a warm reset of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the system while swapping the BIOS image.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The modified BIOS image can be used to read out the desired data from</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">system RAM. The desired data may be a session key stored in memory,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">or the actual decrypted data itself, depending upon how the program</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">structures and caches its data in memory. Since the current trusted PC</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">specifications call for an LPC bus based BIOS, inexpensive alternate</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">firmware devices (similar to those used on the Xbox) can be used to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">execute this attack. There are techniques that application programmers</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">can use to complicate this attack, such as only decrypting a single block</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of data each time into system memory, but many of these techniques</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">severely degrade system performance. The degradation of system</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">performance may be especially pronounced if file caching and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">prefetching is disabled.</span></p>

  <p>Another attack is one that I cal the <b class="calibre3">“S</b>urre<b class="calibre3">p</b>titious R<b class="calibre3">AM</b>,” or SPAM <span style="font-size: 1em;">attack. The goal of this attack is to spoof the trusted routines responsible for measuring the fitness of the system state. A device, such as an FPGA</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">or ASIC, is installed on the plug-in memory cards in between the DRAM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chips and the memory connector. This device monitors the pattern of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">addresses going by, or it may have an extra connector that sniffs the state of the wires connected to the I/O pins of the cryptomodule responsible</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">for authenticating the system.</span></p>

  <p>Either way, when a system measurement is in progress, the SPAM device <span style="font-size: 1em;">presents a memory image that is consistent with an unmodified, trusted</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">system state. However, during all other operating modes, the SPAM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">device presents a memory image that is modified to do whatever the user</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pleases. This modification can be very subtle: Just a couple of bits flipped at the right locations is all it takes to modify key branch instructions in the security kernel.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">This device is more powerful than the SPIOS since it works on a system</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that is powered-up and supposedly trustworthy. It can be applied to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">effectively defeat a wider range of DRM schemes as well as some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">authenticated transactions between the local machine and the server.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">SPAM alone cannot be used, however, to falsely identify a system as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">another registered, trusted system, since SPAM lacks the secret shared</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">between the tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule in the local machine</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and the authentication server. False system identification would require</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">either extracting the key from a tamper-resistant secure cryptomodule</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(possible, but not trivial and most likely destructive to the module), or</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">somehow tricking a secure cryptomodule from another registered,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trusted machine into providing the falsified identity.</span></p>

  <p>The SPAM device can be manufactured for relatively little (high perfor<span style="font-size: 1em;">mance FPGAs can cost as little as $50 today in single quantities), and can</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">be very easy to install. The SPAM can be either integrated directly into a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">memory module (in which case it functions as both a trust violation</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">device and as a memory expansion device), or it can be provided as a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">device that is installed in a stacked configuration in between the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">motherboard’s memory slot and the existing memory device. In some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">memory card configurations, particularly ones that employ heat shields, it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">may be possible to hide the SPAM device and pass the module off as a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">regular memory expansion device. While elaborate, this may be a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">worthwhile attack against a large corporation or bank that stores high-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">value secrets on a trusted PC-based server.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_117"><b class="calibre3">Looking Forward</b></h3>

  <p>When considering the prospect of trusted computing, we need to first <span style="font-size: 1em;">consider whether the currently proposed schemes will offer all the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">benefits that they promise, and then weigh those against the potential</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">harm to consumers’ rights and the potential benefits to criminals</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(enhanced privacy can be used for both good and ill). If trusted comput</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ing could provide perfect security for online businesses, then that might</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">be worth the potential risks. However, the scenarios outlined in this</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chapter indicate that the trusted PC’s security may be less than perfect.</span></p>

  <p>Consider the Xbox. The Xbox is a trusted PC implementation that can <span style="font-size: 1em;">be hacked with just a $50 solderless module. This places a fairly strong</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">bound on the value of secrets that can be trusted to an Xbox. Hardware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">modchips are so inexpensive that they pay for themselves with the cost of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a copied game title, or two games if you elect to pay someone to install</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the chip for you.</span></p>

  <p>Of course, there are always the moral and social implications of stealing <span style="font-size: 1em;">content too, as well as new legislation, such as the DMCA, which aims in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">part to make such acts a crime. Unfortunately, the current trusted PC</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">proposals on the table are also weak in the face of similarly inexpensive</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardware attacks. Thus, it is unlikely that they will provide the level of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">security required for high-value or very embarrassing secrets.</span></p>

  <p>The fact of the matter is that hacking technology will be developed <span style="font-size: 1em;">whether or not it is illegal, and whether or not the intention is good or</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">evil. Thus, it is in the best interests of consumers and companies to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">educate the population about hacking, and for everyone to understand</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the limitations of their “trusted PC.” The worst-case scenario would be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">if billions of dollars were invested in trusted computing, only produce a net result of no greater safety or privacy for consumers, while severely</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">curtailing consumers’ rights with poor content policy implementations.</span></p>

  <p>The good news for trusted PC proponents is that shrinking feature sizes <span style="font-size: 1em;">in integrated circuits is driving greater integration throughout the PC.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Within a decade, today’s PC will fit on a single piece of silicon. Once the RAM and the BIOS are fully integrated into a single piece of silicon,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking a system becomes much more difficult — but not impossible.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Focused Ion Beam (FIB) machines, a tool used by chip designers and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">failure analysis labs, can cut and jumper nano-scale features. Another</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">upside for for trusted machine designers is that public key processors</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">could become so small and cheap to integrate into a chip that individual</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chips, especially memory chips, could start using strong crypto to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">authenticate and encrypt their I/O.</span></p>

  <p>Another technology that could aid the implementation of trusted PCs is <span style="font-size: 1em;">integrated tamper-resistant or tamper-detecting features. For example, a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">time-domain reflectometer (TDR) could be built into a chip’s I/O cells.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">A TDR can detect the presence of an eavesdropper on a wire by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">recognizing certain changes to the wire’s electrical properties. In addition to the ability to detect eavesdroppers, integrated TDR devices are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">desirable for high performance I/O since they can be used to calibrate</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the drive impedance and equalization/pre-emphasis filters required for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">multi-gigabit speed communications.</span></p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_118"><b class="calibre3">Concluding Thoughts</b></h2>

  <p>This book has taken you through a whistle-stop tour of Xbox hardware <span style="font-size: 1em;">hacking, from the basics of soldering and disassembling to the latest</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">projects and techniques. It has also introduced you to the social aspects</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of Xbox hacking: the people who hack, and the interplay between</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">society, law, and hacking.</span></p>

  <p>While the details of how to install a blue LED in an Xbox may be <span style="font-size: 1em;">irrelevant in a few years, the skills you learn executing the installation will last a lifetime. Moreover, the social and legal issues confronting hackers and consumers will extend beyond the Xbox and into every part of our</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">emerging information-centric way of life.</span></p>

  <p>The material in this book is just a starting point; there is a world of <span style="font-size: 1em;">hardware out there waiting to be explored. I hope this book has pro</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">vided the novice readers with a strong starting point for becoming an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">explorer, fixer, and innovator in a world increasingly filled with, con</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">trolled by, and dependent upon electronics.</span></p>

  <p>Happy hacking!</p>
