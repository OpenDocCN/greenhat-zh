    and of any regional encoding. This is a better setup than the DVD player you have
    hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of stand-alone DVD players in
    the United States (I would venture to guess 99.9 percent) do not allow you to
    play anything other than Region 1 NTSC discs (NTSC being the broadcast standard
    in the United States and what its televisions are designed to display, while the
    DVD region is 1). This information is usually provided on the back of DVD packages
    (see the examples in [Figure 16-1](ch16s02.html#examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on
    "Figure 16-1. Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages")), though
    the packaging for most discs produced for the U.S. market does not include it.

- en: Despite the wonderful everything-goes nature of your computer in terms of DVD
    playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the manufacturer
    of your DVD drive, you will be able to switch back and forth between DVDs of differing
    regional encodings only four or five times. After that, the drive will be locked
    into the regional encoding of the disc you were playing at that time . . . *forever*.
    This is unrelated to your operating system—it is strictly a hardware matter. The
    only exception to this region-lock rule are those DVDs labeled *Region Free* or
    *ALL* (sometimes inaccurately labeled as *Region 0*), which can be played on any
    DVD player in any region and thus do not register as a regional encoding switch
    when you plop one of them in your computer's DVD drive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially one
    for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That news comes in the form
    of Videolan's *libdvdcss2*, the library that is included in the libdvdread4 package
    you installed in Project 16A.The libdvdcss2 library allows you to play back encrypted
    DVDs. In addition to that primary function, *libdvdcss2* also, in theory, allows
    you to play back DVDs from multiple regions even if your DVD drive is already
    locked into one region. It does this by performing a cryptic attack (to use Videolan's
    term for it) on your drive until it can find the disc key for that drive. Of course,
    this process of cryptic bombardment can take several minutes, so it is not the
    optimal way of going about things. It's better than being stuck, though. Whether
    this process of bypassing regional encodings is legal remains a subject of debate,
    so if you are concerned about such things, you should do a little research.
