    be a challenge. Fortunately, search is a powerful technology. This chapter will
    explain how to search Wikipedia effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But searching for a specific piece of information is not the only way to use
    Wikipedia. Unlike the sections in a printed book, Wikipedia articles are not in
    any particular order; instead, they can be bundled together by topic and in many
    other ways. This grouping makes it great fun to browse Wikipedia casually and
    facilitates chance discovery: Filling out your understanding of a topic''s background
    is usually painless, and one topic can lead to another in a surprising and enjoyable
    way.'

    research and navigation skills will help you make the most of your time. Therefore,
    this chapter will also describe the key structures set up for browsing (portals,
    categories, and lists) and will explain some basic navigational tools, including
    the links on the website's left-hand sidebar.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're looking for a particular topic, name, or phrase, searching the site
    directly is the way to start. Wikipedia's search function is like consulting the
    index volume of an encyclopedia, minus the tedium. In the best cases, you are
    only a few seconds away from answering a query.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you search Wikipedia, you're harnessing a powerful combination of technologies—the
    organic growth of the encyclopedia itself and the ability to sift instantly through
    hundreds of millions of words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Wikipedia search engine searches not only the titles of all two million
    articles but also their full text. The search engine also includes alternate article
    titles (*redirect titles*). (In addition, you can search Wikipedia pages that
    are not articles, as we'll explain.) The search engine works on the current database,
    so it will find even the newest articles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a search doesn't turn up anything, Wikipedia may not have let you down. Sometimes
    finding what you're looking for can take persistence. You can make your searches
    more focused, broad, or powerful. Learning about the structure of the site and
    the conventions governing how articles are named will also make your searches
    more worthwhile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, search doesn't cover all situations. For example, you may suspect that
    you are using the wrong spelling. You could be looking for a medical term that
    you would recognize in context but can't remember. Or you might want to know what
    topics are related to a particular academic field. In those cases, start by browsing
    categories and portals, as described in "Browsing by Topic" on [Browsing by Topic](#browsing_by_topic
    "Browsing by Topic").

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes Go searches don't end up where you expect—especially when redirects
    are involved! Plural search terms can be especially problematic, as article titles
    usually use the singular form. For example, there is no article titled Beatle—if
    you enter the word *Beatle*, you are taken instead to [[The Beatles]]. But searching
    for Rolling Stone doesn't take you to [[The Rolling Stones]]; it takes you to
    [[Rolling Stone]], an article about the magazine. [[Trogg]] has nothing to do
    with [[The Troggs]] but instead redirects to [[List of characters in Sonic the
    Comic]]. Who knew? If you've been redirected, a notice will appear under the article's
    title in parentheses. If you don't get what you expect, a full-text search might
    help you find the article you're looking for. (And sometimes an article will helpfully
    point you toward unrelated articles with similar names.)

- en: If you can't find an article about a topic but you feel sure it must exist in
    Wikipedia, try a full-text search using different keywords. For instance, the
    article titled [[Flag of the United States]] could also be titled [[American Flag]],
    [[The US Flag]], or any of a dozen similar things. You will often be redirected
    to the proper article—but not always. Redirects will take you to similar articles
    only in the most popular and developed areas of Wikipedia, so searching for synonyms
    is also important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Searching for articles about people can be particularly tricky. The titles of
    biographical articles are supposed to be standardized (*first name, last name*,
    according to [[Wikipedia:Naming Conventions]], shortcut WP:NAME), but often vary
    in practice, especially if the name contains a combination of initials. If you're
    trying to track down John Karl Doe, a nonfiction writer, start by searching for
    *John Doe*, but also search for *Doe, John* as well as *J.K. Doe*, *J. Doe*, and
    *Doe, J*. Contributors also bring their own referencing styles to the site, which
    may invert or shorten names, or mistakes can creep in (like *Carl* for *Karl*).
    In the end, you might only find the article [[John C. Doe]] with persistence,
    perhaps as a redirect from *Doe, JK*. For less common names, searching for the
    last name only may get you what you're looking for and save much time in the end.
    This technique is particularly true for transliterated names or names with several
    historical spellings.

    portal page itself. (The articles in the portal are hand-selected and are usually
    accurate and interesting.) Most portals feature an introduction to the topic;

    changed many times. Stone carvings were expensive and time consuming (and decidedly
    nonportable) and were, therefore, used mostly for official state purposes. Medieval

    in the right county, where you'll find the title of the article you want. That
    journey is like going in and up and then down and out of the category system.

    may present some obstacles as you may need to download special software. The major

    files use the Ogg Theora format. These formats are broadly similar to others used
    to play digital audio and video, such as MP3 and MPEG, and can be played on almost
    all personal computers. Unlike MP3, QuickTime, and many other common formats,
    however, Ogg formats are completely free, open, and unpatented. Microsoft Windows
    and Mac OS X computers do not support Ogg formats by default and require additional
    software to play them. If your computer does not automatically play these files
    when you click them, you'll need to download and install free software from the
    Internet to play them. Go to [http://www.vorbis.com](http://www.vorbis.com) for
    links to versions of downloadable players or codecs suitable for common systems.

    files. For Linux/Unix users, many recent free Unix systems are able to play Vorbis
    audio without any new software; however, many media players are available if you
    don't have any audio software installed. [[Wikipedia:Media help (Ogg)]] has a

    the article you're looking for. You can configure Wikipedia's search to search
    multiple namespaces along with other options; you can also use external search
    engines. Access the search engine on the left-hand sidebar, which also includes
    a number of other links and tools. Some of these links and tools are consistent

    which show up as links at the bottom of pages that are categorized, provide a
    powerful way to browse through related pages, including pages categorized by quality
    (such as featured articles). Categories set up a classification system, with more
