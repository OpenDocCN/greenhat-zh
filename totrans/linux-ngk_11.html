<i class="calibre11">Compiling Programs from Source (Made Kind of Easy)</i><a name="491" id="491"/><a name="IDX-153" id="IDX-153"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">For the beginner, just the mention of  compiling a program from source seems  off-putting enough. The words <i class="calibre11">compile</i> and  <i class="calibre11">source </i>seem to instill a sense of foreboding in  the heart of the new user. That certainly was the  case for me, anyway. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">However, this method of installing programs is a lot easier than it sounds. In fact, now that you have some experience in using the Terminal and command line, it is just plain easy — a sort of one, two, three, and you’re done process.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, you can live long and prosper without ever bothering to compile anything on your system. You can move along quite happily with your system as is, or you  can just install programs by means of the very straightforward RPM method. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">However, not every bit of software out there is available in RPM format; and, if  you are filled with natural human curiosity, there will come a time when you will want  to move just one step beyond. After working through this short chapter, you will be  able to do just that, and I am sure you will find that your initial worries will have been  for naught.</p>

<a name="492" class="calibre15" id="492"/><a name="wbp13Chapter11P7" class="calibre15" id="wbp13Chapter11P7"/>What Is Source?</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In order to understand what <i class="calibre11">source</i> is, you should understand a bit about how a  program actually gets from its primitive state on the programmer’s computer to  an up-and-running application on your machine. First the programmer writes a  program in a programming language. You have probably heard of programming  languages such as Basic or C, and there are many others. What the programmer  actually writes with such a language is a set of instructions called the <i class="calibre11">source code</i>,  or <i class="calibre11">source</i>. Your computer, however, cannot actually understand any of that source  on its own. It is as if the computer speaks ancient Greek, and the source code is  all written in French. The computer therefore needs some sort of interpreter to  help it out.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The various languages that programmers use are called <i class="calibre11">high-level languages</i> —  they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, on the other  hand, only understands what are called <i class="calibre11">low-level languages</i>, which are quite difficult for most mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the high-level  language instructions to a low-level language, the computer needs some other  program to translate. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This can be done while a program is running, in which case the translator  program is called an <i class="calibre11">interpreter</i>. Applications that run using an interpreter are  usually called <i class="calibre11">scripts</i>. The pyWings application in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a> is an example of such  a script application. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The problem with such script applications is that they can be slower, because  the computer must run an interpreter, interpret the source code, and run the  actual application all at the same time. This is like having a French book translated to a Greek speaker by a live interpreter — very slow indeed. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As an alternative, many programs use a <i class="calibre11">compiler</i> instead of an interpreter. A  compiler translates the high-level source code into low-level <i class="calibre11">machine code</i>, or <i class="calibre11">object  code</i>, that the computer can understand before the application is actually run.  Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother with the high- level instructions again; it can merely read the translated version each and every  time it runs the program. This is like reading a translated version of a foreign  book that you can read any time you want to without assistance. Because computers can run compiled programs without simultaneously using an interpreter, compiled programs run faster. Most applications for all operating systems are,  therefore, compiled.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Almost all source packages come in the form of tarballs (tarballs and RPM files  are both referred to as <i class="calibre11">packages,</i> which is why the icon for such files looks like a  little parcel-post box). Tarballs, like ZIP files on Windows systems or StuffIt files  on the Mac, consist of a group of files, or even a single file, which have been compressed into one space-saving archive file. In Linux, the most common  method of creating such archives is through the tar program, from which the  tarball gets its name. Tar files, or tarballs, can be recognized by their file endings, which are .tar.gz or tar.bz2.<a name="494" id="494"/><a name="IDX-154" id="IDX-154"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may or may not realize it, but you have already used tarballs in two of the  previous chapters. In <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a> you dragged tarballs into your Theme Preferences window to install new window borders and control sets, and in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a>  you untarred a tarball (extracted the archived files) in order to set up and use  the pyWings application. The files archived in tarballs can be extracted by using  the command line, but to keep things easy, you can just use the simple double- click method that you used in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get some hands-on experience with compiling a program from source, you  will be working with a game called Xmahjongg. Now, you may think that, as you  already have a GNOME mahjongg game and a KDE mahjongg game (not listed  in the Main menu) installed on your system, having yet another mahjongg game  is a tad redundant, to say the least. Maybe so, but in terms of gaming, the  Xmahjongg game is easier on the eyes and snappier in performance. It looks  prettier too, in my opinion. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">More important than these gaming points, though, is the fact that the Xmahjongg package provides a perfect opportunity to learn to compile a program  from source and then install it. It is not too big, it doesn’t take too much time to  do, and it requires no tinkering. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can see what the final product will look like in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU112">Figure 11-1</a>.<a name="496" id="496"/><a name="IDX-155" id="IDX-155"/>

<span><span>Figure 11-1: </span> The Xmahjongg game</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see, it is all very simple and clearly laid out. In case you are not already  familiar with this genre of mahjongg game, the idea is simple enough. Basically  there are four of each tile in the pile. You must match pairs of like tiles that are  open to one side. When you click the two matching open tiles, they will dis- appear. The object of the game is, thus, to remove all the tiles from the board. A very simple solitaire game.<a name="498" id="498"/><a name="IDX-156" id="IDX-156"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To compile and install Xmahjongg, you are going to use seven commands:  <b class="calibre13">cd</b> (to get into the xmahjongg folder), <b class="calibre13">./configure</b> (to configure a makefile,  which provides instructions for the next command), <b class="calibre13">make</b> (to translate the  source code into object code that the computer can understand), <b class="calibre13">su</b> (to become  root), <b class="calibre13">make install</b> (to install the program),<b class="calibre13"> exit</b> (to get out of root mode), and  <b class="calibre13">make clean</b> (to clean up the mess). I know that sounds like a lot of commands,  but as I always say, it is easier to actually do than it looks like on the page, so  fear not.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The next step is sort of a setup phase that runs the configure script in the  xmahjongg-3.6.1 folder. The configure script checks what files, compilers,  and other things it needs, and then it searches your computer to see if those  things are there, and if so, where. Based on this information, it then writes a  file called <b class="calibre13">makefile</b>, which is a set of instructions that will tell the <b class="calibre13">make</b> command in the subsequent step how to set things up specifically for your system  configuration. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While you are running <b class="calibre13">configure</b>, you will see lots of odd and mysterious  things flowing down your Terminal window; this is essentially a running  account of what is going on, each step of the way. Depending on the program you are dealing with, this could take a bit of time — a few seconds or  a few minutes. Either way, you needn’t worry.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As a general rule, programs compiled from source do not automatically install  a launcher in your Main menu. Although you can run a program for the first  time by going to the Main menu, selecting <b class="calibre13">Run Program</b>, and then typing the  program name in the dialog box, it is better to run the program for the first  time by typing the command for the new program in your Terminal window.  If anything has gone amiss during installation, the Terminal will tell you what  the problem is, whereas the Run Program method would just leave you wondering what’s going on. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Usually the program’s command name is written in the INSTALL file or  the README file within the directory that was created when you extracted the  source files from the tarball (xmahjongg-3.6.1 in this case). Sometimes you  won’t find it there, but you can find it on the project page for that application  on the Internet. Other times, however, you can’t find it there either, so you’ll  just have to resort to guessing. Sometimes the hardest part of compiling a program from source is not, as you now know, compiling it, but rather finding out  what the command to run it is. Usually, it is just the name of the tarball, minus  the file endings. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It is time to make sure that all went well with the Xmahjongg program installation. In your Terminal window, type <span>xmahjongg</span> and press ENTER. If all is as it  should be, and there is no reason it shouldn’t, the Xmahjongg program will  open within seconds and all will be well. You can now goof around with the game  for a while, if you like, or get straight back to cleaning up, which is an easy  enough process.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you are all done compiling and installing your new application, you will  find that you have a lot of extra files in your original source folder that you no  longer need. As I mentioned before, the <b class="calibre13">make</b> command created translations of  all the source code files, and those low-level language versions of the files were  then installed in the <b class="calibre13">make install</b> step. Now that your installation is complete, you don’t need those files anymore; they have all been copied elsewhere. The  translated files in your source folder are just sitting there rudely wasting disk space. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Getting rid of these space wasters is simple enough, fortunately. The <b class="calibre13">make  clean</b> command will remove all the extraneous translated versions of your source  files. However, it sometimes happens that <b class="calibre13">make clean </b>will also clean out your  makefile, which is bad, because the makefile often allows you to uninstall the  program you’ve installed with it. Before running the <b class="calibre13">make clean</b> command,  therefore, it is a good idea to copy the makefile to the desktop. Then, once you  are done with <b class="calibre13">make clean</b>, you can check to see if the makefile is still in the  project folder or not. If it is, you can trash the makefile on your desktop. If the  makefile is not in the project folder, you can move the desktop makefile back  into that folder.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Here are the steps:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>cd xmahjongg-3.6.1</span> and hit ENTER to return to the xmahjongg-3.6.1  folder.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After <b class="calibre13">make clean</b> is finished with its tidying chores, you are done, and you  will have saved a bit of disk space.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s say that you installed a program through this compiling process, and you  don’t like or need it — you just want to get it out of there. Usually you can  uninstall the program, provided the pesky makefile is still there in the project  folder (hence my warning in the previous “Cleaning Up” section), with the <b class="calibre13">make  uninstall</b> command. You might first want to check out the INSTALL or README  file to see if <b class="calibre13">make uninstall</b> is supported or if there is another uninstall method.  Sometimes, however, the uninstall method is not specified, so you will just have  to give it a go to find out if <b class="calibre13">make uninstall</b> works or not. There is no danger in  this, because if it isn’t supported, nothing will happen.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Anyway, Xmahjongg is a good example. There is no information in either  the INSTALL or README files about uninstalling the program, so to find out  if you can use <b class="calibre13">make uninstall</b><i class="calibre11">,</i> you have to go through the more or less standard  steps:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Open a Terminal window and become root by typing <span>su</span> and pressing ENTER.  Then type your root password and press ENTER.</p>

<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>make uninstall</span> and press ENTER.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you’re done, you should see a stream of text flowing down your Terminal window for a few seconds. If you take a look at the text after it has  stopped flowing and you are back at the root prompt, you will see that it  actually consists of information that you now more or less understand: a  series of <b class="calibre13">cd</b>, <b class="calibre13">rm</b>, and <b class="calibre13">rmdir</b> commands. </p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To make sure that Xmahjongg really is uninstalled, type <span>exit</span> and press  ENTER to get yourself out of root mode, and then type <span>xmahjongg</span> and press  ENTER to try to run the program. You should be told that the command cannot be found. If this is the case, you have successfully rid your computer of  Xmahjongg.</p>
</li>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is basically the same way you would go about uninstalling any other package  that you originally installed in this non-RPM manner. If it works, it works, and if it  doesn’t . . . well, then you will have to read the makefile (by double-clicking it) to  see where everything was placed, and then trash all the files one by one. That’s a  big pain, and you might screw something up in the process, so I recommend you  just ignore the program instead, at least at this stage of the game. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Aha! Just as I expected; you are so overwhelmed by your sense of accomplishment that you’ve become hungry for more. To satisfy your desires, I will  give you another little project that you can do on your own. It is a two-parter  that will put more of your skills to work.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This do-it-yourself project is a goofy little desktop amusement called XPenguins.  The program releases an absolute swarm of penguins upon your desktop, where  they drop down by balloon, read books, march atop your windows and Panel, and even drill holes in things (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU115">Figure 11-4</a>). Admittedly, XPenguins is another one of those system resource wasters; it’s absolutely useless, but,  depending on your view of things, quite cute and amusing. If nothing else,  having all those penguins goofing around on your screen will give your system a  more Linux-ish look.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will need two different files for this project. The first is the actual XPenguins  program, which you can get from <a target="_top" href="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/xpenguins">http://dag.wieers.com/packages/xpenguins.</a>  On that page, just download the newest XPenguins file appropriate for your  system. If you added DAG to Synaptic’s list of repositories as I explained in  <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a>, you can also download the file by running Synaptic, typing <span>xpenguins </span>in Synaptic’s <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box, and then following the standard Synaptic installation  procedures. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The other file you will need is a GNOME Panel applet with which you can  release the penguins to scamper about your screen when you’re in the mood and  then get rid of them once they begin to annoy you. To get this file, go to the  XPenguins project homepage at <a target="_top" href="http://www.xpenguins.seul.org">http://www.xpenguins.seul.org.</a> Once there,  download <b class="calibre13">xpenguins-applet-2.1.0.tar.gz</b> (the GNOME Panel applet). If you happen to be using Red Hat Linux 8, get <b class="calibre13">xpenguins-applet-2.0.1.tar.gz</b> instead  of 2.1.0.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="515" id="515"/><a name="IDX-161" id="IDX-161"/>The first step is to install the <b class="calibre13">xpenguins RPM</b> as you learned to do in <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a>. Once you’ve done that, extract the <b class="calibre13">xpenguins-applet-2.1.0.tar.gz</b> tarball, <span>cd</span> to the new folder that was created when you extracted the tarball, and then follow the steps you’ve learned in this chapter: <b class="calibre13">./configure</b>, <b class="calibre13">make</b>, <b class="calibre13">make install</b>, and <b class="calibre13">make  clean</b>, but in this case, per the instructions in the INSTALL file, instead of just  typing <span>./configure</span>, type this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc </pre>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You could simply run XPenguins by typing <span>xpenguins</span> in the Run Command window or the Command Terminal, but if you did that, getting rid of your new,  pesky little friends would be more of a chore. Instead, add the XPenguins applet,  which you’ve just compiled, to the GNOME Panel by right-clicking the Panel and  selecting <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Amusements </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> XPenguins</b> in the pop-up menu. If  XPenguins doesn’t appear in the menu straightaway, try again the next time you  restart your machine.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">With this Panel applet (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU116">Figure 11-5</a>), you can bring on the penguins by  clicking the top button, and then send them back where they came from by clicking the bottom button. A very convenient arrangement, to be sure.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="519" id="519"/><a name="IDX-162" id="IDX-162"/>If you like the concept of XPenguins, but not the penguins themselves, right- click the XPenguins Panel applet and select <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> in the pop-up menu.  In the Properties window, click the<b class="calibre13"> Themes</b> tab, and you will find a few non- penguin alternatives. If none of these satisfies you, you can go back to the  XPenguins project page and download an additional package that contains  several cartoon-character themes, such as the Simpsons. The theme package  is available as a tarball, but for convenience’s sake, just download the RPM file  <b class="calibre13">xpenguins_themes-1.0-1.noarch.rpm</b> and install it.</p>
