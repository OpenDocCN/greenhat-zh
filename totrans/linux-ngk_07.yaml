- en: 'When the original Macintosh first came out, one of the coolest things about
    it was that it used 3.5-inch floppy disks (aka floppies). At the time, I thought
    that those disks, with their hard casing and sliding metal doors protecting the
    media itself, were the incarnation of high-tech cool. Times change, of course,
    and there are fewer and fewer people using floppies these days. The reason for
    this change is simple: Files have just gotten too big for floppies and their very
    limited 1.4MB capacity. The audio, video, and image files most people deal with
    these days are gigantic. You’d be lucky, for example, to fit more than three digital
    photos on one floppy disk. Compared to the other removable storage media popular
    today, such as CDs, Zip disks, memory cards, and the like, floppies are also too
    slow. You could practically feed the cat, make a cup of coffee, and read the first
    three pages of the newspaper in the time it takes to write a good number of files
    to a floppy. (Well, okay, that’s an exaggeration, but floppies are slow compared
    to the alternatives.)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite being small and slow, floppies are still used by a dwindling number
    of people who have no other way of transferring files to removable media, or who
    just want to hand over one or two small word-processing documents to another person
    who can read no other type of media. You may be one of these people, or you may
    have to send files to or receive them from someone in this situation.
  prefs: []

- en: Using floppies on your system is easy enough, though it is probably not as straightforward
    a task as you are familiar with, especially if you are a Mac emigrant. Let’s say
    you have a floppy that you made with your old system, and you want to copy the
    files on it to your new system. As you might imagine, you first need to put the
    floppy into the disk drive. So far, so good. In order to see what’s on the floppy,
    though, you have to *mount* the disk. To put it simply, mounting a disk is sort
    of like telling your system, “Hey, I’ve just stuck a disk in the drive, so wake
    up and deal with it.” If your system isn’t aware that your floppy is in there,
    it can’t very well show you what’s on it, right? While Fedora, like most operating
    systems these days, automatically mounts CDs, it does not extend the courtesy
    to floppies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The easiest way to mount the floppy is to right-click anywhere on your desktop,
    and then in the pop-up menu select **Disks** > **Floppy**. Fedora will then mount
    your floppy and place a small floppy disk icon on your desktop to let you know
    it’s done the job. Now double-click that icon, and a new Nautilus window will
    appear, displaying the contents of that disk.

    procedure that you used in your previous operating system, and as such, it requires
    no special explanation. However, things are a little different when it comes to
    writing to the floppy — when you drag a file to the Nautilus window with the list
    of your floppy disk’s contents, your system doesn’t actually write anything to
    the disk at that time. You can confirm this by looking at the activity light on
    your floppy disk drive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you first put your disk in the drive, you will see that the light stays
    off. Mount the drive by right-clicking the desktop and selecting **Disks** > **Floppy**,
    and the drive light comes on. Drag a file from the floppy to the trash, and the
    drive light will come on. Drag a file from the floppy to the desktop or your Home
    folder, and the light will come on. However, drag a file from your Home folder,
    or anywhere else on your hard disk, to the floppy, and the light will stay off.
    The file will appear in the floppy’s Nautilus window, but the drive light will
    not come on because the files have not yet been written to disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actual writing takes place when you are all done. Once you have dragged
    whatever it is that you want to copy to the floppy and are ready to eject it,
    you have to *unmount* the floppy first. To do this, close the floppy’s Nautilus
    window, right-click the desktop floppy disk’s icon, and in the pop-up menu, select
    **Eject**. At that time, the light on your floppy drive will come on as your system
    writes the files to disk. Once it is done, the floppy disk icon will disappear
    from your desktop and you can remove the disk from the drive. As you can see,
    this is a bit different, but not at all difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you have gone through the unmounting process I have just mentioned, you
    may sometimes still get a window telling you that the system cannot unmount your
    floppy disk, when in fact it has just done so or is in the process of doing so.
    You will know that this is the case if the floppy’s icon on the desktop disappears
    while you are in the midst of reading the no-can-do message. If you come across
    this scenario, it is all because your floppy is just too slow to keep up with
    the system. You can safely ignore the warning by clicking **OK**. If the floppy
    disk icon disappears, you know that it has been unmounted.

    can use as a staging area of sorts. Just copy the data from one removable source

    formatted. This is true of any kind of storage media, whether it be your hard
    disk, CDs, storage cards in your digital camera, or floppy disks, though it is
    sometimes done before you buy the media. By formatting a disk, your system (at
    your request) lays down a sort of map on the disk to specify where data can be
    stored. Because there are, and have been, many operating systems, there are many
    such formats. Linux can read both Linux-native *ext2*-formatted disks and Windows/
    DOS *FAT*-formatted disks. It can also create either format.

    in your CD drive, and a CD icon will automatically appear on the desktop. Double-
    clicking that icon will bring up a Nautilus window displaying the CD’s contents,
    and copying files from that window to your Home folder is a standard drag-and-
    drop procedure. Remember, as I mentioned in [Chapter 3](DDU0024_split_000.html#81),
    any file that you copy from CD to your hard disk will be write protected, as indicated
    by a red *verboten* symbol with a pencil through it. In order to be able to write
    to that file, you will have to change its permissions. These are accessible by
    right-clicking the file, selecting **Properties** in the pop-up window, and then

    you usually download them in the form of one or more disk images, which are commonly
    referred to as ISOs because such files end in the .iso extension. An *ISO* is
    an image of a CD’s file contents, which means that it is the CD minus the media
    itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the ISO would be the soul of

    be in the Write Tracks page of the Create CD window (see [Figure 7-8](#figure.DDU84)).
    Click the **Layout tracks** tab, and in the Image Information pane you will see
    a list of all of the ISOs that are present in your CD_stuff folder (or whatever
    other folder you specified during setup). Click the ISO that you want to copy
    to disk, and then click **Add**. The ISO you selected will then appear in the
    Tracks to Write pane, and you can click the **Accept Track Layout** button at
    the bottom of the page. Then click the **Write Tracks** tab.

    pane. If so, adjust the write speed in the **Speed** box so that it is less than
    the maximum write speed for your drive; I personally find it better to limit the
    speed to about 8 when creating Linux installation CDs, as CDs written at faster
    speeds sometimes create installation headaches.

    page, and you will be prompted to put a blank CD in your drive. Do that, and then
    click **OK**. The write process will then begin.

    will have to be a little patient. When it is all finished, X-CD-Roast will automatically
    eject your CD, and you can then close the remaining windows.
