- en: Toasters, ovens, and dishwashers are a few of the appliances found in our everyday
    lives. Though we are quite familiar with their use, few of us stop to think about
    how an appliance works under the hood, or even what makes an appliance, well,
    an appliance. This book defines an *appliance* as a device designed to primarily
    perform a single function. If you think about the appliances just mentioned, you’ll
    see that this definition holds true—toasters toast, ovens bake, and dishwashers
    wash dishes. Compared to a PC, which is capable of performing thousands of diverse
    functions depending on the hardware and software installed, traditional appliances
    are boring and simple.

- en: What does this have to do with Linux? For starters, traditional appliances are
    no longer so simple. What used to be electrified but still mechanical devices,
    such as a vacuum cleaners, are now not only electronic, but include processors,
    circuit boards, and sophisticated user interfaces. With these changes comes the
    need to run an operating system on the appliance to manage the new features. Linux
    is a natural fit for this because it is low cost (in most cases, it is free to
    use) and open source (which means you can modify it to better suit your needs).
    However, the real place where Linux fits in is with the new types of appliances
    that are being designed. Digital video recorders (DVRs) were unheard of just a
    few years ago, but the first and most popular DVR appliance, the TiVo, runs on
    Linux, as do many other home networking and entertainment appliances.

    to avoid designing it completely from scratch. You’d reuse as many parts as possible
    from your earlier robots, and you’d use off-the-shelf components wherever possible.
    The same *reuse* mentality applies to Linux appliances, and that’s where this
    book can help.

    appliance that you can use as the basis for your appliance, if you wish. We divide
    an appliance into daemons and user interfaces and show how to create and manage
    daemons, as well as how to build five different types of user interfaces.

    and support multiple user interfaces, build secure daemons, or provide logging
    and event management. The book may also be of value to any developer who wants
    to minimize the effort needed to port a daemon’s user interface to different operating
    systems or a different programming language. Our only major assumption is that
    the reader is comfortable programming in C on the Linux platform.

- en: Linux appliance programmers can typically use their desktop machines for most
    software development because appliance user interfaces and services seldom need
    to be developed on the target hardware. Therefore, software development can proceed
    in parallel, with one team developing embedded Linux for the appliance and another
    team developing the main application and user interfaces.
