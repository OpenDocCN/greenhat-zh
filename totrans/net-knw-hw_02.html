Without these rules, the people using the network cannot be sure that their computers will communicate successfully.</p><p>For example, the plugs at the ends of data cables must match the sockets on each computer and other network hardware. If a cable uses a square plug with two pins, but the computer has a round socket with four holes, they won't fit together. The same thing applies to the electrical voltages, timing, error checking, and other issues. There are many different kinds of networks, each with its own rules. This chapter explains a few general principles about networks and describes the network types that you're most likely to see in a home or small office network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0077"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0078"/></p><p>You can use a network without understanding all the internal details of network communications, but if you're designing and building a new network, you should know how to choose the best options for your particular requirements. You can treat individual network components as a series of black boxes, but you still have to know <span class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> black boxes to use. And when something goes wrong, knowing what's inside those boxes will make troubleshooting a lot easier.</p><p>Before we talk about specific network types, let's look at the common elements of every computer network.</p><p>As you probably know, computers reduce all information to only two information states: Either a signal is present, or there is no signal. These two conditions are usually described as 1 and 0, or on and off, or mark and space. Each instance of a 1 or a 0 is a "bit." Anything described as "digital" can be reduced to those ones and zeroes.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0079"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0080"/></p><p>The form that each 1 or 0 takes is different in different types of communication channels. It could be a light, sound, or electrical charge that is either on or off; a series of long and short sounds or light flashes; or two different audio tones, electrical voltages, or radio frequencies. In a very simple system, the 1 might correspond to "yes" and the 0 to "no," or any other pair of options.</p><p>Individual bits only offer two options, so they're not particularly useful, but when you string eight of them together (into a <span class="emphasis"><em>byte</em></span>), you can have 256 different combinations (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2). That's enough to assign a different sequence to every letter of the alphabet (both upper- and lowercase), the ten digits from 0 to 9, spaces between words, and other symbols such as punctuation marks and many letters used in foreign alphabets. A byte is the basic building block of computer communication. The most widely used coding system for converting bytes to characters is called <span class="emphasis"><em>ASCII</em></span> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#these_bits_form_the_ascii_sequence_of_a" title="Figure 2-1. These bits form the ASCII sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110).">Figure 2-1</a> shows a typical sequence of two bytes.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0081"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0082"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="these_bits_form_the_ascii_sequence_of_a"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e773"/><img alt="These bits form the ASCII sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110)." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266194.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-1. These bits form the ASCII sequence of <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> (<code class="literal">01000001</code>) and <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> (<code class="literal">01101110</code>).</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>ASCII is fine for text, but a computer can also convert many other forms of information to digital data. For example, it can divide every second of sound from a microphone or an analog recording into thousands of very short segments and use 16 or 24 bits to specify the content of each segment, or divide a picture into millions of individual points (called <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span>, short for <span class="emphasis"><em>picture elements</em></span>) and use a series of bits to specify the color of each bit.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0083"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0084"/></p><p>A wire or other data link can carry only one bit at a time. Either there's a signal on the line or there isn't. Over short distances, it's possible to send the data through a cable that carries eight (or some multiple of eight) signals in <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel</em></span> through eight separate wires. Obviously, a parallel connection can be eight times faster than sending one bit at a time through a single wire, but those eight wires cost eight times as much as a single wire. That added cost is insignificant when the wires extend only a foot or two, but the additional cost of parallel wires can add up quickly when you're trying to send the data over a long distance. And when you're using existing circuits such as telephone lines, you don't have any choice; you must find a way to send one bit at a time, with some additional bits and pauses that identify the beginning of each new byte. This is a <span class="emphasis"><em>serial</em></span> data communications channel, because you're sending the bits one after another. At this stage, it doesn't matter what medium you use to transmit those bits—it could be electrical impulses on a wire, or two different audio tones, or a series of flashing lights, or even a lot of notes attached to the legs of carrier pigeons—but you must have a way to convert the text or other output of the computer to the signals used by the transmission medium, and to convert the same signals back again at the other end.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="packets_and_headers"/>Packets and Headers</h1></div></div></div><p>Communication over a direct physical connection (such as a wire) between a single origin and destination doesn't need any kind of address or routing information to tell a message where to go. You might have to set up the connection first (by placing a telephone call or plugging cables into a switchboard), but after you're connected, the link remains in place until you instruct the system to disconnect. This kind of connection is great for voice and for simple data links, but it's not particularly efficient for digital data on a complex network that serves many origins and destinations, because a single connection ties up the circuit all the time, even when no data is moving through the channel.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0085"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0086"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0087"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0088"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0089"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0090"/></p><p>The alternative is to send your message to a switching center that will hold it until a link to the destination becomes available. This is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>store and forward</em></span> system. If the network has been properly designed for the type of data and the amount of traffic in the system, the waiting time will be insignificant. If the communications network covers a lot of territory, you can forward the message to one or more intermediate switching centers before it reaches the ultimate destination.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0091"/></p><p>To make the network even more efficient, you can divide messages that are longer than some arbitrary limit into separate pieces, called <span class="emphasis"><em>packets</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>frames</em></span>. Packets from more than one message can alternate with packets containing other messages as they travel between switching centers, and reassemble themselves into the original messages at the destination.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0092"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0093"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0094"/></p><p>The great advantage of this approach is that many messages can share the same circuits on an as-available basis. The packets from a single message might alternate with packets from one or more other messages as they move through parts of the network. For example, if you send a message to a recipient in another city, the packets usually move through an inter-city channel along with many other messages.</p><p>Each data packet must also contain yet another set of information: the address of the packet's destination, the sequence order of this packet relative to other packets in the original transmission, and so forth. Some of this information provides additional error checking and instructs the switching centers where to forward each packet, while other information tells the destination device how to reassemble the data in the packet back into the original message.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>headers</em></span> (at the beginning of a packet) and <span class="emphasis"><em>trailers</em></span> (at the end of a packet) attached to each packet include the address of the packet's destination, information that allows the recipient to confirm that the packet's content is accurate, and information that the recipient uses to reassemble the packets in the original order. Between the origin and the destination, network routing equipment sometimes adds more headers or trailers that contain routing instructions and other administrative information.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0095"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0096"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0097"/></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch02.html#a_data_packet_may_be_surrounded_by_seve" title="Figure 2-2. A data packet may be surrounded by several kinds of headers and footers.">Figure 2-2</a> shows how a network adds and removes headers and trailers at different stages of a communication session. The specific names of the headers and trailer don't matter right now; the point is that they surround the original data packet.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_data_packet_may_be_surrounded_by_seve"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e880"/><img alt="A data packet may be surrounded by several kinds of headers and footers." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266196.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-2. A data packet may be surrounded by several kinds of headers and footers.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>That same pattern repeats every time you add another layer of activity to a communications system. Each layer may attach additional information to the original message and strip off that information after it has done whatever the added information instructed it to do. By the time a message travels from a laptop computer on a wireless network through an office network and a gateway to the Internet, and onward to a distant computer connected to another local network, a dozen or more information attachments might be added and removed before the recipient reads the original text. A package of data that includes address and control information ahead of the bits that contain the content of the message, followed by an error-checking sequence, is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>frame</em></span>. Both wired and wireless networks divide the data stream into frames that contain various forms of handshaking information along with the original data.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0098"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The network deals with packets and frames at different places during the process of transmitting data. Fortunately, this all happens automatically, so you (as a network user) don't have to worry about adding or removing them by hand.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="error_checking"/>Error Checking</h2></div></div></div><p>In a perfect transmission channel, the signal that goes in at one end would be absolutely identical to the one that comes out at the other end. But in the real world, there's almost always some kind of noise along the line that can interfere with the original signal. <span class="emphasis"><em>Noise</em></span> is defined as anything that interrupts or is added to the original signal; it could be caused by a lightning strike, interference from another communications channel, devices not working correctly, or dirt on an electrical contact someplace in the circuit (or in the case of carrier pigeons, an attack by a marauding hawk). Whatever the source, noise in the channel can interrupt the flow of data. In a modern communications system, those bits are pouring through the circuit extremely quickly—millions of them every second—so a noise hit for even a fraction of a second can obliterate enough bits to turn your data into digital gibberish.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0099"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0100"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0101"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0102"/></p><p>Therefore, your data stream must include a process called <span class="emphasis"><em>error checking</em></span>. Error checking is accomplished by adding some kind of standard information to each byte. In a simple computer data network, the handshaking information is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>parity bit</em></span>, which tells the device receiving each byte whether the sum of the ones and zeroes inside the byte is odd or even. This value is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>checksum</em></span>. If the receiving device discovers that the parity bit is not correct, it instructs the transmitter to send the same byte again. More complex networks, including wireless systems, include additional error-checking handshaking data with each string of data.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0103"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0104"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="handshaking_and_overhead"/>Handshaking and Overhead</h2></div></div></div><p>The computer that originates a message or a stream of data can't just jump online and start sending bytes. First it has to warn the device at the other end that it is ready to send and make sure the intended recipient is ready to accept data. To accomplish this, a series of "handshaking" requests and answers must surround the actual data.</p><p>The sequence of requests goes something like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Origin: "Hey destination! I have some data for you."</p><p>Destination: "Okay, origin, go ahead. I'm ready."</p><p>Origin: "Here comes the data."</p><p>Origin: Data data data data . . . checksum</p><p>Origin: "That's the message. Did you get it?"</p><p>Destination: "I got something, but it appears to be damaged."</p><p>Origin: "Here it is again."</p><p>Origin: Data data data data . . . checksum</p><p>Origin: "Did you get it that time?"</p><p>Destination: "Yup, I got it. I'm ready for more data."</p></blockquote></div><p>We can leave the specific form of handshaking information to the network designers and engineers, but it's important to understand that not every bit that moves through a computer data network is part of the original block of information that arrived at the input computer. In a complex network such as a wireless data channel, as much as 40 percent or more of the transmitted data is handshaking and other overhead. It's all essential, but every one of those bits increases the amount of time that the message needs to move through the network.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ethernet"/>Ethernet</h1></div></div></div><p>Ethernet was introduced in the 1970s as a method for connecting multiple computers and related equipment in the same building. Ethernet offers several advantages: It's fast, it's extremely flexible, it's relatively easy to install and use, and it's inexpensive. It has become an industry standard supported by dozens of manufacturers, so you can use different brands of equipment in the same network. Today, more than 85 percent of all local area networks (LANs), including just about every modern home and office network, use some form of Ethernet to provide the physical connection between computers through twisted-pair cables, coaxial cables, or fiber optic cables.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0107"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0108"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0109"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0110"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0111"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0112"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0113"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0114"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0115"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0116"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0117"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0105"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0106"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0118"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0119"/></p><p>One of Ethernet's most important features is the method it uses to prevent conflicts among nodes, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)</em></span>. Every time a network node is ready to transmit a frame, it checks if another frame is already using the network; if the network is clear, the node sends the frame. But if the node detects that another frame is using the network (a condition called a <span class="emphasis"><em>collision</em></span>), it waits a random period of time before it tries again. CSMA/CD is important because it allows a relatively large number of computers and other devices to operate through the same network without interference.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0120"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0121"/></p><p>There are many Ethernet specifications that cover different data transfer speeds and different kinds of cables and connectors. The ones you're most likely to see in a small LAN include the following:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0122"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0123"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>10Base-T: 10 Mbps through twisted-pair cables</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>100Base-T or Fast Ethernet: 100 Mbps through twisted-pair cables</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1000Base-T or Gigabit Ethernet: 1000 Mbps through twisted-pair or fiber optic cables</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Wireless or Wi-Fi: any of several systems that use radio signals instead of wires—the latest 802.11n Wi-Fi networks can operate at speeds up to 70 Mbps.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0124"/></p></li></ul></div><p>A 10Base-T network is adequate for a small home network. It's faster than most broadband Internet services, so it's sufficient for handling the inbound and outbound data (including audio and video) that you exchange with the Internet. However, most new network ports, hubs, and switches can handle both 10Base-T and 100Base-T, so there's very little point to limiting the network to the slower speed. 100Base-T will also allow you to move pictures, music, and videos and play multiplayer games within your own network much faster than a 10Base-T network, and it will not limit the speed of an 802.11n link. Considering the insignificant difference in cost, today's 100Base-T networks are always a better choice than the older 10Base-T versions.</p><p>If a 100Base-T network can't handle 100 Mbps because of interference or some other problem, it will automatically drop down to 10Base-T. A 10Base-T device can work on a 100Base-T network, but it will force the whole network to drop down to 10 Mbps.</p><p>A Gigabit Ethernet network is lightning fast (by today's standards), but it's also more expensive than a network that uses slower equipment. It might be appropriate for a business that moves very high volumes of data through its LAN. As the cost of Gigabit Ethernet drops, it will become the preferred choice for home and small business networks.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0125"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0126"/></p><p>You might also see the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Ethernet</em></span> used to identify the connector on a computer, printer, or other network device that mates with an Ethernet cable to connect the device to a network. The instruction manual or the label on every piece of Ethernet-compatible equipment should tell you which type of connection it uses.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Twisted-pair</em></span> cables are bundles of wires in which each pair of wires is twisted together, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#a_typical_ethernet_cable_contains_four" title="Figure 2-3. A typical Ethernet cable contains four twisted pairs of color-coded wires.">Figure 2-3</a>. Because data normally moves in only one direction through each pair of wires, a 10Base-T or 100Base-T network connection uses two pairs—one for each direction. The most common Ethernet cables include a total of eight wires in four color-coded wire pairs, so you can use the remaining wires as spares.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0127"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_typical_ethernet_cable_contains_four"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1112"/><img alt="A typical Ethernet cable contains four twisted pairs of color-coded wires." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266198.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-3. A typical Ethernet cable contains four twisted pairs of color-coded wires.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Most of the remaining chapters of this book are dedicated to features and functions of Ethernet networks.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="dealing_with_other_open_par"/><p class="title"><b>DEALING WITH OTHER (MOSTLY OBSOLETE) WIRED NETWORKS</b></p><p>Ethernet is by far the most widely used type of LAN connection, but if you're using older equipment you might occasionally find a computer or other device that uses some other type of network structure. Many of those older networks require special equipment and experienced network technicians, but the rest of us don't have to run away from them.</p><p>If you have inherited a working network, the best thing you can do is to leave it alone. It has probably been working without any problems for many years, and you can expect it to continue to do so unless you try to expand or otherwise "improve" it. This is a classic example of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</p><p>On the other hand, if you have an old desktop computer with some other kind of network interface, or no network adapter at all, you can probably connect it to your Ethernet LAN if you don't mind opening up the computer and swapping circuit cards. Look for an Ethernet network interface adapter on a plug-in card that fits one of the empty expansion slots, and download the latest driver software from the card manufacturer's website.</p></div></div>

Another name for Wi-Fi is <span class="emphasis"><em>wireless Ethernet</em></span>, because Wi-Fi uses many of the same data-handling rules and specifications as a wired Ethernet network. However, every Wi-Fi packet must include additional handshaking data, so the overall data transfer speed is often slower than a conventional Ethernet link.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0129"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0130"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0131"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0132"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0133"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0134"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0135"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0136"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0128"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0137"/></p><p>Wi-Fi offers several advantages: It doesn't need cables to connect every network node, so it's often easier to install and use than a wired network connection. Rather than string cables through walls and provide a network outlet at every desk, you can distribute access to the network through antennas in between each computer and a base station (an <span class="emphasis"><em>access point</em></span>) in a central location. When you travel with a laptop computer, a handheld PDA (personal digital assistant), or a mobile Internet device, such as a BlackBerry or an iPhone, you can often connect it to the Internet via Wi-Fi by simply turning it on.</p><p>Many home and small business networks use a combination of Ethernet and Wi-Fi; the Wi-Fi base station doubles as a connection point for Ethernet cables, so the same LAN includes both wired and wireless nodes. <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. WI-FI NETWORKS">Chapter 8</a> contains information about installing and using Wi-Fi network links.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0138"/></p></div>

If you're clear on these two types of network devices, you will avoid a lot of headaches caused by communication failures.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0157"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0158"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0159"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0160"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0161"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0162"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0163"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0164"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0165"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0166"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0167"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0168"/></p><p>Data can move through a wire in only one direction. When a data link sends and receives signals at the same time, it must use separate wires to send data from the DTE to the DCE, and from the DCE to the DTE. Therefore, a network device uses separate inputs and outputs on the same multipin connector. The specific pin assignment is different in different connection types, but the inputs and outputs are always different pins or sockets.</p><p>The problem arises because every output must connect to an input. As <a class="xref" href="ch02s06.html#connect_an_output_to_an_output_or_an_in" title="Figure 2-5. Connect an output to an output or an input to an input and nothing useful happens.">Figure 2-5</a> shows, if you connect an output to another output, the two signals will collide; if you connect an input to an input, there's never any signal.</p><div class="figure"><a id="connect_an_output_to_an_output_or_an_in"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1394"/><img alt="Connect an output to an output or an input to an input and nothing useful happens." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266202.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-5. Connect an output to an output or an input to an input and nothing useful happens.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Therefore, when you connect two pieces of equipment, the outputs at each end must go to inputs at the other end. If Pin 2 on one device is an output, Pin 2 on the other device must be an input. Most standard data cables connect each connector pin to the same numbered pin at the other end, so connecting two devices through a cable is exactly the same as plugging one device directly into another.</p><p>That's why there are two categories of data devices. Data terminal equipment includes remote terminals, computers, some printers, and other network endpoints. Data communications equipment includes modems, hubs, switches, and other control devices. When you connect a terminal to a control device, the output pins on the DTE device connect to the input pins on the DCE device.</p><p>The problem arises when you want to connect two computers without a control device in between. Direct computer-to-computer communication requires a special cable because you can't connect a DTE device directly to another DTE device. When you connect two DTE devices with serial data ports, you connect the output on one computer to the output on the other computer, and the input to the input, so neither computer will actually receive any data. Therefore, you must flip the connections, so each output connects to an input.

For example, as <a class="xref" href="ch02s10.html#a_printer_server_can_be_either_a_comput" title="Figure 2-12. A printer server can be either a computer with a printer connected to it or a dedicated printer server.">Figure 2-12</a> shows, a printer server could be a computer with a printer attached to it, or a printer with an internal or external network adapter connected directly to the network.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_printer_server_can_be_either_a_comput"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e2098"/><img alt="A printer server can be either a computer with a printer connected to it or a dedicated printer server." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266216.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 2-12. A printer server can be either a computer with a printer connected to it or a dedicated printer server.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e2105"/><img alt="A printer server can be either a computer with a printer connected to it or a dedicated printer server." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266218.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>In a small network, it's not unusual for the same computer to double as a client and a server. For example, in a home network, the family's printer might be located in the kitchen, where Mom has a computer on which she keeps the family's financial records and looks up recipes on the Internet. The kitchen computer is the network's printer server. When others in the house want to print something, they instruct their own computer to send it to the printer through the network to the computer in the kitchen. The computers' operating systems know how to handle such print requests without interrupting other programs running on the printer server.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0261"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0262"/></p><p>Clients and servers are important because they are essential network building blocks. A client-and-server structure is often the very best way to add services to a network because it's an efficient way to share expensive hardware and software, and it makes those services equally accessible to everybody.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0263"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0264"/></p><p>For more details about adding and using servers, see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. FILE SERVERS">Chapter 9</a>.</p></div></body></html>
