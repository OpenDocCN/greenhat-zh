- en: Every computer on a network uses some kind of internal or external connector
    to send and receive data to and from other computers. This connector, along with
    the hardware that controls it, is called a *network adapter* or *network interface*
    because it's the point of contact between the computer and the network. In a small
    home or business network, the network interface can be either an Ethernet port
    that communicates with the network through a cable or a wireless transmitter and
    receiver that exchanges radio signals with a Wi-Fi base station. This chapter
    describes the most common wired Ethernet network interfaces. [Chapter 8](ch08.html
    "Chapter 8. WI-FI NETWORKS") provides similar information about connecting your
    computer to a network through a wireless interface.

- en: Every modern wired Ethernet interface has an eight-pin socket (an *Ethernet
    port* or *jack*) that mates with the plug on an Ethernet cable. Both the plug
    and the socket follow a standard called *RJ-45* that specifies the size and shape
    of the connectors and the signals that move through each of the eight pins (*RJ*
    stands for *Registered Jack*). RJ-45 connectors are similar to the six-pin RJ-11
    plugs and sockets used on telephones, but the RJ-45 is slightly larger to allow
    for the additional pins. [Figure 7-1](ch07.html#an_rj-45_data_plug_open_parenthesis

    operating system.

    to turn off that interface and use a network adapter on an expansion card or some
    other kind of external network interface. This might happen when you want to use
    a faster network than your built-in adapter can handle (such as a Gigabit Ethernet
    network) or if the onboard network controller doesn't work correctly.

    when you turn on the computer. These settings are an essential part of the computer's
    startup sequence because they tell the computer where and how to find the operating
    system. To run the BIOS settings utility, turn off the computer, then turn it
    on again and immediately press the **del** (delete) or F1 key (depending on the
    type of BIOS your computer uses).

    the computer but the rest of the network is okay and all the network cables are
    plugged into their appropriate sockets, it's possible that the internal adapter
    has been disabled by accident. This should never happen unless somebody goes into
    the BIOS utility and changes the setting, but it's possible, especially if the
    computer is in a public location where other people can mess with it.

    it won't come close to the performance of today's least expensive models. Considering

    new computer, it's time to replace your "Old Faithful" antique instead.

    For example, when the LINK indicator lights, you know that the computer is connected

    is turned off. This happens when the computer's BIOS has a "wake on LAN" feature
    that turns on the computer if the adapter receives an incoming signal. Even if
    this feature is disabled, the computer keeps the network port alive whenever the
    power supply is turned on. The only way to disable the network adapter completely
    is to either unplug the AC power or turn off the power switch on the back of the
    power supply.
