- en: Wireless Ethernet, better known as Wi-Fi, uses spread-spectrum radio signaling
    to distribute computer data through local area networks. This chapter describes
    the technical details of Wi-Fi networking, including the differences among the
    Wi-Fi standards and the structure of a network. It also includes basic information
    about Wi-Fi access points (also called *base stations*) and network interface
    adapters.

- en: In an 802.11 network, the radio transmitter adds a 144-bit preamble to each
    packet, with 128 bits that the receiver uses to synchronize with the transmitter
    and a 16-bit start-of-frame field (a *frame* is a packet with additional data
    added to the beginning or end of the bit string). This is followed by a 48-bit
    header that contains information about the data transfer speed, the length of
    the data contained in the packet, and an error-checking sequence. This header
    is called the PHY preamble because it controls the physical layer (in the ISO
    model) of the communication link.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the header specifies the speed of the data that follows it, the preamble
    and the header are always transmitted at 1Mbps. Therefore, even if a network link
    is operating at the full 11Mbps, the effective data transfer speed is considerably
    slower. In practice, the best you can expect is about 85 percent of the nominal
    speed, and the other types of overhead in the data packets reduce the actual speed
    even more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 144-bit preamble is a holdover from the older and slower DSSS systems that
    has stayed in the specification to assure that 802.11 devices are still compatible
    with the older standards, but it really doesn't accomplish anything useful. There
    is an optional alternative that uses a shorter 72-bit preamble. In a short preamble,
    the synchronization field has 56 bits that are combined with the same 16-bit start-of-frame
    field used in long preambles. The 72-bit preamble is not compatible with very
    old 802.11 hardware, but that doesn't matter in a modern Wi-Fi network because
    all the nodes can recognize the short preamble format. In all other respects,
    a short preamble works just as well as a long one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It takes the network a maximum of 192 milliseconds to handle a long preamble,
    compared to 96 milliseconds for a short preamble. In other words, the short preamble
    cuts the overhead on each packet in half. This makes a significant difference
    in the actual data transmission speed, especially for things like streaming audio
    and video and voice over Internet services.
  prefs: []

    short preamble. It's usually possible to change the preamble length in the configuration

    don''t have to understand as long as it''s the same for all the devices in the
    network. Fifteen years ago, when telephone modems were the most common way to
    connect one computer to another, we all had to worry about setting the data bits
    and stop bits every time we placed a call through a modem. You probably never
    knew exactly what a stop bit is (it''s the amount of time an old mechanical Teletype
    printer needed to return to the idle state after sending or receiving each byte),
    but you knew that it had to be the same at both ends. Preamble length is the same
    kind of obscure setting: It has to be the same on every node in a network, but
    most people neither know nor care what it means.'

    of the data link layer) controls the traffic that moves through the radio network.
    It prevents data collisions and conflicts by using a set of rules called *carrier
    sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)*, and it supports the security
    functions specified in the 802.11 standards. When the network includes more than
    one access point, the MAC layer associates each network client with the access
    point that provides the best signal quality.

    CSMA/CA instructs all but one of the conflicting nodes to back off and try again
    later, and it allows the surviving node to send its packet. CSMA/CA works like
    this: When a network node is ready to send a packet, it listens for other signals
    first. If it doesn''t hear anything, it waits for a random (but short) period
    of time and then listens again. If it still doesn''t sense a signal, it transmits
    a packet. The device that receives the packet evaluates it, and if it''s intact,
    the receiving mode returns an acknowledgment. But if the sending node does not
    receive the acknowledgment, it assumes that there has been a collision with another
    packet that scrambled the data, so it waits for another random interval and then
    tries again.'

    center frequency of a 22 MHz channel. Therefore, each channel overlaps with several
    other channels that are above and below it. The whole 2.4 GHz band only has space
    for three completely separate channels, so if your network runs on channel 4,
    for example, and your neighbor is using channel 5 or channel 6, each network will
    detect the other network's signals as interference. Both networks will work, but
    the performance (as reflected in the data transfer speed) will not be as good
    as it would be when the channels are more widely separated from one another.

    usage with other nearby network managers (your neighbors running their own home
    Wi-Fi networks count as network managers). If possible, each network should use
    channels that are at least 25 MHz or five channel numbers apart. If you're trying
    to eliminate interference between two networks, use one high channel number and
    one low number. For three channels, your best choices are channels 1, 6, and 11,
    as shown in [Figure 3-1](ch03s03.html#channels_1_6_and_11_do_not_interfere_wit

    you can optimize the performance of your network by staying away from a channel
    that somebody else is using nearby, but even if you and your neighbor are on adjacent
    channels, your networks will probably work, although your connections might be
    a bit slower than they'd be on more widely separated channels. Unless your neighbor's
    network is extremely busy, you're likely to have more problems with interference

    for that adapter is available. In practice, that means you can find Windows drivers
    for just about everything, but you will have fewer choices if you're using a computer
    running Mac OS, Linux, or Unix. You can find pointers to sources for Linux and
    Unix drivers in [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. WI-FI FOR LINUX AND UNIX"),
    and information about using Wi-Fi with a Macintosh in [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. WI-FI

    in different places. For example, when your laptop is running in your office,
    you will want it to connect to your LAN through a Wi-Fi link so you can use the
    company's high-speed Internet account and exchange files and messages with other
    local computers. But when you take the same computer on the road, you want to
    connect to the Internet through a cellular data service. Therefore, it would be
    very convenient if your computer could automatically choose the best connection
    for your current location.

    that controls each type of network; you might also have to physically remove one
    network adapter and insert another one. But the makers of laptop computers and
    network interface adapters are working on this problem, and several of them will
    offer a single network adapter and control software in the near future that detects
    more than one type of wireless service and either offers an onscreen choice or
    automatically selects the best connection for you.

    cellular data account.

    Some look like industrial devices that were intended to be placed out of sight
    on the floor or mounted on an inconspicuous wall, but others (especially the ones
    targeted at the home network market) have swooshy, "aerodynamic" shapes that appear
    to have been designed for the top of a coffee table or, more likely, next to a
    desktop computer. Some have internal antennas, others (like the one in [Figure 3-2](ch03s04.html#a_typical_wi-fi_access_point_this_one_fr
    "Figure 3-2. A typical Wi-Fi access point, this one from Linksys")) have short
    vertical whips permanently attached, and still others have connectors for external
    antennas (which may or may not be supplied with the access point). Regardless
    of its size and shape, every access point includes a radio that sends and receives
    messages and data between network stations and an Ethernet port that connects
    to a wired network.

    As the name suggests, an ad hoc network is usually temporary. An *ad hoc network*
    is a self-contained group of stations with no connection to a larger LAN or the
    Internet. It includes two or more wireless stations with no access point or connection
    to the rest of the world. Ad hoc networks are also called *peer-to-peer networks*
    and *independent basic service sets (IBSS)*. [Figure 3-3](ch03s04.html#an_ad_hoc_wireless_network_with_three_st

    connected to a wired network. Each wireless station exchanges messages and data
    with the access point, which relays them to other nodes on the wireless network
    or the wired LAN. Any network that requires a wired connection through an access
    point to a printer, a fileserver, or an Internet gateway is an infrastructure
    network. [Figure 3-4](ch03s04.html#a_simple_infrastructure_network "Figure 3-4. A

- en: An infrastructure network with just one base station is also called a *basic
    service set (BSS)*. When the wireless network uses two or more access points,
    the network structure is an *extended service set (ESS)*. Recall that the technical
    name for a network ID is the *SSID*. You might also see it called a *BSSID* if
    the network has just one access point or an *ESSID* when it has two or more access
    points.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A network with more than one access point (an ESS) creates several new complications.
    First, the network must include a way for only one base station to handle data
    from a particular station, even if the station is within range of more than one
    base station. And if the station is moving during a network session, or if some
    kind of local interference crops up near the first access point, the network might
    have to hand off the connection from one access point to another. Wi-Fi networks
    handle this problem by associating a station with only one access point at a time
    and ignoring the signals from stations that are not associated. When the signal
    fades at one access point and improves at another, or when the amount of traffic
    forces the network to rebalance the load, the network will reassociate the station
    with a new access point that can provide acceptable service. If you think this
    sounds a lot like the way a cellular telephone system handles roaming, you're
    absolutely correct; even the terminology is the same—it's also called *roaming*.

    a base station (licensed radio services typically require an expensive license
    to operate a radio at a specific location for a fixed number of years). Some of
    these base stations limit access to a specific set of users, but others allow
    any computer within range of the radio signal to set up a connection.

    more than one active network; some of them might be private networks, and others
    might be accessible to anybody who wants to use them. Public access points, also
    called *hot spots*, allow any nearby computer to establish a connection; some
    require paid accounts, but many others, especially in places like schools and
    libraries, are free (although they might require a login name and password).

    such as encryption or MAC address restriction that locks out unauthorized users,
    but it's not uncommon to find home and business networks that are wide open because
    the owner never bothered to turn on the security tools. We'll explain how to use
    MAC address restriction and other security tools in [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. WIRELESS
    NETWORK SECURITY").

    essential elements that form the internal plumbing of a Wi-Fi network. Like the
    components of most other networks (and most plumbing systems, for that matter),
    these elements should be entirely invisible to the people using the network—if
    users can send and receive messages, read files, and perform other activities
    on the network, they should never have to worry about the low-level details.

    your wireless LAN moves messages from here to there than 95 percent of the people
    who use Wi-Fi networks. And you have a good chance of understanding the support
    person who tells you to make sure you're using channel 11, or that you need to
