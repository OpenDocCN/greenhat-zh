- en: OpenVPN is an open source VPN implementation that uses the OpenSSL library to
    encrypt data traveling over a public network. A VPN (virtual private network)
    is a private connection from one point to another that utilizes an existing network
    as a transport medium. VPNs are popular with businesses because they allow secure
    communication between sites or employees without the need to lease dedicated WAN
    (wide area network) lines.

- en: James Yonan began developing OpenVPN in early 2002\. Yonan's employer at the
    time afforded him the freedom to telecommute. As a result, he became interested
    in telecommunication tools. His examination of the open source VPN community revealed
    a divide between security-conscious and usability-based software projects. Yonan's
    OpenVPN has grown into a very popular and complete VPN solution that addresses
    both security and usability issues. Yonan continues development of OpenVPN as
    project leader.

    security and functionality.

    is considered insecure due to a publicly known security exploit.

    reasonably secure VPN solution. However, it has problems traversing many basic
    NAT routers.

- en: OpenVPN is a cross-platform VPN solution that has proven to be secure, sustainable
    across NAT routers, and scalable. OpenVPN does require client software installation
    to function and can be complicated to set up initially.

- en: OpenVPN supports routed or bridged VPNs. A routed VPN creates a virtual subnet
    for the client and routes traffic over the VPN if addressed to a system on the
    remote side. A bridged VPN connects clients to an existing network subnet. Data
    is broadcast through the bridge like a virtual Ethernet hub. A bridged VPN tunnel
    can provide a client with the same network functionality as being connected locally
    to that network. This guide outlines the setup of a bridged VPN rather than the
    default routed method.

- en: A bridged VPN joins remote clients to a local network as if they were onsite,
    with all of the benefits of being on that local network. Also, bridged VPNs can
    use non-routable protocols (required by Windows file shares, broadcast traffic,
    LAN games, and so on) that small office and home office users may find useful.
