    camera matters more than the camera. The same applies to making great
    audio recordings—the person behind the gear matters more than the gear.
    This doesn’t mean that the gear doesn’t matter, because it does. But
    merely owning the most expensive, elite audio equipment won’t turn you
    into Tom Dowd or Rick Rubin or Quincy Jones or George Martin or whoever
    your favorite legendary music producer is. It won’t turn average musicians
    into stars.</p><p>When you’re shopping for audio gear and getting drawn into the
    “higher specs and price tags is better!” zone, take a step back and reboot
    your mind. Take a deep breath, slow down, and concentrate on learning how
    to get the best out of lower-end equipment. Because today’s average
    digital audio gear is better than the top-of-the-line analog studio gear
    of yesteryear, with more accuracy, fidelity, wider dynamic range, and less
    noise, it’s a whole lot easier to record, mix, edit, and apply special
    effects. You won’t have to fuss so much with learning how to use your
    equipment, and you can concentrate more on learning how to make good
    recordings with artistic and technical fidelity. Then if you find yourself
    yearning for a better preamp, better microphones, better speakers, or
    what-have-you, you’ll have good reasons, and you’ll know and appreciate
    better quality when you find it.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In this chapter we’re going to turn a PC into a digital audio
    workstation, and we won’t break the bank to do it. We’ll also look at
    portable digital recorders, which cram amazing fidelity and storage
    capacity into tiny devices and are endlessly useful in all kinds of
    circumstances.</p><div class="sect1" title="Getting Sound In and Out of the Computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="getting_sound_in_and_out_of_the_computer"/>Getting Sound In and Out of the Computer</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the biggest hurdles with PC-based audio production is
      figuring out audio gear. There is a huge and bewildering selection of
      audio components with every imaginable combination of features and price
      tags. In this chapter I’ll discuss the basic elements of a small
      recording studio. <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Audio Hardware">Appendix A</a> goes into more
      detail on hardware, with examples of different models and brands in
      different price ranges.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are several ways to interface audio gear with a computer: a
      PCI or PCI-E sound card for a desktop computer; a Cardbus or ExpressCard
      sound card for laptops; USB 1.1, USB 2.0, or FireWire audio interface
      for any computer. You will need one of these. Which one? For one- or
      two-track recording, any of them will do. For heavy-duty multitrack
      recording, USB 1.1 is not a candidate. But it’s great for one- and
      two-track recording, and you’ll have a lot of excellent, moderately
      priced devices to choose from. For serious multi-track recording, you
      need the faster protocols, especially if you’re going to record at high
      bit depths and sampling rates, so we’ll look at their strengths and
      weaknesses.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The most essential component in digital audio production is the
      analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter. The ADC/DAC is how you
      get analog audio in and out of your computer. It takes the analog signal
      from a microphone or instrument and converts it to a digital signal.
      Then it converts a digital signal to analog for playback. ADC/DACs come
      in a multitude of forms: The most low-end, cheapskate onboard sound chip
      has one, and of course so do higher-end audio interfaces. There are all
      kinds of USB and FireWire recording interfaces that connect microphones
      and instruments to your computer, and with them you don’t need to bother
      with an internal sound card at all. There are also slick little portable
      ADC/DACs for connecting turntables, cassette recorders, and stereo hi-fi
      amplifiers to a computer, as well as USB microphones and turntables with
      built-in USB ADC/DACs. And for the studio geek with a healthy budget,
      there are the more expensive rack-mount ADC/DACs.</p><div class="sect2" title="An Example Studio"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="an_example_studio"/>An Example Studio</h2></div></div></div><p>Let’s start off with a photo of a basic, moderate-quality

        MobilePre USB preamp/analog-to-digital converter. In front are two
        dynamic microphones. Not shown are a pair of nice JBL speakers mounted
        up on the wall. You can cram a lot of functionality into a small

            speakers</p></li></ul></div><p>The turntable plugs into the phono ports on the amp. The amp
        connects to the MobilePre from a pair of recording outputs. I could
        use an RCA-pair-to-two-1/4″ TRS adapter or an
        RCA-pair-to-stereo-mini-plug, because the MobilePre is flexible when
        it comes to making connections.</p><p>You can digitize any legacy media with this kind of setup,
        because whatever connects to your hi-fi amp or receiver can be copied
        into your computer.</p><p>Both recording and playback are routed through the MobilePre, so
        I get to hear the playback on good speakers instead of lo-fi computer
        speakers. The MobilePre has a headphone port for zero-latency
        monitoring during recording, which is a nice thing to have. The
        Behringer mixer (Europower 1280S) isn’t really intended to be a studio
        mixer; it’s for powering live shows, which it does most ably, because
        it is an integrated mixer and 1200-watt amplifier. When I’m recording
        a live show, I hook up to it with a laptop and the MobilePre. I also
        have a Zoom H2 portable digital recorder, which I can use in place of
        the laptop plus MobilePre. The best-quality recordings at live shows
        come from plugging directly into the mixer board.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0026" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The local old-time country band that I like to listen to and
          record has a rather eccentric sound system. They have a nice PA
          system, but instead of plugging everyone into the mixer board, only
          the singers’ mics are connected to the mixer. All of the musicians
          have to bring their own instrument amplifiers. This makes for a
          cluttered stage, and recording is a nightmare—plugging a recorder
          into the mixer means the only instruments it hears are whatever the
          mics pick up. The Zoom H2 has a neat little adapter to mount it on a
          mic stand so I can position it anywhere, but it’s not as good as a
          proper setup with everything routed through the sound board.</p></div><p>Let’s take a closer look at the MobilePre because it is
        representative of a lot of USB recording interfaces. The MobilePre
        supplies 48v phantom power for condenser mics and has XLR and TRS
        jacks, a 1/8″ stereo input, two 1/4″ mono outputs, and a 1/8″
        zero-latency headphone port for monitoring. Both dynamic and condenser
        mics can plug into the XLR jacks, as long as they have XLR connectors.
        You could also use an XLR-to-TRS adapter to plug a dynamic mic into
        one of the 1/4″ inputs. Its built-in ADC supports sampling rates from
        8 to 48 kHz at 16 bits, and it draws its power from the USB bus of
        your computer, so it doesn’t need its own power cord. It has physical
        gain control knobs and a volume control knob for headphones, so you
        don’t need to dink around with software controls. (I’d rather twist a
        knob than fumble around some weirdo software interface any day.) You
        should be able to find one for under $150. At 16-bit/48 MHz maximum
        recording quality, it’s becoming obsolete because comparable devices
        support 24-bit recording. Still, it’s a great little device, and
        because it is USB 1.1 class-compliant, it runs on any computer without
        special drivers.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch02.html#m-audio_mobilepre_comma_front._from_left" title="Figure 2-3. M-Audio MobilePre, front.

One way
      is to use a simple two-track recording interface like the MobilePre. It
      supports up to six inputs at once and routes them into two channels.
      There are no mixer controls, so this requires some finicking during
      recording to get a decent balance. A better way to do multichannel
      recording with a two-channel interface like the Pre is to record two
      tracks at a time, giving each instrument or performer its own individual
      track, rather than trying to cram them all through the Pre at once. Then
      Audacity is your mixer, and you have individual control of each track.
      Another option for two-channel recording is a good-quality two-channel
      PCI sound card like the Emu 1616M PCI, which you can find used for under
      $200. It comes with a breakout box that supports all kinds of plug-ins,
      24-bit/192 kHz recording, phantom power, and preamps.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><p>My Behringer 1280S gets pressed into service when I have a larger
      group over for recording. Any analog mixer will work as long you have an
      ADC/DAC to plug it into. My setup is a bit of a hack job since the
      Behringer is not really a studio mixer, but it works and sounds good,
      and it is an example of how a little ingenuity goes far in the wild
      world of audio. Like many mixers, the Behringer outputs to two-channel
      stereo, so I need to get the mix right during recording—I’ll have only
      two channels to work with in Audacity. I could also record one or two
      tracks at a time with the Behringer and then knit them together in
      Audacity; there is no rule that says you have to plug in everything at

      once as your recording interface supports. Older versions max out at 16.
      This is where FireWire and the higher-end PCI sound cards shine, because
      they allow recording many tracks at once. The Focusrite Saffire Pro 40
      is an example of a good value in a FireWire recording interface at about
      $500; this gives you 8 mic preamps, 20 total inputs and 20 outputs,
      24/96 recording, blinky LEDs, and phantom power on every mic channel.
      The M-Audio Delta 1010 is a popular higher-end multichannel PCI sound
      card that connects to a rack-mount breakout box. It goes for about
      $600.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0047" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A cool new family of devices is USB and FireWire mixers. These
      give you everything in one device—preamps, phantom power, mixer board,
      ADC/DAC, and direct plug-in to your computer. There are a lot of nice
      choices in the $300 to $1,000 range. Behringer’s line of Xenyx USB
      mixers costs between $150 to $600. They use class-compliant USB 1.1, so
      they plug into any computer with no special drivers needed. The M-Audio
      NRV10 is a nice little FireWire mixer/preamp that costs about
      $700.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0049" class="indexterm"/></p><p>How to choose which of these to use? USB and FireWire are portable
      and easy to hook up. PCI Express is the fastest. One lane of PCI-E moves
      about 250MBps both ways at the same time. That’s 250 megabytes, not
      mega-bits. Plain old PCI maxes out at 133MBps. Also, unlike PCI-E, PCI
      uses a shared bus, so more PCI devices means more bandwidth contention.
      Every PCI-E device has its own dedicated data pipeline, so PCI-E devices
      don’t have to share bandwidth. USB 1.1 is rated at 12Mbps (megabits per
      second), and USB 2.0 is rated at about 480Mbps, but both figures are
      highly theoretical, and in real life you’re likely to get half that.
      FireWire is rated at 400Mbps. However, FireWire gives you higher
      sustained throughput and better performance than USB, a difference that
      is discussed in more detail in the following section.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0050" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A common problem with internal sound cards is picking up noise and
      electrical interference from hard drives, power supplies, and fans
      inside your computer case. This usually isn’t a problem with the better
      sound cards like Emu, M-Audio, and RME Hammerfall, but it tends to be
      more of an issue with consumer-level and gamer sound cards and
      low-budget onboard sound. If you are getting some noise, the first thing
      to check is all your connections—make sure everything is hooked up
      correctly and anything that needs to be grounded is grounded. Sometimes
      moving a PCI card to a different slot makes a difference. Check your
      motherboard manual to see if you have shared PCI slots; you don’t want
      to use a shared slot if the other slot is populated.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0051" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      also consider FireWire devices. How do you choose between FireWire or
      USB? USB devices usually cost less than FireWire, but the trade-off is
      you may get poorer performance because of the differences in the two
      protocols.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0056" class="indexterm"/></p><p>All FireWire interfaces have special controller chips, so they do
      not add any extra load to your computer’s CPU. FireWire is a peer
      protocol, which means FireWire devices negotiate bus conflicts without
      using host CPU cycles. FireWire gives you two operating modes to choose
      from: asynchronous or isynchronous. Isynchronous mode means a device can
      reserve a certain portion of bandwidth all for itself that no other
      devices can use. So there are no collisions, which translates into high
      sustained throughput.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0057" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If your PC doesn’t have a FireWire interface, it’s easy to add
      one. PCI FireWire interfaces cost about $50, and many laptops include a
      FireWire port. When you’re shopping for FireWire audio interfaces, be
      sure to check for hardware compatibility. As one example, the Presonus
      FP10 has known conflicts with certain video chipsets, and it has a
      limited set of FireWire interfaces that it is known to work well
      with.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="the_future_of_firewire"/><p class="title">The Future of FireWire</p><p>“FireWire is doomed!” is a common cry of late. That may be true,
        though it is going to be with us for some years yet. USB 2.0
        supposedly offers the potential to equal FireWire performance, and USB
        3.0 supposedly will eclipse it. Audio hardware manufacturers have been
        slow to release USB 2.0 recording interfaces, though there are now a
        respectable number of them. A lot of them rely on custom drivers that
        are not USB 2.0 compliant, so shop carefully lest you buy one that
        won’t run on your computer. USB 3.0 is still a work in progress, and
        audio hardware manufacturers are not known for moving quickly. If you
        like FireWire recording devices, by all means buy and use them, and if
        FireWire ever does become obsolete, you can still use your gear
        because nobody is going to come and take it away from you.</p></div><p>USB operates only in asynchronous mode.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Asynchronous</em></span> means that any device on the same bus
      can send data whenever it wants to, so sometimes there are collisions,
      which cause latency. USB is host-dependent and puts a load on the CPU,
      which can also cause latency. Latency is the enemy of quality
      audio.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0059" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You’ll see a lot of USB audio devices that still use USB 1.1. USB
      1.1 has two speeds: 1.5Mbps and 12Mbps. The latter is also called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>full-speed</em></span>. It’s unlikely that a USB recording
      interface will be geared down to 1.5Mbps. The number of channels you can
      record at once depends on the quality level you want to record at. CD
      quality, two channels at 16/44.1, has a bitrate of 1,411,200Mbps. Two
      channels at 24/96 equals a bitrate of 4,608,000Mbps, so it seems you
      could record four 24/96 channels at once. However, that 12Mbps maximum
      is theoretical, and your real-world throughput will be half that or
      less. Most likely you’ll be limited to two-channel 24/96 recording at
      best. Four channels at 16/44.1 or 24/48 are possible if you are careful
      and have a good, fast multicore PC and have it tuned for audio
      production.

      them are not USB class-compliant and instead supply their own special
      drivers. Even Windows users have to do their homework because vendors
      are slow to release drivers for new Windows releases. Mac support is
      decent overall, and Linux, Unix, and users on other platforms are at the
      back of the bus as usual. Some multitrack USB 2.0 devices are getting
      good reviews. For example, the M-Audio Fast Track Ultra 8R (eight in,
      eight out) gets high marks and works on Mac, Linux, and
      Windows.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0063" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      onstage in combination with dynamic mics on drum kits; the condenser
      mics hang overhead to capture cymbals and transients, and dynamic mics
      are placed next to the drums. <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#audio-technica_stereo_condenser_mic_comm" title="Figure 2-9. Audio-Technica stereo condenser mic, Behringer dynamic mic, and wind sock">Figure 2-9</a> shows an

      is turned off before you plug one in to a phantom-powered XLR jack. It
      shouldn’t damage the mic, but it will change how it sounds. It’s common
      to see audio gear with both types of microphone connectors, and newer
      devices have combination jacks that accept both.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0071" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0072" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0073" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0074" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0075" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0078" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The little Audio-Technica Pro 24 stereo condenser mic in <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#audio-technica_stereo_condenser_mic_comm" title="Figure 2-9. Audio-Technica stereo condenser mic, Behringer dynamic mic, and wind sock">Figure 2-9</a> is a different

      small diaphragm (SDM). Both record sounds evenly and accurately across
      their entire range, though LDMs have a reputation for creating a
      “warmer” sound. A large diaphragm mic has a better low-frequency range
      than a small diaphragm, but a small diaphragm mic of the same type has a
      better high-frequency response. Low tones are characterized as warmer,
      and high tones are characterized as cooler and brighter. You’re going to
      hear all kinds of characterizations for sound quality: warm, cold,
      brittle, soft, hard, bright, dull, and on and on. Trust your own

      response and are less accurate than condenser mics. They are rugged, are
      moisture-resistant, and don’t need a power supply, so dynamic mics go on
      stage and in the field. Dynamic mics generally cover the human vocal
      range plus a little bit, so this makes them good for singers.</p><p>Another type of microphone is worth consideration, and that is the
      ribbon mic, which is a type of dynamic mic. The guts of ribbon mic are a
      metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. These are expensive but are
      prized for their clarity, spatial depth, and realism. They
      revolutionized the audio industries back in the 1930s; ribbon
      microphones set new standards for realism and accuracy that the
      condenser mics of the day could not match. Ribbon mics fell out of favor
      somewhat as condenser and dynamic mics improved. They were expensive,
      the metal ribbon was fragile, and their output was so low they needed
      more amplification than other types of microphones. Modern ribbon mics
      are more affordable and durable and produce louder output than their
      ancestors, so they’re definitely worth trying (<a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#a_modern_aea_r84_ribbon_mic" title="Figure 2-10. A modern AEA R84 ribbon mic">Figure 2-10</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0081" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Ribbon mics are natively bidirectional, which means they are
      sensitive to sounds from both the front and the rear of the mic in a
      figure-eight pattern. They are effective at blocking sound from the
      sides. The figure-eight pattern is on the horizontal axis, so you can
      tip them sideways to get a different effect. A pair of matched ribbon
      mics placed next to each other at a 90-degree angle is called a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Blumlein pair</em></span>, or crossed figure eight. This
      creates a realistic stereo image. If you don’t want to capture sounds
      from one side, for example the audience side, you’ll have to block it
      somehow or find a ribbon mic with the capture pattern that you

        vehicle), and your mood and expectations. We’ve grown up with decades
        of recorded audio of all types: acetate, vinyl, different types of
        tape, and now digital. So what sounds “right” is heavily flavored by
        what we’re used to hearing. Some folks still hanker for the sound of
        tinny ’60s AM radio or boomy jukeboxes or quadrophonic eight-tracks.
        Some believe that vinyl sounds “warmer” than digital and that tube

        long warm-up period or they sound “cold.”<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0103" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0104" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0105" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0106" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0107" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0108" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0109" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0110" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are real differences between tube and solid-state. Tube
        amplifier systems drive a transformer, which in turn drives the
        speakers. The transformer suppresses a lot of transients like spikes,
        pops, and clicks, resulting in a cleaner sound. A cold preamp has more
        noise than a hot preamp. Tubes also have a singular noise source,
        whereas semiconductor devices have multiple noise sources, increasing
        the amount of noise you might hear. Still, on good-quality gear it’s
        going to take some mighty fine hearing to detect the
        difference.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0111" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0112" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It is nearly impossible to define a “pure” experience, because
        even live performances are colored by their environments and
        equipment, ambience, and the way our brains process data. It always
        surprises me how much worse my favorite local band sounds on the
        recordings I make of its performances. During the shows, I’m having a
        great time and thinking they sound wonderful. Then later when I hear
        the playback, I hear all kinds of flaws: off tempo, out of key,
        lackluster, you name it. Maybe I’m too picky and too attuned to
        listening for mistakes on recordings; maybe during the live shows my
        brain is too busy having fun to notice flaws. Maybe I make lousy
        recordings.</p><p>The moral is sound quality depends on your own ears and
        experience—what sounds good and right to you is what matters. You can
        try for the most realistic fidelity or try for the best artistic and
        creative fidelity. It’s all subjective.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Microphone Cables"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="microphone_cables"/>Microphone Cables</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many brands of microphone cables, and you can waste a
        lot of money on a snooty brand name. Don’t spend a mint; there are
        many reasonably priced, good-quality choices. You may run into some
        confusion over <span class="emphasis"><em>balanced</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>unbalanced</em></span> cables. In the context of connecting
        microphones, an unbalanced cable is a coaxial cable that terminates in
        a tip-sleeve (TS) connector. It has a single conductor wire surrounded
        by a combination shield and ground. These are effective at blocking
        external interference but are vulnerable to induced hum and noise and
        tend to be noisier than balanced cables. A balanced cable terminates
        in either a three-pin XLR connector or a TRS connector. It has two
        internal wires, one hot and one cold, surrounded by a shield that is
        not part of the signal path, so it supplies a cleaner signal. Balanced
        cables can run for much longer distances than unbalanced cables
        without picking up excessive noise.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0113" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0114" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0115" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Keep in mind that it is the signal that is balanced or
        unbalanced, and using a balanced cable will not make an unbalanced
        signal balanced. However, a TS cable will convert a balanced signal to
        unbalanced. You need to match your cables to your mics and your
        preamp, amp, mixer, or whatever you might be plugging into. Condenser
        mics that depend on phantom power mostly likely use three-pin XLR
        balanced cables, and dynamic micsuse balanced cables with both XLR and
        TRS connectors. A balanced signal doesn’t care what carries it, so you
        can use XLR-to-TRS adapters as needed, provided that whatever you’re
        plugging into sends the correct signal.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0116" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0117" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0118" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0119" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0120" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0121" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0122" class="indexterm"/></p><p>These days this shouldn’t be something that you have to spend a
        lot of time figuring out, since most contemporary audio gear supports
        balanced mic connections.</p><p>Microphone cables are either stiff or flexible, depending on
        where they’re going to be used. Flexible cables are for live
        performances, and stiff cables usually reside in studios where they
        are not moved very often.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0123" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0124" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Don’t cross electric lines with any of your audio cables if you
        can help it, because you may pick up interference. If you have to,
        cross them at right angles to reduce the overlap.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Smart Miking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="smart_miking"/>Smart Miking</h2></div></div></div><p>Placing your microphones for best results is an art in itself,
        and the only way to get good at it is to practice a lot. You want to
        be as close as possible but not so close that you pick up electronic
        interference or unwanted sounds such as lip smacks and spit from
        vocalists. Pop filters are helpful for vocalists, and windscreens are
        essential for outdoor recording.</p><p>The “3-to-1 rule” is a simple guide for microphone placement for
        live performances or in the studio when you have several mics and
        performers set up at the same time in the same room. When microphones
        are placed too close together, you may get squeals, dips and peaks, or
        other forms of unpleasant interference. The 3-to-1 rule means the
        distance between adjacent mics should be approximately three times the
        distance between the mic and the sound source. If there are multiple
        amps present, as with my fave local band where every performer lugs
        their own amp onstage, these will cause problems too. Sometimes simply
        turning an amp to face in a different direction will cure feedback
        problems.</p><p>Microphone stands are essential—don’t depend on hand-holding.
        Goosenecks take up less space and are fast to adjust, but over time
        they wear out. Boom stands last forever but take up more space. Some
        folks prefer tripod feet, which I always trip over, so I prefer
        weighted bases. Shock mounts and cages are great for isolating your
        mics from vibrations and don’t cost very much.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0125" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Microphone Preamp"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="microphone_preamp"/>Microphone Preamp</h1></div></div></div><p>Microphone preamps are the second most important devices in your
      audio chain, after ADC/DACs. As I’ve already talked about in this
      chapter, I have an M-Audio MobilePre and a Focusrite Saffire Pro 26.
      With these I don’t need an internal computer sound card or separate
      preamp, because they have their own built-in microphone preamps.
      However, even if you prefer to use an internal sound card or have good
      external recording interfaces, you may still want to use a separate
      microphone preamp. Let’s talk about why the preamp is so
      important.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0126" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0127" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A preamp—short for <span class="emphasis"><em>preamplifier</em></span>—amplifies a
      low-level signal to <span class="emphasis"><em>line level</em></span>. The output from a
      microphone, a turntable, and many instrument pickups is lower than line
      level. Line level is a standard analog audio signal voltage that is
      designed for connecting different audio components. What is this
      voltage? Well, that’s a good question because even though it is billed
      as a standard voltage, it varies depending on the manufacturer. Most are
      around 1 to 2 volts. A preamp has a significant effect on audio quality:
      A low-quality preamp will introduce noise and distortion. A good preamp
      amplifies the signal cleanly, without introducing defects or
      color.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0128" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0129" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0130" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Audio terminology gets bent in all kinds of ways—many of the
        preamps you see for home hi-fi systems are not like microphone preamps
        because they don’t do any amplification but are just switching units
        where you plug everything in.</p></div><p>Preamps range from bare-bones models that supply only
      <span class="emphasis"><em>gain</em></span> (amplification) and phantom power to gaudy
      delights larded up with all kinds of special effects, dials, and blinky
      lights. A lot of audio devices come with gobs of special effects because
      it costs practically nothing to add them, and they make you feel like
      you’re getting something special. If you like lots of special effects,
      this is a nice bonus; just don’t let it distract you from a device’s
      real quality. At the least it is nice to have some physical knobs.
      Debates over which preamps are best almost take on a religious quality.
      Professionals might spend thousands of dollars on a single preamp.
      You’re welcome to do this, but in my opinion you’re better off starting
      out with inexpensive gear and investing in perfecting your recording
      techniques. Then when you’re ready to move up to better gear, you’ll
      appreciate the difference and know how to get the most out of
      it.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0131" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Speakers and Headphones"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="speakers_and_headphones"/>Speakers and Headphones</h1></div></div></div><p>Having both speakers and headphones in your audio chain lets you
      hear your recordings in different ways. Studio monitor speakers are
      supposedly dead-flat and accurate and don’t add any color of their own.
      They also tend to be expensive. My own studio speakers are a set of nice
      JBL three-way speakers. They’re not real studio monitors, just nice
      speakers that I like. Headphones are essential—you need these for
      monitoring your recordings. Audio interfaces that include built-in
      zero-latency headphone ports are perfect for monitoring. I seem to
      collect headphones: I have a nice Plantronics USB headset, which is
      great for recording podcasts; a set of Sennheiser headphones with an
      ordinary 1/4″ TRS plug; and wireless Audio-Technica headphones. My
      studio speakers are powered by a nice old Pioneer SA 7500 stereo
      amplifier. I’ve had it repaired twice, and I’m going to keep it going as
      long as I can. It’s rated at 45 watts per channel, which doesn’t sound
      like much, but it powers those watts with some serious amperage. Amps
      are the real measure of power in an amplifier; that is what makes the
      difference between a wimpy amp and a good strong clean amp. Wattage
      doesn’t mean all that much—that’s just the number salespeople like to
      focus on.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0132" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0133" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0134" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0135" class="indexterm"/></p><p>None of this is super-duper hi-fi, at least not according to fussy

      CPU and a lot of RAM. My studio PC has an AMD Phenom triple-core CPUs
      with 4GB RAM. Multicore CPUs make a big difference. A single-core CPU
      should perform fine for two-track recording and simpler recordings like
      podcasts and interviews. For example, I have an old ThinkPad with an 800
      MHz CPU and 256MB RAM running Linux that performs nicely as a field
      recorder for interviews. For more than two tracks, multicore is the way
      to go. Don’t worry about AMD versus Intel; they’re both fine, so use
      whichever you like best.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0147" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0148" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0149" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You need as much storage as you can afford. CD-quality audio (44.1
      kHz, 16-bit WAV) uses around 5MB per track per minute. Don’t forget to
      add up all the tracks you are using and all the retakes. You can buy
      terabyte hard drives, and by the time you read this, they’ll probably be
      even larger. Another option is to combine the capacity of several hard
      drives in a RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) array. The two
      RAID levels that are useful for audio production are RAID 0 and RAID 10.
      RAID 0, also called <span class="emphasis"><em>striping</em></span>, makes two hard disks
      look like one, so two 500GB drives appear as a single terabyte drive.
      RAID 0 is very fast but has the same weakness as a single drive—if one
      drive in the array fails, you’ll probably lose all of your
      data.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0150" class="indexterm"/></p><p>RAID 10 (using a good-quality hardware controller) is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>mirroring</em></span> plus striping, so you get speed and
      redundancy. Use a good-quality hardware controller; you don’t want some
      cheapie that dumps more load on your CPU but instead one that handles
      the load itself. It’s more expensive of disks than the popular RAID 5,
      but it’s more reliable and a lot faster—you get faster reads and writes
      and much faster recovery from a failed drive. I wouldn’t use RAID 5 or 6
      arrays for audio recording; in fact, I don’t use them at all anymore
      because they’re too fragile, they’re too slow for writes, and they
      propagate parity errors too readily.</p><p>I wouldn’t worry about building some super-duper RAID array for
      recording and editing with Audacity, unless you find yourself burning
      through tera-byte hard drives all the time. I use a single large hard
      drive on my studio PC and am ruthless with housekeeping and getting rid
      of unneeded files. I use a nice little four-disk Linux-powered RAID 10
      server for backups.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0151" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Operating Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="operating_systems"/>Operating Systems</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book I will be covering both Linux and Windows. Each one
      has its strengths and pitfalls. If you’re a Windows user, XP is still
      the most reliable version even though Vista and Windows 7 have been
      released. You’ll get the best hardware and software support and the best
      performance. Vista presents special problems because of its own high
      hardware requirements—it may bog down your system to the point that you
      can’t comfortably use it for audio recording, and driver support for
      many audio devices is immature. Audio hardware manufacturers seem a
      little more interested in Windows 7, but it is still a hog compared to
      XP. If you want to upgrade from XP, don’t bother with Vista; go straight
      to Windows 7. If your audio hardware and software work well on XP, then
      keep them as long as you can.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0152" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0153" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0154" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0155" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Linux users have the usual hassles with hardware manufacturers

      consolation, a lot of audio hardware vendors don’t release very good
      Windows drivers either. Why? Who knows; it is a mystery that I waste too

<div class="sect1" title="Portable Recording"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="portable_recording"/>Portable Recording</h1></div></div></div><p>There are several good methods for field recording. My two
      favorites are to fix up a netbook as a portable recording studio or to
      use a portable digital recorder. Netbooks are so cool; I’ve been wishing
      for netbooks ever since I discovered computers. Ordinary laptops work
      fine too, and you get more powerful CPUs. You have all the same options
      as you do with a desktop computer—your choice of preamps, mixers, and
      other audio interfaces, microphones, software—and you can do all of your
      editing on the spot and even burn CDs. You also have a nice screen and
      keyboard, instead of the tiny screens and buttons found on portable
      digital recorders.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0159" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Pocket digital recorders work wonderfully well and are fun. These
      range from tiny keychain fobs that are the audio equivalent of sticky
      notes to little recorders for good-quality voice dictation to
      high-quality multichannel recorders. Let’s see what goes into a
      high-quality unit.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0160" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0161" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0162" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0163" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0164" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0165" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0166" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_zoom_h2_with_an_rca-to-1_solidus_8p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e3938"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797475.png.jpg" alt="The Zoom H2 with an RCA-to-1/8″ stereo plug adapter for connecting to a mixer or any other two-channel stereo RCA recording or line output"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-12. The Zoom H2 with an RCA-to-1/8″ stereo plug adapter for
        connecting to a mixer or any other two-channel stereo RCA recording or
        line output</p></div><p>There are a large number of them that are priced reasonably, and
      you can slip one in your pocket and carry it anywhere. Carry extra
      batteries and some extra storage cards, and you’re ready for anything.
      My personal favorite is the Zoom Handy H2 (<a class="xref" href="ch02s09.html#the_zoom_h2_with_an_rca-to-1_solidus_8p" title="Figure 2-12. The Zoom H2 with an RCA-to-1/8″ stereo plug adapter for connecting to a mixer or any other two-channel stereo RCA recording or line output">Figure 2-12</a>). It runs on two AA
      batteries and also has an AC adapter. It has four built-in good-quality
      microphones, so you can record either in two-channel stereo or in
      four-channel surround. It has no speakers, but it comes with earbuds,
      and it can also be used as a USB audio interface on a computer. Its 1/8″
      line input can be connected directly to the sound board at concerts, and
      it also accepts an external microphone. It uses SD cards for storage and
      supports both WAV and MP3 file formats. It costs about $150.</p><p>Some other popular and excellent portable digital recorders are
      the Olympus LS10, Marantz PMD 620, Marantz PMD 660, Sony PCM-D50, Yamaha
      Pocketrak 2G, and Zoom H4. All are under $600, and all have built-in
      mics. Ideally you’ll be able to get your hands on them and give them
      good test drives before purchase because they share a common
      weakness—tiny LCD control panels with complicated menus. You’ll also
      want to test noise levels, because some of them are nice and quiet when
      you use the internal mics but are scratchety with external mics. Most of
      them accept external mics—some have only 1/8″ mini-jacks, and some
      accept full-sized XLR or TRS plugs. The ones that have XLR jacks don’t
      always supply phantom power for condenser mics. A nice option is to use
      a battery-powered condenser mic, and then you don’t have to worry about
      phantom power.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0167" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0168" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0169" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Devices that supply phantom power usually advertise “48v phantom
        power.” But few mics actually use 48 volts. They usually use much
        less—as little as 8 to 10 volts.</p></div><p>Some other things to look at are battery life, type, and size of
      storage cards. Does it have any built-in storage, and what audio file
      formats does it support? Does it come with useful accessories such as AC
      adapters, windscreen, earbuds, and stands?</p><p>An interesting variation is the M-Audio Micro Track II. This has
      no built-in mics but is a miniature two-channel recording studio meant
      to be used with high-quality external mics. It supports both dynamic and
      condenser mics and supplies a full 48v phantom power for condenser
      mics.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0170" class="indexterm"/></p><p>I prefer to use a USB card reader for transferring files from a
      portable recorder to my computer. Usually it’s faster, and it doesn’t
      run down recorder batteries.</p></div>

      noises. Our brains are wonderful at ignoring sounds we don’t want to pay
      attention to, but microphones give equal attention to all noises.
      Blocking unwanted noise is harder than it sounds because our modern
      world is very noisy: vehicle traffic, airplanes, appliances, televisions
      and stereos, fluorescent lights, $2,000 powered subwoofers roaming the
      streets at 120 decibels in $500 cars, construction, and so forth.
      High-frequency noises are easier to block than low-frequency sounds, as
      we all know from our futile attempts to escape those four-wheeled
      powered subwoofers, which pound their way through all
      barriers.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0171" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Computers add their own sounds—it’s common to pick up hard drive
      and fan noise. So before you stock up on fancy recording equipment, job
      one is preparing your recording studio:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Use a quiet room with sound-absorbing walls or wall coverings.
          Old carpet and blankets work as well as spendy acoustic foam.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Place a good directional microphone close to whatever you are
          recording and aim it carefully.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Shield your mic from your PC.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Adjust your sound levels carefully, neither too low nor too
          high.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Mount your microphones in shock cages.</p></li></ul></div><p>But, you may ask, why go to all that trouble? Why not just fix it
      later? It’s all just software anyway. My dear reader, if it were as easy
      as silly TV shows and movies portray it, there would be no need for
      soundproofed music recording studios, and no one would ever holler,
      “Quiet on the set!” You can mitigate problems somewhat in Audacity, but
      you get better results making as good a recording as possible and saving
      the fix-its for problems you can’t avoid. It’s nothing like crime shows
      where ace audio techs can clean up any recording, no matter how mangled,
      to perfect high fidelity. That’s beyond fiction and well into
      fantasy.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="hearing_ranges"/><p class="title">Hearing Ranges</p><p>People who live in so-called primitive societies, without all of
        our modern “conveniences,” retain keen hearing well into old age. I
        suppose if they wanted to make audio recordings, they wouldn’t have to
        work so hard at blocking unwanted background noises.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0172" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0173" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0174" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0175" class="indexterm"/></p><p>American Indians and Australia’s Aborigines are reported to have
        hearing ranges of 10 Hz to 25 kHz. The average person is on the order
        of 32 Hz to 18 kHz. The excellent technical reviewer for this book,
        Alvin Goats, has an extended hearing range of about 22 kHz. It is not
        as cool as it sounds because most sounds above 18 kHz are noise: fans,
        power supplies, speaker distortions, and such. He is sometimes accused
        of being hard of hearing due to all of the extra sounds masking what
        other people are saying.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0176" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Gordon Hempton is a wonderful artist who calls himself the Sound
        Tracker (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.soundtracker.com/">http://www.soundtracker.com/</a>). Mr.
        Hempton has made a career out of recording the pure sounds of nature,
        with no human sounds at all. In 1992 he recorded the chorus of dawn
        around the globe. In later years he recorded the sounds of the
        Mississippi river according to the writings of Mark Twain and the
        sounds of Yosemite National Park according to the writings of John
        Muir. He uses a Neumann KU-81i Dummy Head (named Fritz) to simulate as
        closely as possible how we hear sounds. He has a released a number of
        high-quality CDs so you can hear what a world without noisy people
        sounds like.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0177" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Mr. Hempton began his recording career in the early 1980s. A lot
        of the locations that he recorded back then are now too noisy to
        record.</p></div><p>Your PC should be dedicated to the job and not used for anything
      else, neither gaming nor web surfing nor emailing nor anything, because
      you want all of your computer’s power dedicated to recording. If you
      don’t, you risk generating skips and stutters. Turn off screensavers,
      all power management, and any antivirus or antimalware software.
      (Windows users, do I need to say, don’t be connected to the Internet
      after doing this?) Turn off all unnecessary services, scheduled jobs,
      and everything that is not essential.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0178" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0179" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Your microphone will pick up noise, vibrations, and interference
      from a surprising number of sources. If you still have an old cathode
      ray tube (CRT) monitor, replace it with a modern flat thin-film
      transistor liquid crystal diode (TFT-LCD) monitor, because CRTs emit
      radiation and noise. Sometimes they even resonate to certain sounds and
      create echoes.</p><p>You can make an effective sound barrier between mic and computer
      for cheap by attaching a piece of carpet to a piece of plywood or
      particle board. Give it feet so it stands on its own, and you have the
      equivalent of an expensive piece of a high-tech sound barrier. Both
      laptop and desktop machines should sit on nonresonating surfaces. In a
      pinch, you can set your laptop on a coat or a pillow, being careful to
      not block its cooling vents.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="donat_smoke"/><p class="title">Don’t Smoke</p><p>Smoking is bad for you, and it’s bad for computers and audio
        gear, especially microphones. It’s nasty for visitors to your
        studio—they may not appreciate breathing secondhand smoke and having
        to shower and change after they leave.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0180" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Although many how-tos advise making your studio as acoustically
      “dead” as possible, without any echoes or resonance, feel free to
      experiment. You might like how some things sound in a space with some
      hard surfaces. Psycho-acoustics come into play in professional recording
      studios; they don’t make perfect anechoic chambers because those are so
      flat that they sound unpleasant. There is no sound reflection, nothing
      that gives depth to sound. So, professional studios reduce the amount of
      random noise while preserving some depth to the sound.</p></div>
