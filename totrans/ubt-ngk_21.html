Ubuntu suffers from its fair share of annoyances, and although I seem to spend far less time fixing things on Ubuntu than I ever used to on Windows, it's best not to ignore the possibility that you might some day experience a hardware hiccup or sticky software situation.</p><p>The purpose of this chapter is to arm you with some general-purpose tips, tricks, and troubleshooting hints. You'll find explicit instructions on how to fix several specific problems, but for the most part I've tried to keep the discussion general. This is because the way you resolve some issues will depend heavily on the peculiarities of your setup, and there just isn't a bookshelf big enough for a guide that covers every possible eventuality in suitable detail. Fortunately, the Internet harbors a sizable collection of Ubuntu-related guides, so even if you don't arrive at the exact answer you were looking for here, I hope you'll be able to use some of my tips to help you find the right information on the Web.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1738" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you've run into a problem, flip through this chapter to see whether there's anything that might help. I've covered problems with installation, booting, sound and video, Internet and network connections, hard disks and storage, and displays and graphics cards, along with pesky software issues such as programs freezing or slowing down your computer. If you're not beset by any particular computer quandary, you might like to skim through this chapter to give you some idea of what to do if misfortune does befall you in the future. Or, you could take my preferred route: Make yourself a hot beverage and head back to the games chapter (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. FEATHERED FLIPPERS">Chapter 17</a>) for some well-deserved R&amp;R.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1739" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="I Can't Get Ubuntu Installed"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="i_can_apostrophy_t_get_ubuntu_installed"/>I Can't Get Ubuntu Installed</h1></div></div></div><p>Not being able to install Ubuntu is a particularly unhappy problem because it means that you've probably been denied all the fun from the previous 20 chapters of this book! Never fear; there's plenty you can do to convince Ubuntu to install itself on your computer, and if you're still struggling, you can try alternative installation methods like booting from a USB stick, which I've covered in <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. INSTALLING UBUNTU FROM A USB FLASH DRIVE">Appendix A</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1740" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1741" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1742" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1743" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1744" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1745" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="My Computer Won't Boot from the CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="my_computer_won_apostrophy_t_boot_from_t"/>My Computer Won't Boot from the CD</h2></div></div></div><p>If you tried to start your computer from the Ubuntu installation CD but never even got to the purple boot screen (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a>) or if the computer just boots into Windows every time, try one of the following options:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Check the boot order</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>When your computer starts up (<span class="emphasis"><em>boots</em></span>), it goes through a list of devices in a set order, checking to see whether they have an operating system on them. As soon as it finds an operating system, the computer will boot from that device, and it won't check any of the other devices. This means that if the hard disk comes before the CD drive in the boot order, the computer will boot from the hard disk rather than the CD drive. To boot from the CD, you need to make sure that the CD drive comes first in the boot order. See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a> for instructions on setting up the boot order correctly.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Check the integrity of the CD</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>You could have a faulty or damaged CD that your computer isn't able to boot from. It's possible to check whether a disc has faults on it by doing a <span class="emphasis"><em>checksum</em></span> test. A checksum is sort of like a fingerprint; you take the checksum of your Ubuntu CD and compare it with the checksum of an Ubuntu CD that is known to be free of faults. If there is but one tiny difference between the two discs, the checksums will be different too—the fingerprints won't match. Ubuntu uses the MD5SUM program to do its checksums. Go to <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/</a>, and scroll down to the "MD5SUM on Windows" section to see how you can find the checksum of your disc. If it turns out that the checksums don't match, you'll need to get another CD (for example, by downloading a CD image from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/</a> or by contacting No Starch Press to ask for a replacement).<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1746" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1747" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Make sure you burned the disc correctly</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>If you downloaded a CD image (<span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span>) file instead of using the CD that came with this book, make sure that you burned the CD correctly. A common mistake that people make is to just copy the <span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span> file onto a CD, as if it were a normal file. This won't work; you need to use the Burn Disc Image option (or something similar) in your CD-burning software to do it properly.

To get around this particular annoyance, you might need to start the computer from a live CD (like the one included with this book) or use some special options to help the process along.</p><p>This section covers the two most common classes of boot problems, GRUB errors and kernel problems. There's some general advice for other types of boot problem too, including tips for dual-booters struggling to get Windows to start.</p><div class="sect2" title="I Get a GRUB Error"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i_get_a_grub_error"/>I Get a GRUB Error</h2></div></div></div><p>When you try to start your computer, you might be left with a black screen, which says that there was a GRUB error. This means there is a problem with the GRUB bootloader, which is responsible for telling your computer's hardware how to start Ubuntu. Fixing these errors tends to involve typing a few cryptic-looking commands or booting off a live CD, so be prepared for that. You can find a short guide to handling common GRUB errors at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#GRUB%20Errors/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#GRUB%20Errors/</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1755" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1756" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1757" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1758" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1759" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="I Get a Kernel Panic or the Computer Freezes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i_get_a_kernel_panic_or_the_computer_fre"/>I Get a Kernel Panic or the Computer Freezes</h2></div></div></div><p>Kernel panics have a scary name for a reason. If you get an error message saying that there was a kernel panic, something pretty serious went wrong in Linux-land, and you'll probably find that you can't use the computer until you fix the problem. Fortunately, such errors are rare, and even if you do get one, you should be able to fix it without too much work. I should also note that kernel panics are only serious in that they make it difficult to run software on the computer—the physical hardware side of your computer won't be damaged at all, so once you get the software working again, everything will be back to normal. So really, there's no need to panic at all.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1760" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1761" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Freezes and kernel panics often go hand in hand, but they're not necessarily the same thing. You've probably seen a computer freeze up before—moving the mouse or pressing keys on the keyboard does nothing, and the display stays frozen. If the computer freezes, all you can do is give it a minute or two to see whether it wakes up and, if not, restart the computer or turn it off by holding down the power button for a few seconds.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1762" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can try a few things if you keep getting kernel panics or freezes, detailed in the following sections. If nothing seems to be working, ask for advice in the Ubuntu forums, and, with a bit of luck, you'll soon be up and running again.</p><div class="sect3" title="Unplug Unnecessary Hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="unplug_unnecessary_hardware"/>Unplug Unnecessary Hardware</h3></div></div></div><p>A lot of freezes are caused by problems with hardware devices. If you recently bought some new hardware, try unplugging it and see whether you still get the freezes. If you recently installed some system updates, the driver for some hardware could be causing the problem too. It's worth unplugging any unnecessary hardware (such as scanners, printers, external hard drives, and the like) to check whether they're causing the problems.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Disable Restricted Drivers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="disable_restricted_drivers"/>Disable Restricted Drivers</h3></div></div></div><p>Some freezes are caused by problems with accelerated graphics drivers (see <a class="xref" href="ch21s05.html#games_solidus_compiz_don_apostrophy_t_wo" title="Games/Compiz Don't Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers">Games/Compiz Don't Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch21s05.html" title="Problems with the Display and Graphics Cards">Problems with the Display and Graphics Cards</a>) or restricted drivers for other hardware (see <a class="xref" href="ch21s04.html#installing_drivers_for_your_network_soli" title="Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card">Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card</a>, in <a class="xref" href="ch21s04.html#installing_drivers_for_your_network_soli" title="Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card">Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card</a>).

Assuming it's the latter, you'll find that most sound-related problems in Ubuntu are caused by using incorrect sound card settings. Unfortunately, the number of these settings tends to be overwhelming, and it's rarely obvious which ones you should change to get things working. Trial and error is the order of the day when it comes to sound problems, I'm afraid, although I've tried to explain as many of the relevant options as possible in this section to help you out.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1775" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1776" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1777" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If the problem has more to do with what you're not seeing than what you're not hearing, then you're possibly in for an easier ride.

I'll concentrate on some of the more basic issues in this section, but if none of this helps, you can always try the Ubuntu forums or IRC; both are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. A COLONY OF PENGUINS">Chapter 20</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1779" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1780" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1781" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1782" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1783" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1784" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To start troubleshooting, find a song on your computer and play it in Rhythmbox or the Totem Movie Player. (If you need it, there's a sample song available in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/share/example-content/Ubuntu_Free_Culture_Showcase</em></span> folder, aptly called "Frustration Blues.") You need to have a sound file playing constantly in the background so that you can tell whether changing any of these settings has worked.</p><p>If you are unable to even start playing the file, Ubuntu may not have detected your sound card properly. Open a Terminal (<span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>), type <strong class="userinput"><code>aplay -l</code></strong> into it, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.

A codec is a small piece of software that adds support for a given audio/video format into a program.

However, if they fail, try installing the Ubuntu restricted extras package—this package contains a lot of extra codecs. Once it's installed, close and re-open your audio/video file and see whether it plays. If not, you can try using a different program, which might have the right codec built-in.

Right-click a blank area of the folder that the file is stored in, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Permissions</strong></span> tab. If you are listed as the owner, make sure that your Folder Access permissions are set to Create and delete files. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span>, and then try to delete the file again.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1859" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you are not the owner of the folder, you'll have to gain ownership of it before you can delete the file. This is where you need to ask yourself, "Should I really be deleting someone else's file?" Sometimes file permissions get messed up and so the file might be yours—in that case, it's OK to delete it. If it's someone else's file, though, ask for their permission first. If you're convinced that deleting the file is a good idea, open a Terminal, and use the <strong class="userinput"><code>chown</code></strong> command to change the owner of the folder. Here's how it works: If I wanted to delete a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>cats.jpg</em></span> from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pets</em></span> folder in my <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder, I would type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo chown phil ˜/Pictures/Pets</code></strong>, followed by the enter <span class="keycap"><strong>key</strong></span> (remember, <span class="emphasis"><em>˜</em></span> means "my home folder"). After typing my password and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> again, I would become the owner of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pets</em></span> folder and could delete <span class="emphasis"><em>cats.jpg</em></span> as normal. Of course, you should substitute the name of the folder and your username in place of mine for this to work for you.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Don't use this method to delete system files (in other words, files that aren't stored in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/home</em></span> folder) unless you're sure you know what you're doing. You don't have permission to delete system files for a reason; you could really screw up your system if you remove something vital.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="sect1" title="Common Problems with Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="common_problems_with_applications"/>Common Problems with Applications</h1></div></div></div><p>So many applications are available for Ubuntu that it would be impossible to go through each one and point out what might possibly, some day, go wrong. Instead, in this section I've chosen to provide some general advice on how to deal with misbehaving programs, plus a sneaky little section on a particularly common Firefox problem. If it is something specific that you need to handle, it's never a bad idea to try looking at the help files for a given program. Selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Contents</strong></span> should get you to a manual for most software. Failing that, a Google search often does the trick for me.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1874" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Firefox Says It's Already Running"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="firefox_says_it_apostrophy_s_already_run"/>Firefox Says It's Already Running</h2></div></div></div><p>When you exit Firefox, it sometimes takes a while to close itself down properly—the window will disappear, but Firefox could still be running somewhere in the murky depths of your computer. When you try to open Firefox again, you may receive a message that Firefox is running in the background, so you can't open a new window. This is no good, because you want a Firefox window that you can see! If this happens, open a Terminal (<span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>), type <strong class="userinput"><code>killall firefox</code></strong>, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. (The command is case sensitive, so be sure you're typing in all lowercase.) This will force Firefox to shut down immediately. With that done, try to open Firefox again, and the window should pop up as normal.

Once you have the command, type it into the Terminal, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The program should run as normal, so keep using it until it crashes. When it does, look at the Terminal to see whether it left any clues as to what's going wrong in there. Error messages in the Terminal can be quite cryptic, so you might like to ask someone on the forums or IRC (both of which are discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. A COLONY OF PENGUINS">Chapter 20</a>) if they know what it means.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1875" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1876" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1877" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1878" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1879" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If the messages in the Terminal are no help, you should report a bug.

<div class="sect1" title="My Computer Is Running Slowly"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="my_computer_is_running_slowly"/>My Computer Is Running Slowly</h1></div></div></div><p>Certain tasks take up lots of computing power and cause your computer to run slowly. Burning a CD, installing software, and converting music files to a different format all tend to strain your system, so you shouldn't be surprised if things feel a little sluggish when something like that is running. But what if your computer is running slowly even if you're not running anything intensive? You can investigate the cause of the slowdown by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>System Monitor</strong></span> to open the System Monitor. Select the Resources tab, and check your CPU (processor) usage—if it's around 100 percent, then a program running in the background is probably responsible for the problem (for example, the one in <a class="xref" href="ch21s09.html#the_system_monitor_comma_showing_the_gwi" title="Figure 21-14. The System Monitor, showing the gwibber-service program using an unhealthy 89 percent of the processor">Figure 21-14</a>). Choose the Processes tab, and click the % CPU column heading a couple of times until it has an "up" arrow next to it. This will sort the list of programs in order of how much of the processor they are using. The one that's using all of the CPU should appear at the top of the list.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-1880" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-1881" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It's normally best to wait a few minutes and see whether the program reduces its CPU usage by itself. After all, it could be some system software running a scan or some other maintenance operation. If it doesn't go away, the program might have gotten stuck, so select it and click <span class="strong"><strong>End Process</strong></span> to force it to close. Your system should return to its usual speed within a few seconds.</p><p>If you didn't notice high CPU usage on the Resources tab, then it's possible that something is overusing your hard disk instead. Programs that do this almost always finish what they're doing within five or ten minutes, so you should probably ride it out. If it persists, the easiest way of fixing the problem is by restarting the computer.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_system_monitor_comma_showing_the_gwi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject21_d1e28614"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656765.png.jpg" alt="The System Monitor, showing the gwibber-service program using an unhealthy 89 percent of the processor"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-14. The System Monitor, showing the gwibber-service program using an unhealthy 89 percent of the processor</p></div></div>

This happens when you open an email attachment, for example—the file is put in the temporary folder by your email client and then opened using the default application for that type of file. Unfortunately, some programs don't realize that it's a temporary file, and they let you save it in the temporary directory . . . which is periodically wiped clean. If you suspect that this may have happened and you have restarted your computer since you last saved the file, then it's probably gone forever.</p><p>If you haven't restarted, there may still be hope; try opening the (unmodified, original) file again to see which folder it gets stored in by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span> (or similar) in the program you're using. Then, check which folder the Save window opens up to. For example, the Evolution mail client temporarily stores attachments that you open in a randomly named folder within the <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/username/.evolution/cache/tmp</em></span> folder (see <a class="xref" href="ch21s10.html#looking_for_a_file_that_was_saved_in_a_t" title="Figure 21-15. Looking for a file that was saved in a temporary folder by Evolution">Figure 21-15</a> for an example). Note the name of the folder, and open your home folder. Then, select <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span>, type the name of the folder in the box that appears, and try to find your file in the folder that opens.
