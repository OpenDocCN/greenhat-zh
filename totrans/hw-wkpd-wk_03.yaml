    itself, and fresh views and discoveries, such as a scientific advance or the exposure
    of a forgery, prompt new summaries of knowledge. But Wikipedia has allowed this
    metaphor to spring to life: Daily, thousands of people "rewrite the encyclopedia,"

    when the World Wide Web became a concrete proposal. Throughout the 1990s, technology

- en: What is an encyclopedia? To most people, an *encyclopedia* is a large book or
    multivolume work. Comprised of a comprehensive collection of short articles, an
    encyclopedia divides an area of knowledge into separate topics. Encyclopedias
    are reference works, designed to orient new readers, summarize details that might
    have previously been spread over many publications, and provide a summary of available
    information in comprehensible terms. A good encyclopedia can answer many questions,
    without replacing the sources from which it was constructed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Encyclopedias are examples of *tertiary sources*. They are neither primary sources,
    such as historical documents, nor are they secondary sources, such as textbooks,
    which usually discuss, report on, or interpret primary sources. Instead, an encyclopedia's
    compilers have gathered and summarized available secondary sources (often noting
    primary sources as well) to report on a field of knowledge and current thinking
    at that particular time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The encyclopedia has venerable origins. Early examples exist in manuscript form
    in cultures around the world, and bound encyclopedias have been around almost
    as long as there have been books at all. Pliny's enormous *Historia naturalis*,
    written in 77 AD, is often cited as one of the first encyclopedias; this work
    was influential for at least 1,500 years. Some of the other very first encyclopedias
    were written in Chinese (the now-lost *Huang Ian*, published around 220 AD) and
    Arabic (the 10-volume *Kitāb 'Uyūn al-Akhbār*, or *Adab al-Kitāb*, compiled around
    880 AD). Throughout the medieval era in Europe, other encyclopedic works were
    developed, many written in Latin and based around philosophical and religious
    ideas.

    "enkyklia paideia"), literally, a "[well-]rounded education," meaning "a general
    knowledge." Though the notion of a compendium of knowledge dates back thousands
    of years, the term was first used in 1541 in the title of a book by Joachimus
    Fortius Ringelbergius, *Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia* (Basel,
    1541). The word *encyclopaedia* was first used as a noun by the encyclopedist
    Pavao Skalic in the title of his book, *Encyclopaedia seu orbis disciplinarum
    tam sacrarum quam prophanarum epistemon* (Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World
    of Disciplines, Basel, 1559). (From [[Encyclopedia]], April 2007)

    existed since at least the second century AD.) An encyclopedia in the contemporary
    sense may illustrate objects, map places, contain articles about history, geography,
    science, and biography, and cover the spectrum of factual knowledge.

    topics important to their audience with limited space and editorial capacity.
    Generalist encyclopedias aim to be universal in scope, while being compact enough
    to be fully updated every few decades and to fit on a bookshelf. Specialist encyclopedias
    can fill a similar amount of space for one field or subfield. A general children's
    encyclopedia such as *World Book* is written with a different format and goals
    than a scientific encyclopedia, but both provide clear introductions to topics.

    computer code. In 2000, Stallman created the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL).
    The GFDL was conceived of as a complementary license to the GPL but was intended
    for written works such as software documentation rather than code. Wikipedia adopted
    the GFDL early on as its license for all content created on the site—a move that
    guarantees the site's content will remain perpetually free for everyone to use
    and redistribute.

    Both the software on which Wikipedia runs (MediaWiki) and the site''s content
    are freely available for use by anyone to adapt and modify, qualified only by
    the requirements of their respective GPL and GFDL licenses. Wikipedia''s slogan
    is *Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*. No one has to pay to view Wikipedia articles,
    but *free* means more than that: Free also means "no strings attached," and this
    is the consistent goal of the Wikimedia projects. Freedom means free of cost,
    free of restrictions to change and modify any content, free to redistribute, free
    for anyone to participate, and free of commercial influences.^([[8](#ftn.CHP-2-FNOTE-7)])
    The GFDL license specifies that any work placed under it may be legally reused
    and republished by anyone, with the only restriction being that any such republishing
    must itself also be licensed under the GFDL (and the original authors must be
    credited). In other words, the license ensures that any GFDL-licensed content
    is both freely available and open to all. Though contributors to Wikipedia *do*
    retain the copyrights to their work, they lose the right to specify what can be
    done with it.'

    that link to each other through their page titles and can be edited online by
    contributors without special permissions. More technically, a wiki is a kind of

    a key feature of most wikis as well. You don't need much technical knowledge or
    special permission to edit most wiki pages; instead, you can change them as you
    see fit. Wiki pages contrast with conventional web pages that have largely static

    website under a free-content license, built from contributed articles. Its model
    was more conventional, though; it was not a wiki, and contributors were expected
    to be experts in their fields. The pieces they submitted would only be published

    both in the very high use of the site and in the well-developed global community
    of dedicated volunteers that produce Wikipedia. However, Wikipedia is unfinished
    and far from being perfect, and this is reflected in the press about the site.
    Outside news stories about the site are often not "good news" about more free
    content. The media shows a greater interest in the "bad news" about the site's
    failings, which means many people first hear about Wikipedia in critical commentaries,
    usually about inaccuracies.

    group of Wikipedia editors who check new articles as they are created. An anonymous
    hoaxer inserted a short fabricated biography, just five sentences, in the article
    covering John Seigenthaler, Sr., a distinguished American journalist who had served
    in the Justice Department of the Kennedy White House. The text suggested that
    Seigenthaler was connected to the Kennedy assassinations. No one noticed for five
    months—until September 2005 when the prank was revealed and made headlines.
  prefs: []

    who in turn contacted Jimmy Wales to complain. The objectionable content was deleted
    from the live page almost immediately after being noticed, by September 24, 2005;
    in early October, the article was then deleted altogether so the objectionable
    version could not be viewed from the page history (an accurate biography was subsequently
    re-created). Because Wikipedia content is mirrored on other sites, Seigenthaler
    also had to request his biography be removed at some of these sites, such as [Answers.com](http://Answers.com)
    and [Reference.com](http://Reference.com).

    talks about his "Internet character assassination," damns the "poison-pen intellects"
    loose on the Internet, and calls Wikipedia a flawed research tool. This sparked

    news story of the vandalized Seigenthaler biography brought home the point that
    Wikipedia was now prominent enough that the accuracy of an article *mattered*—defamatory
    or inaccurate content really could harm individuals. Before the Seigenthaler scandal,
    Wikipedia contributors tended to accept that some incorrect content was on the
    site and held to the philosophy of "so fix it." This idea, which is still a core
    part of Wikipedia's basic philosophy, holds that on an open wiki where anyone
    can contribute, anyone who spots something wrong can—and should—also fix it themselves.
    The Seigenthaler incident prompted an intense effort to write more accurately
    sourced articles, to institute a zero-tolerance environment for nonsense, and
    to recognize that people who have no desire to work on the site themselves may
    be affected by Wikipedia articles.

    attendant with the tremendous growth Wikipedia experienced at the end of 2005\.
    One development was the policy on biographies of living people ([[Wikipedia:Biographies
    of living persons]], shortcut WP:BLP). This policy holds such biographies to strict
    compliance with Verifiability and No Original Research and discusses how to maintain
    the Neutral Point of View policy when dealing with negative and irrelevant information
    or information that is out of balance with the rest of the article. Violating
    this policy by inserting gossip or defamatory content is very serious; the article
    or the revision in question may be deleted, and ongoing violations may lead to
    an editor being blocked from editing. To deal with article complaints, Wikipedia
    also set up an email address and answering mechanism staffed by trusted volunteers.

    of nonsense pages being created, pages that site administrators had to delete,
    which had become a huge amount of work—on the order of thousands of pages a day.
    Some question whether this measure is effective, and in the future, Wikipedia
    may experiment with turning anonymous article creation back on to see how much
    of a difference it makes.

    treat such requests carefully, however. They consider the issue of neutrality

    an essay by paraphrasing Wikipedia is not acceptable, and of course copying Wikipedia

    review can be brought up on the discussion page, even though it would be misplaced
    in the article itself. However, discussion alone sometimes can't solve conflicts
    involving questions of expertise, as shown in the following case studies. If the

    sanctions consisted of a *revert parole*—he could only undo one change a day made

    were later reconsidered and dropped. Throughout the case, Connolley's qualifications

    for representing all major points of view when the matter in question was scientific.
    This ruling by the Arbitration Committee went more clearly with mainstream science;
    the scientific consensus is expected to predominate in scientific articles. The
    relevant principle read, "Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, a fundamental policy,

    of his students) in theoretical computer science and some other areas such as
    quantum mechanics and the sociology of science. The issue here is not the demarcation
    of the academic and non-academic approaches, but rather that Wikipedia articles,
    as surveys of academic literature, must not give undue weight to one approach.
    One affected area was logic programming, the basic technology of the "fifth generation
    computing" project. Here Hewitt overstepped the policy on No Original Research,
    attempting to impose his own definition of the field in the article.^([[15](#ftn.CHP-2-FNOTE-14)])

    apply to everyone else on the site. These cases differ, however. Hewitt's approach
    violated the letter and spirit of Neutral Point of View, clearly causing a conflict
    of interest. Experts are not immune to human failings and passion. Connolley's
    problems with troublesome non-experts were short-lived because of his patience
    with the sanctions and with other editors; his substantiation of his own contributions
    was never an issue. A neutral point of view is simply not negotiable on Wikipedia,

    materials are the most desirable sources for articles on the site. Refer to the
    mission to clarify what the goal actually is. Wikipedia is building a huge compilation
    of materials and facts, many of which come from traditional sources, with the

    or a new site could improve Wikipedia''s basic model. This idea is not impractical:
    The GFDL license and open ethos of Wikipedia explicitly encourage some kind of
    sequel to the site. And why shouldn''t there be two tertiary sources for the planet,
    or even more? The future is wide open.'

- en: 'On March 15, 2007, a landmark was reached when the word *wiki* entered the
    Oxford English Dictionary Online, after the technology had existed for just under
    12 years. Wikipedia''s heritage stretches much further back, though, to the many
    early encyclopedia and knowledge-gathering projects of the ancient world and the
    impetus to understand the world during the Enlightenment era. In more recent times,
    the technological developments of the personal computer and the Internet made
    both wikis and Wikipedia possible, and the free software movement provided Wikipedia
    with its philosophical stance. This rich history has helped define Wikipedia''s
    goals to provide free information to everyone in the world in their own language
    and to do so in a transparent, collaborative, dynamic, and open manner. Free software
    has also given Wikipedia its content license: the GFDL, which ensures that content
    will remain open, accessible, and freely reusable by anyone. These goals have
    been a part of Wikipedia since the site''s beginnings in 2001\. For all its idealism,
    however, the site has certainly not been immune to criticism of both the model
    itself and the implementation; in this chapter, we presented some case studies
    illustrating these criticisms.'
