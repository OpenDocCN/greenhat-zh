      should not ignore your relationship with teams outside of engineering.
      Even if you have the best engineering team working with you, you will
      not succeed if you have poor relationships with marketing, sales, your
      boss, or your peers. Building these relationships helps ensure your
      success—and it can be a lot of fun, as well.</p></div></div>
<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="working_with_your_company"/>Chapter 9. WORKING WITH YOUR COMPANY</h1></div></div></div><p>Since a company's practices, culture, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0544"/>and values set the tone for interactions within the
      organization, a development manager's success depends on her ability to
      work effectively within the company's culture and also her ability to
      influence it. Conversely, a manager whose style is contrary to company
      culture and practices will encounter friction with other managers and
      other employees.</p><p>To understand a company's culture and practices, the new manager
      must first inquire about it and then observe what behaviors actually
      occur in the workplace. If you focus on the following five areas, you
      can develop a good sense of your company's culture and practices:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Ask how decisions are made.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Observe how people reach agreements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Understand how meetings are conducted.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Know how people problems are resolved.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>See what behaviors get rewarded.</p></li></ul></div><p>As a manager, you can also influence your company's culture and
      practices by actively <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0545"/>promoting new practices among fellow managers and modeling
      appropriate examples. Cultures and practices can shift in small
      companies as they grow and develop, providing opportunities for change
      and improvement. If your CEO wants to improve corporate culture, your
      influence can motivate changes as the company grows.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="company_culture_and_practices"/>Company Culture and Practices</h1></div></div></div><p>Company <span class="emphasis"><em>culture</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>practices</em></span> refer to the shared <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0546"/>understanding of how employees behave in a company and
        how they interact with one another and with management. A growing
        company's culture helps define the company and makes it unique. If a
        culture is easily identifiable and projects itself in a positive
        light, prospective employees will be attracted to the company and
        current employees will be more likely to stay with the firm. From a
        purely financial standpoint, a positive culture adds value to a
        company. From a people standpoint, a positive culture makes working
        for the company an enjoyable experience.</p><p>In a small growing company, a culture can form on its own,
        without any particular guidance from employees or management. However,
        this often results in a culture that reflects the values and practices
        of top management, whether explicit or not. Company culture reflects
        what management rewards and encourages in employee behavior, and
        employees usually follow management's lead or decide to leave.</p><p>You want first and foremost to promote a culture of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0547"/>trust and collaboration, in which individuals are
        encouraged to share information and perform at a high level with the
        expectation that management will support them in their endeavors. If
        employees know that they will be treated fairly and they feel secure
        about their jobs, a culture of trust grows. Employees don't worry
        about losing their jobs for political reasons. When conflicts occur,
        employees handle their problems first with the individuals involved
        and not through email blasts to management.</p><p>More important, in a healthy culture, the overall focus is on
        company success, rather than individual success. Employees are willing
        to take reasonable risks <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0548"/>and stretch their abilities on a project because doing
        so is in everyone's best interest. Also of benefit is a focus on
        long-term as well as short-term efforts. A long-term investment in
        productivity at the expense of short-term results might make sense,
        but that approach won't work in an environment that lacks <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0549"/>trust.</p><p>Contrast a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0550"/>culture of trust with a culture of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>distrust</em></span>: Employees greet mistakes and failures
        by blaming others, politics are prevalent, and management fires people
        for reasons other than performance and finances. Employees work to
        pull themselves up by pushing others down. Their behaviors are driven
        by the fear of losing their jobs because they have seen it happen to
        others. They focus their efforts on never failing, and they don't take
        reasonable risks if those risks could lead to failure. In a culture of
        distrust, management punishes people for making mistakes.</p><p>Knowing a company's culture before accepting a job there will
        protect you from a major mismatch down the line. Unfortunately,
        companies do not always characterize themselves clearly during
        interviews. Getting an accurate picture of a company's culture can
        require that you work there for a while if you aren't able to get
        details from a person you trust.</p><p>To encourage a positive culture in your team and your company,
        think about how you interact with members of your team, and make sure
        you are building positive relationships with them. If you support a
        culture based on trust and collaboration, your team will be stronger
        and will benefit from higher productivity, your company will retain
        the best employees, and everyone will be happier.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="corporate_style"/>Corporate Style</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Corporate style</em></span> concerns the general
          manner in which employees interact with one another. Interaction
          styles vary across companies and sometimes across departments in
          larger companies. Styles of interactions you might experience
          include highly confrontational, highly political, low
          confrontational but aggressive (passive-aggressive), and highly
          collaborative. Some companies encourage confrontation for all issues
          and have resolution methods or processes in place. Others encourage
          collaboration and almost no confrontation.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0551"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0552"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e7619"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="management_style"/>Management Style</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Management style</em></span> is a subset of corporate
          culture. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0553"/>Management styles vary considerably from <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0554"/>company to company, not to mention from boss to boss.
          It usually boils down to how management makes decisions and who in
          management makes the decisions. Some managers focus on details,
          while others focus on the big picture. <span class="emphasis"><em>Detail
          managers</em></span> focus on knowing every detail of the staff
          members' activities. In contrast, <span class="emphasis"><em>big picture
          managers</em></span> keep their eye on the overview and do not want
          to know details. It's also common to see <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0555"/>strict hierarchical management and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0556"/>diffused decision-making management. A
          <span class="emphasis"><em>strict hierarchical manager</em></span> focuses on giving
          directions to people and making most decisions higher in the
          management chain. With <span class="emphasis"><em>diffused decision-making
          management</em></span>, managers allow team members to make most of
          the decisions.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0557"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0558"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0559"/></p><p>CEOs often hire managers and staff whose styles and values are
          similar to their own. This does not necessarily result in uniformity
          of management style, but a CEO can effectively create a
          consensus-type management style. That style tends to propagate down
          in a growing organization because of the continuous hiring
          requirements in a small company.</p><p>Knowing the management style will allow you to understand how
          best to drive forward your ideas and important efforts. Matching
          your interaction style with that of the company will lead to greater
          success. However, if you are not comfortable with your company's
          style, do not try to emulate it. A significant mismatch in style can
          be a good reason to look elsewhere for a new position. As you
          consider a new employer, look carefully at the corporate culture and
          management style before accepting a position.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="meeting_style"/>Meeting Style</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Meeting style</em></span> refers to the way teams of
          people organize their discussions and decision processes. Small
          company management typically does not define meeting style, which
          tends to evolve as the company grows.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0560"/></p><p>When a company is tiny, with 12 or fewer employees, all of the
          employees communicate continually and most are up to date with
          events, agendas, and important decisions made by the company.
          Conversations are <span class="emphasis"><em>informal</em></span> with few preset
          meeting times, agendas, or lists of invitees, while <span class="emphasis"><em>formal
          meetings</em></span> are usually rare or nonexistent.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0561"/></p><p>As a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0562"/>company grows to about 50 employees, it transitions to
          a point at which formal <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0563"/>meetings seem to develop a life of their own. The
          number of potential two-way conversations increases
          exponentially—so, for example, a company of 5 people has 10
          different two-way conversations possible, but a company of 50 people
          has more than 1,000 different two-way conversations possible. As a
          company grows, it becomes impossible for every employee to know
          every other employee well—which was possible when the company was
          still tiny in size.</p><p>Company management usually responds to growth by
          <span class="emphasis"><em>compartmentalizing</em></span> functions. This ensures that
          not everyone needs to talk to everyone else in the company. Most
          employees communicate with people who work in their functional area
          and in some restricted way to people in other teams.</p><p>Invariably, the transition from a tiny company to a small
          growing company results in an explosion of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0564"/>meetings. Many small companies develop a culture of
          too many formal meetings: Management sets up regularly scheduled
          status meetings, one-on-one meetings, company meetings, technology
          meetings, and team meetings. With so many meetings to attend, a
          manager has little time to do his work or interact with his teams.
          If more than half of each day is devoted to meetings, the only way a
          manager can interact with his team members is to … <span class="emphasis"><em>set up
          a meeting</em></span>.</p><p>Formal meetings are not a bad thing, unless too many meetings
          are scheduled. They are not always an effective use of people's time
          and can slow down progress in a growing company. Many bad practices
          are brought into meetings by people who missed meeting training.
          Many formal meetings are a waste of people's time because too many
          participants attend, no agenda is offered, no conclusions are
          reached, no action items are recorded, meeting members are allowed
          to pontificate, and meetings are scheduled when an email or hallway
          conversation would be more effective.</p><p>A management day chock-full of formal meetings leaves little
          time for other activities such as getting your work done, talking
          with team members at their desks, impromptu hallway conversations,
          and problem solving. Spending the day running from meeting to
          meeting also drains your enthusiasm. You might respond to excessive
          formal meetings by spending your nights getting your own work done,
          not getting key work done, skipping meetings without explanation,
          pushing back on meetings, and blocking out time on your schedule so
          that you can't be added to another meeting roster.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="meetings_all_day_long"/><p class="title"><b>MEETINGS ALL DAY LONG</b></p><p>As a mid-level manager at a large software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0565"/>company, my time is not my own. We use Microsoft
            Outlook and Exchange so that anyone can set up a meeting and send
            you a request. Every day, my schedule gets booked solid with
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0566"/>meetings. Many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0567"/>meetings are regularly scheduled. The other
            irregular meetings fill in the gaps. If people see a break in my
            schedule, they fill it in.</p><p>I get frustrated, as I do not have time to think or do my
            own work except in the evening after 5 PM. Sometimes people insist
            on meetings from 5 to 6 PM as that time is the only slot available
            on my calendar. I am frustrated that my time is not under my
            control.</p><p>—Manager at a large company</p></div><p>To reduce excessive company meetings, you will need to discuss
          and advocate for the changes to gain the support of your boss and
          peers. The CEO and other managers might have open ears to
          suggestions about improving efficiency, because, like you, they
          probably have too many meetings crammed into too little time. You
          can also collaborate and share ideas with peer managers about how to
          make meetings more efficient. Actively define best practices for
          meetings to keep them from becoming the dominant time-waster of
          everyone's day. Illustrating best practices in the meetings you
          chair can influence others as well. In all cases, avoid lecturing
          others about poor practices.</p><p>Solving the "too many formal meetings" problem requires
          collective cultural action. An "all-day meeting" culture might
          survive in a large company, but in a small growing company, this
          culture saps employee vitality.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e7767"/></p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="effective_meetings"/>Effective Meetings</h3></div></div></div><p>Creating an effective meeting culture can require a shift in
            company practices as the company grows. Your company should
            provide annual training for employees on running effective
            meetings. A good course will cover how to run an efficient and
            useful meeting, how to choose attendees, and when to use other
            means of communication instead of calling a meeting. If management
            properly calibrates employees' attitudes, employees will respond
            honestly if you ask whether a meeting is necessary.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0568"/></p><p>Several general principles can be followed in setting up a
            meeting:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span>Define a clear purpose</span>.
              Define a purpose and the desired results before calling the
              meeting. In the purpose definition, include your thoughts about
              the results of the meeting and define the type of meeting you
              seek. Common meeting types are information <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0569"/>presentation, data-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0570"/>collection, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0571"/>decision-making. At an <span class="emphasis"><em>information
              presentation meeting</em></span>, you present information you
              want the attendees to know. At a <span class="emphasis"><em>data-collection
              meeting</em></span>, you try to collect information about a
              problem as a group. At a <span class="emphasis"><em>decision-making
              meeting</em></span>, you discuss a problem and come to a decision
              about how to handle it.</p><p><span>Choose attendees</span>. Choose
              the minimum number of attendees, limiting the list only to those
              who can contribute. You can inform others later of information
              they need to know in an email or in meeting minutes.</p><p><span>Create an agenda</span>. Before
              the meeting, define and distribute an agenda that describes the
              main points you want to discuss so that people come
              prepared.</p><p><span>Distribute clear
              invitations</span>. Define a location, date, and time for the
              meeting and let people know these details well in advance. Make
              sure that they consent to their participation, and do not assume
              their availability.</p><p><span>Start on time</span>. Encourage a
              culture of starting <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0572"/>meetings on time or no more than five minutes
              late, even if some of the participants are not present when the
              meeting starts. This will avoid wasting time waiting for tardy
              participants. If meetings always seem to start late, attendees
              will show up late.</p><p><span>Leave gaps in the schedule</span>.
              It is difficult to start a meeting on time when it is scheduled
              back-to-back with other meetings. Leave a 15- or 30-minute gap
              between your meeting and the last meeting on each participant's
              calendar whenever possible. This will allow everyone a short but
              much-needed break and avoid delays in starting your
              meeting.</p></blockquote></div><p>Follow these general principles for running an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0573"/>effective meeting:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Designate a moderator to run the meeting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Designate someone to capture information and keep
                minutes as needed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stick to the agenda. If meeting members stray to other
                topics, stop the discussion for a moment. Agree on a place in
                the agenda to discuss new items or whether attendees should
                discuss new items in another meeting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Manage the meeting time as you discuss topics. Large
                <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0574"/>meetings are expensive for small firms. Consider
                the cost of the meeting time, preparation time, and the
                inefficiencies of breaking up people's days with another
                meeting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The meeting can cover the statuses of earlier action
                items. For ad hoc meetings, assign a "customer" for the action
                item who will follow the item and judge its success. This will
                often be you by default, but it doesn't need to be.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the end of the meeting, review action items and
                ensure that they are recorded in an identified location. A
                standard location can be used for distributing meeting
                minutes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>After the meeting, ask participants about the value of
                the meeting so that you can make improvements for the next
                meeting. Do not take suggestions personally.</p></li></ul></div><p>Learning how to be effective at meetings takes repeated
            training and effort. Time spent on this effort will pay off in
            improved productivity and morale. Employees do not find work
            rewarding when they can't do their jobs because they must attend
            too many meetings.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e7880"/></p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="handling_interteam_problems"/>Handling Interteam Problems</h1></div></div></div><p>As a small company grows, the CEO forms functional teams headed
        by different managers. As the teams grow larger, the feeling of
        camaraderie can shrink and competition and conflict can grow, making
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0575"/>interteam problem-solving more difficult. If a
        problem-handling strategy is not in place, people will push problems
        up to the executive team, who will push them back down again after
        making a decision.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0576"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0577"/></p><p>As the company grows, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0578"/>problem resolution can consume huge amounts of executive
        time. In the process, executives can become micromanagers who are
        constantly resolving conflicts. A corporate approach to problem
        resolution can help.</p><p>When workers are reluctant to tackle issues with fellow
        employees in other functional areas, they will try resolving issues
        through <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0579"/>email exchanges. For difficult issues, some find it
        easier to offer long responses to emails rather than talking through
        the problem with another individual. They believe the problem is off
        radar once they have sent their email responses, so they can go on
        working. Here's a good rule of thumb regarding this type of
        conversation: If you are on the third email in an inconclusive problem
        discussion chain, talk to the person face to face or call him or her
        on the telephone instead of continuing the email
        correspondence.</p><p>One rapidly growing company, for example, had a prevalent
        tendency to bounce problems to the top and back down, and it was
        getting worse as the company grew. Fortunately, the executive team
        recognized the problem and took action by training people on a new
        approach that looked like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Work directly with people in other groups to resolve the
            problem. Ask for their help in solving the problem rather than
            demanding a specific resolution.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the problem cannot be resolved, meet with the other team
            member's boss and invite the other team member to join.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the issue still cannot be resolved, you can meet with the
            boss's manager and invite your own manager.</p></li></ol></div><p>The goal of this approach is to encourage employees to resolve
        the problems as close to the source of knowledge without involving top
        management, and it's effective if management regularly trains
        employees in how to do it. It does require a shift in thinking on the
        part of staff about dealing with problems cooperatively and not
        treating other employees as the problem.</p><p>Advise your staff that when trying to resolve a difficult
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0580"/>problem with another person, the focus should be shifted
        from the other person to the actual problem itself. One way to do this
        is to shift physical positions, from each party directly facing each
        other to both facing a whiteboard with the problem written on it. The
        change can shift the relationship from confrontational to the two
        parties viewing the problem as something about which they can
        brainstorm and jointly solve.</p><p>As your company grows, actively encourage your team and others
        to work through problems directly with other teams. If your company
        has developed a culture of trust, workers will come to discussions not
        trying to enforce demands, but rather looking for the best joint
        solutions to any problem. Talking one-on-one with difficult co-workers
        can be a trying experience short term, but it will improve everyone's
        work environment in the longer term.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="growing_peer_relationships"/>Growing Peer Relationships</h1></div></div></div><p>Build relationships with your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0581"/>peers and you build influence within your company as it
        grows. You should develop a <span class="emphasis"><em>peer relationship</em></span>
        with co-workers who are not your direct boss or your direct
        subordinates, such as other managers on the executive team and staff
        workers in different departments such as human resources, finance,
        marketing, QA, and customer service.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0582"/></p><p>You can benefit from getting to know people you do not normally
        see daily. Workers from other departments can offer insights into
        problems faced in their teams, which can help you better understand
        how to modify your work to improve the quality of the overall effort.
        It can also lead to your helping other teams with their problems.
        Understanding others' problems can yield better insights into selling,
        serving, supporting, and upgrading your customers, and it could
        provide opportunities for you to suggest solutions for internal
        improvements that increase the bonus pool or even keep the company
        (and your job) alive. Delivering value to internal departments outside
        of your primary responsibilities also builds trust and respect within
        the company.</p><p>Strong <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0583"/>peer relationships also benefit your team, because your
        relationships with other managers will encourage cooperative behavior
        between the teams. For example, say you have created a good
        relationship with the marketing team manager and the two teams are
        aware of this; if a technical writer on the marketing team needs
        information from an engineer, the engineer will likely provide the
        information directly to the writer instead of claiming he's too busy
        and forcing the task on you, his manager.</p><p>Good <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0584"/>peer relationships can also decrease the political
        maneuvering in a company. Political mischief increases in companies
        whose employees build walls between groups. One team can find it
        easier to criticize another team if the two teams have not developed a
        working and trusting relationship. When more direct relationships are
        established, politics are reduced.</p><p>You can encourage <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0585"/>peer relationships by staying behind after meetings and
        initiating conversations with others about the meeting or about other
        topics, if you or they don't feel pressed for time. Post-meeting
        discussions can be informal chats about work problems, an opportunity
        to share opinions on important work topics, or even a chance to
        converse about non-work–related issues.</p><p>Another approach that can improve <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0586"/>peer relationships is asking for help with general
        management or personnel problems—both good topics to discuss with
        another manager, as long as they do not involve confidential
        information about an employee. Asking a peer manager for advice shows
        that you respect his or her abilities and trust his or her discretion,
        and it can lead to good discussions and valuable advice. But don't
        invent a problem or ask for advice if you have already decided on a
        solution.</p><p>If you are not in the habit of talking to a wide range of peers,
        it can take some directed effort to reach out to people you don't know
        and talk to daily. Spending time walking around and talking with
        people, as opportunity permits, or inviting peers out for lunch or
        coffee provides a less formal setting for conversation. Less formal
        settings allow you to get to know your peers as people, not just as
        corporate entities.</p><p>In addition to the benefits it provides to your team and
        company, getting to know others is fun. Talking to people in different
        areas can provide a broad perspective on how your company works. If
        you are sincere in your desire to get to know your peers as people, it
        will show. Make an effort to talk with others, and do not treat
        interactions as a work obligation. Focus on the positive attitude that
        can come from getting to know new people.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="engineering_team_respect"/>Engineering Team Respect</h1></div></div></div><p>One remaining aspect of company culture is identifying which
        team's efforts are particularly emphasized and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0587"/>respected. Each small company holds a unique view of its
        software development team. Some departments view development as a key
        company resource and give the team commensurate respect, authority,
        equipment, space, and flexibility. Management usually treats engineers
        in startups as heroes, while their development efforts produce the
        initial products for the marketplace.</p><p>As the company grows, a management shift in attitude toward
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0588"/>engineering can occur. This shift happens because sales
        or marketing teams become key drivers of new revenue after development
        has created the product. When this happens, management does not view
        the development team as the most important source of innovation and
        value. Instead, management views development as part of a production
        organization and as a corporate cost. This shift can lead to team
        dissatisfaction as engineers see their status diminished.</p><p>Management sometimes even considers development engineers as the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>cause</em></span> of company problems, such as poor quality
        products, dissatisfied customers, and slow software releases. These
        issues can be the result of improperly built software during the
        startup phase, however.</p><p>If senior management treats engineering as merely another
        corporate expense, you need to advocate for your team. Base the
        advocacy on real team successes and potential for the future. As you
        advocate, acknowledge past problems and explain improvements that will
        prevent them from being repeated. Development teams can be drivers of
        innovation and profitability, not just sources of order
        fulfillment.</p><p>Spend time at senior staff meetings describing ideas collected
        from your team to demonstrate the value of developers to the company.
        Describing team accomplishments at a company meeting is another great
        approach. Keep up to date on changing company needs, including those
        driven by the market, because you can use this information to propose
        revisions to your product roadmap. You can also promote your team by
        asking developers to help solve problems for other
        departments—sometimes small efforts by development can be of
        tremendous help to another group.</p></div>

<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="working_with_the_ceo_and_the_executive_t"/>Chapter 10. WORKING WITH THE CEO AND THE EXECUTIVE TEAM</h1></div></div></div><p>When you're asked to lead a development team in a small company,
      your new relationship with the CEO and other members of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0589"/>executive team can be one of your largest and most
      unsettling adjustments. The CEO is your boss, your peers are the
      executive team, and you aren't in Kansas anymore. You are accountable
      for the entire company's technical practices and how the development
      team's software affects business. You no longer define success based on
      your technical capabilities alone. You need good people skills and the
      proper attitude to be successful in your new role.</p><p>Decisions made at the executive level differ from many of those
      made at lower levels in a company. They are based on the company's
      business needs and focus on a management perspective, not on superiority
      of one technology over another. Consequently, you will need to
      understand the business aspects of your decisions and incorporate the
      opinions and knowledge of other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0590"/>executive team members as you make those decisions.</p><p>The information in this chapter will be helpful for a senior
      technologist who is serving on an executive team for the first
      time.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="supporting_your_boss"/>Supporting Your Boss</h1></div></div></div><p>Your job as the development manager in a small company differs
        from a management position in a large company, because you are
        probably kept accountable by the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0591"/>CEO and other executives in the company. You are in
        charge of software engineers who report to you, but you must also
        report to your boss at the top.</p><p>Knowing your boss's background will provide some insight into
        his or her management style and priorities. In any business,
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0592"/>CEOs and presidents tend to focus on areas in which they
        have the most expertise. CEOs with a sales background, for example,
        may focus on company sales and have a shorter-term focus. CEOs with a
        technology background may dig into the technology, sometimes
        overemphasizing its importance over market and customers. CEOs with a
        marketing background may value the product and market, not always
        pulling together the operational pieces. By understanding your boss's
        background, you can determine the best ways to provide him or her with
        information as well as how to make a winning business case for efforts
        you want to undertake. So, for example, with a finance-focused CEO,
        you could make the case for the revenue benefits of your efforts; with
        an operations-focused CEO, you could emphasize productivity; and with
        a marketing-focused CEO, you could spotlight the market penetration
        benefits.</p><p>Your relationship with your boss can also define how the company
        perceives your efforts and those of your team. When your team does
        good work, you need to promote these successes. Your boss's perception
        of your performance influences how she directs you and how successful
        you will be as a leader. A little <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0593"/>self-promotion can help you and your team gain respect,
        improve your boss's confidence and trust in you and your abilities,
        and help your boss and the company be confident of your team's
        contributions. Remember that a little <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0594"/>self-promotion goes a long way: Avoid excessively
        promoting or bragging about your accomplishments.</p><p>A strong relationship <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0595"/>with your boss based on mutual <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0596"/>trust will also improve your effectiveness: When your
        boss trusts you, your recommendations will carry more weight and your
        decisions will be met with fewer roadblocks. On the other hand, when
        you trust your boss, you are better able to support her decisions,
        because she will have considered your input along with the needs of
        the company as a whole.</p><p>You earn the trust of your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0597"/>CEO by supporting her leadership. You act in the
        interest of the company and not just yourself; you support the rest of
        the executive team; you don't reveal confidences to make a convenient
        point; and you follow through with your commitments. If you gain your
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0598"/>boss's trust, she will give you more responsibility and
        share more information with you.</p><p>Act professionally and responsibly with your boss, as you would
        want your direct reports to act toward you. Avoid the pitfalls of not
        being responsive, thinking you know better, not fully supporting or
        criticizing her efforts, and not providing information she needs. A
        positive approach can build a strong foundation of trust with your
        CEO.</p><p>Let's consider several areas of interaction in more detail:
        clarity of goals, timely information, communication, and decision
        making.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ensuring_clarity_of_goals"/>Ensuring Clarity of Goals</h2></div></div></div><p>Your boss undoubtedly has goals in mind for the development
          team and probably made these known to you when you began your
          position in management. You may think you understand each of these
          goals, but you can make sure by repeating them back to her in your
          own words. It's critical that you understand her perspectives from
          the beginning and that you meet with her periodically to determine
          whether goals have changed.</p><p>Ask your boss to describe her expectations of you and your
          team as well as broad and specific long- and short-term goals. Goals
          should not be viewed merely as a to-do list, but as a vision of
          success that can help you create a mental picture of what you need
          to achieve and why. As you discuss these goals, work with your boss
          to define them in a way that is both sensible and achievable. After
          you have spent some time reviewing the goals, discuss problems
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0599"/>or questions to be sure you understand each
          completely—blindly charging ahead <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0600"/>without fully <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0601"/>understanding what is expected of you can lead to many
          wrong turns and will ultimately hurt your team and the company. Work
          with your boss to ensure that each goal will benefit the company and
          your team in the long term.</p><p>Goals should be set up and reviewed regularly—ideally, every
          quarter. Reviewing quarterly goals with your boss allows for larger
          tasks to be divided into short-term goals that can be achieved by
          the end of each quarter. Yearly goals, on the other hand, are often
          too broad and can miss the mark, because the needs of a business
          often change throughout the year. What was crucial at the beginning
          of the year may seem unimportant by the end of the year. If your
          boss doesn't require that you set quarterly goals, take the
          initiative and propose them.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="providing_useful_information"/>Providing Useful Information</h2></div></div></div><p>Provide your boss with the right information at the right
          time. Consider what types and the amounts of information are most
          appropriate to provide as you discuss results, status, outstanding
          issues, risks, and staff. Instead of providing too many unnecessary
          details, summarize information regarding schedules, technology, and
          staff issues. Regularly provide a summary document showing project
          status. Summarize technology issues using business terms—cost, time,
          trade-offs, and risks—rather than complex technological terms,
          unless she asks for those details. A high-level summary of staff
          issues works best. Avoid discussing details of individual workers'
          personal issues unless they could seriously affect the
          company.</p><p>When reporting information, consider your boss's background,
          style, and priorities. If your boss has an analytical bent, she may
          prefer more data as well as the source of data. If she's a
          big-picture person, she may want to see only a high-level summary of
          project progress. Your reporting should focus first on your boss's
          priorities; then you can cover your topics. If, for example, your
          boss's top priority is releasing a particular feature, she will want
          to hear about that first.</p><p>Your boss needs to be presented regularly with useful
          information, but she doesn't want to wait to be surprised by big
          issues that can affect business. Don't wait to inform your boss
          about large, important issues. No manager likes to hear about a
          significant problem late in the game, when there is little time to
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0602"/>correct the situation.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="communicating"/>Communicating</h2></div></div></div><p>If you do not make a point of communicating regularly
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0603"/>with your boss, you will miss opportunities to provide
          and receive critical information. Do not assume that your boss
          always knows exactly what you do.</p><p>To communicate effectively with your boss, learn her
          communication style—every boss has a unique one. Some will set up
          regular meetings and encourage drop-by sessions. Others will stay in
          their offices and talk with you only at assigned one-on-one
          meetings. Others will walk around to see firsthand how work is
          going.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="when_is_a_one-on-one_not_a_one-on-one"/><p class="title"><b>WHEN IS A ONE-ON-ONE NOT A ONE-ON-ONE?</b></p><p>My boss held all of his one-on-one conversations in a group
            meeting. He required all staff to attend the meeting one afternoon
            each week. At the meeting, he would talk with each person
            individually for 20 to 30 minutes and expect everyone to listen.
            This meeting would go on for 4 hours every week.</p><p>This approach was not popular with his staff. It had all of
            the disadvantages of a group meeting and none of the advantages of
            a one-on-one meeting. People did not talk about confidential
            situations or issues they did not want to discuss with the team.
            In addition, when it was not your time to talk, you had to spend
            time listening to conversations that were not relevant. It felt to
            all like a wasted afternoon once a week.</p><p>—Engineering and IT manager</p></div><p>It's a good idea to talk with your boss in informal as well as
          in regular, formal meetings. Catch your boss late in the day for an
          impromptu conversation—this can be a great time to find out what
          your boss is thinking about key issues and to discuss problems as
          they occur.</p><p>As the head of engineering, you are tasked <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0604"/>with communicating <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0605"/>information from your boss to your team and vice
          versa. Being a megaphone for your boss is not effective—being an
          effective communicator requires filtering information so that it is
          most useful to the team. It requires that you interpret your boss's
          and executive team's goals in ways that the development team can
          understand and use and that you present appropriate information to
          your boss and other managers regarding your developers'
          needs.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="influencing_decisions"/>Influencing Decisions</h2></div></div></div><p>When an issue arises that requires the input or approval of
          your boss, describe each problem and outline what you believe to be
          the best particular approach to solve it. She may have questions,
          solution suggestions, and issues of her own to contribute. The best
          decisions can be made together after a thorough discussion.</p><p>Do not assume that your boss understands issues exactly as you
          do or that her decisions and conclusions will necessarily be the
          same as yours. Your boss will sometimes disagree with your
          approaches to solving problems as well as which problems need to be
          solved. When this happens, ask questions to try to clarify your
          understanding of your boss's perspectives to learn about outside
          factors that affect her opinion. If you and your boss still disagree
          after a discussion, suggest even more alternative approaches. A good
          boss will listen to other options and sometimes change her decision.
          More input on problems and solutions usually yields better results.
          If your boss decides to stick with her original decision, support
          her.</p><p>Never criticize your boss or her decisions to your team.
          Managing a team is a difficult task; managing a staff that does not
          support its leader's decisions can be impossible. Supporting your
          boss and her decisions will make you an effective part of an
          effective company. Not lending support to your boss will lead to
          major problems for your company, for you, and for your team.
          However, if your boss's approach goes against your core management
          or ethical convictions, you'd be wise to look for a new position.
          You'll be better off if you recognize the mismatch and move on
          rather than stay in the position.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e8233"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e8238"/></p></div></div></div>

        the senior technical person who reports to the CEO puts you on the
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0606"/>executive team, whether your title is chief technology
        officer, vice president of engineering, director, or manager.
        Consequently, you need to be prepared to handle that level of
        responsibility.</p><p>When facing an unfamiliar role as a member of the executive
        team, a new manager should concentrate on four areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0607"/>Conflict</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Confidence</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Communication</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Collaboration</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="resolving_conflict"/>Resolving Conflict</h2></div></div></div><p>Working with other senior managers requires that you be able
          to work through conflicts; however, conflicts you encounter with the
          executive team will differ from conflicts that occurred with the
          engineering team. While engineering conflicts usually focus on
          technical details and personality differences, executive team
          conflicts will be driven by executives' varying priorities,
          backgrounds, and styles. Each executive's priorities are based on
          his or her experiences and job function.</p><p>Compare, for example, the priorities of the vice presidents of
          sales, finance, marketing, and engineering. The VP of sales will
          focus on the short-term sales funnel; he may aggressively push for
          getting the next best sale, which might require that developers
          build custom features to land a prized client, even if development
          is a bit understaffed or underequipped. The VP of finance will focus
          on financial regulations, accounting, longer-term financial health,
          and keeping the cash flow positive; he may oppose the purchase of
          extra equipment, even if it will help with development. The VP of
          marketing, on the other hand, may prefer to drive the product toward
          general solutions that strengthen its position in the marketplace;
          development tools are the least of her worries. And
          <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> want your team to be able to purchase extra
          equipment to ease the development burden and focus on rapidly
          creating technically great solutions.</p><p>It can be difficult to navigate through perfectly valid but
          competing interests; however, considering the requirements of other
          departments within the company will serve you and your team well. If
          you meet with other executives to discuss their priorities and views
          of the development process, you will build rapport and make
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0608"/>conflict resolution easier. Building solid
          relationships among other executives will help each of you
          appreciate the pros and cons of proposals from each functional
          area.</p><p>On the other hand, if a fellow executive points out a problem
          with you or your team during an executive meeting, you must avoid
          becoming defensive in your response and avoid finger-pointing or
          personal attacks that force the CEO to referee. Instead, suggest
          that the two of you meet later to discuss the situation and work
          toward a solution, perhaps even proposing a specific time and place
          to meet. If a positive corporate culture exists and trust has been
          established among members of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0609"/>executive team, resolving problems brought up in
          meetings can be a constructive and professional process.</p><p>In general, don't treat conflict as a personal affront, and
          don't keep score by counting "wins" and "losses." If a conflict
          remains unresolved or is poorly resolved, everyone loses. Treat each
          challenge as an opportunity to understand other professional
          priorities, backgrounds, and styles. Set a collaborative tone so
          that you can work out conflicts quickly and effectively.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="taking_up_your_mantle_with_confidence"/>Taking up Your Mantle with Confidence</h2></div></div></div><p>As the head of software development, you won't need to look
          for conflict; it will find you. Even a cooperative team will
          encounter conflicting goals, limited resources, unfortunate events,
          misunderstandings, and individual mistakes. People react differently
          to stressful situations: Some may shift blame to another person;
          others may become angry and argue relentlessly; still others may
          become quiet and withdrawn. If you are the victim of blame or an
          angry tirade, resist the temptation to fire back and escalate a
          conflict or waffle about what can be done. Instead, treat other team
          members with respect and actively reach out to work cooperatively
          with them.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0610"/></p><p>Some executive meetings can be intense, especially when key
          decisions are being considered that can directly affect the success
          or failure of a company or its product. It is important that you
          show <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0611"/>confidence in your ability to manage yourself and your
          team while working with others in executive meetings. Sometimes
          other executives or your boss will suggest technical solutions that
          make little sense to you. Rather than meekly accepting such tasks
          without discussion, consider and offer alternatives that may help
          solve core problems. A development manager needs to be honest and be
          able to say <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> when the best answer is
          <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>. It's better to ask for more conversations
          about a request after the meeting than to acquiesce or argue during
          the meeting. On the other hand, confidence does not equal bravado or
          avoidance of responsibility. Accept responsibility for areas and
          developers under your control, and take measures to resolve issues
          that fall within your realm.</p><p>Most of all, don't mislead others by providing information
          that is inappropriate, incomplete, or untrue. If you are unsure
          about how to answer a question from another executive, don't make a
          bad impression by waffling or avoiding the question. Indicate that
          you will provide the information and specify a deadline—one to five
          days is usually appropriate for answering most information
          requests.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="opening_communication"/>Opening Communication</h2></div></div></div><p>Regular communication with members of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0612"/>executive team improves company success as well as
          others' perception of your efforts. Communication allows for
          coordination of efforts and discussion of overall company
          challenges. A lack of communication results in executives making
          assumptions about what others are doing, which leads to wasted and
          duplicated efforts. For example, sales should not be looking for
          customers for a new technical innovation if development already
          abandoned the idea without informing sales.</p><p>Communication is especially important when mistakes occur. You
          may be tempted to avoid advertising mistakes that originate in
          engineering, but exposing them early and working with other
          executives to resolve problems can yield the best results for you
          and the company. For example, if a software defect leads to a major
          problem with a client, the sales VP needs to know so he can talk to
          the client and help mitigate any damages. This approach works best
          when a culture of trust has already been established.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>How</em></span> you communicate is just as important
          as <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> is being communicated. Consider three
          common communication venues: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0613"/>executive team <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0614"/>meetings, special status reports, and individual
          conversations.</p><p>Most small companies have weekly <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0615"/>executive team meetings that tend to reflect the CEO's
          objectives and interests but usually provide opportunities for each
          team member to speak. Although the format and content vary
          considerably depending on the company and its current goals, you
          typically will be given the opportunity to summarize your team's
          activities. Use this time to highlight delivery changes, problem
          areas, and successes.</p><p>A brief summary in an executive meeting often isn't enough to
          provide thorough status information in a rapidly changing business.
          You may want to consider providing weekly one-page status summaries
          to members of the executive team. Each summary should describe
          recent results, project status information, expected delivery dates,
          and problems encountered and resolved. More important, it needs to
          be quick and easy to read and understand—both are critical for busy
          executives. Avoid low-level technical details. The report could
          include information on the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Projects in progress and completed since the previous
              report</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Next priority efforts <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0616"/>with estimated delivery schedules</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unplanned work that has arisen</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Hiring and staffing update</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Risks identified</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Positives (new ideas, happy customers, successful
              efforts)</p></li></ul></div><p>While a good communication approach during executive team
          meetings is important, talking with other executives individually
          will lay the foundation for more positive working relationships. You
          can also walk around the office and talk with other executive team
          members individually—not just about work items, but also about
          hobbies and/or other interests. Get to know their backgrounds and
          their work objectives to help you understand their perspectives.
          Look for opportunities to collaborate on joint problems, offer
          assistance, or ask for advice. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0617"/>Informal conversations are great for team building and
          discussions that are more detailed.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="collaborating_effectively"/>Collaborating Effectively</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you're engaging in strong, positive communication with
          other managers, you can improve your relationships further by
          focusing on collaboration. Collaboration at the executive team level
          is essential for solving the larger problems your company will face,
          such as how to stretch finances during tough times, major product
          failures at a customer's site, or how to deal with an unhappy
          customer. Don't wait for the CEO to ask you to work with another
          team member to resolve a problem. Build the relationships first so
          that when a problem occurs, you are already working collaboratively
          with the appropriate manager.</p><p>To solve some problems, a team or manager may be required to
          change an approach. For example, if improving the <span class="emphasis"><em>request
          for quote</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS">Chapter 11</a>) process requires that
          sales supply engineering with more information up front, your team
          gets the immediate benefit of time savings while the sales team
          incurs additional costs. However, the company as a whole will
          benefit from the changes. If you have a good working relationship
          with the sales manager, such changes will be easier to support and
          endure.</p></div></div>
<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="listening_to_your_customers"/>Chapter 11. LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS</h1></div></div></div><p>The development team's relationship with sales and customers can
      be a source <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0618"/>of inspiration—and a source <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0619"/>of frustration. It can be inspiring because great ideas
      come out of customer and sales interactions; it can be frustrating when
      communication problems lead to unnecessary work and when sales promises
      features or products before consulting with development about the
      reality of those promises. As development manager, you must always
      remember that the company's success depends on pleasing your
      customers—even if that means dealing with frustrating situations.</p><p>Although many software engineers at small companies have some
      customer exposure, most engineers do not see customer communication as a
      primary strength or personal work goal. If you are new to the head of
      engineering position, you will need to appreciate the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0620"/>importance of customer-engineering communications.</p><p>This chapter covers several considerations that can be important
      when working <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0621"/>with sales and customers: customer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0622"/>satisfaction, meetings, sales promises, requests for
      quotes, and client requests.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="customer_satisfaction"/>Customer Satisfaction</h1></div></div></div><p>Keeping customers satisfied is a necessity for a small company
        that hopes to be successful. Simply creating a great product will not
        guarantee ample sales if you and your company fail to focus on
        customer problems and requirements. Remember that buyers always have
        other options: They don't have to spend their money on your
        product.</p><p>Customer satisfaction is not just a sales and account management
        goal; it requires the efforts of the entire company, including members
        of the development team. As development manager, you are responsible
        for delivering a reliable product on time, but you also need to
        provide service to company customers during and after
        development.</p><p>By providing clients with updates of work in progress, seeking
        their opinions, and listening to their concerns, engineers can help
        instill confidence in the company and its products. Speaking with
        clients after product delivery to listen to their concerns can help
        you catch problems early before they get out of hand.</p><p>Of course, customers expect you and your company to deliver a
        working product on time, but if you know you can't meet a delivery
        commitment, you need to be honest and straightforward about the
        situation. If delivery will be late, the client needs to be informed
        of the delay as soon as possible. Early communication allows customers
        to adjust their plans and schedules for rolling out the release when
        it is easier and less expensive for them to make such
        adjustments.</p><p>Before contacting any customer directly, discuss your concerns
        with your boss and the marketing, sales, and customer support teams to
        determine the best communication approach. Marketing, sales, and
        customer support teams might believe you are undermining their efforts
        if you communicate with a client without including them in the
        discussion. Since sales and customer support are responsible for each
        specific customer relationship, let managers know what you plan to
        communicate and work out the best approach—the interaction can be a
        joint phone call, an email, a meeting, or a direct call in which you
        or another manager summarizes product problems or concerns.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="really_listening_to_an_angry_customer"/><p class="title"><b>REALLY LISTENING TO AN ANGRY CUSTOMER</b></p><p>A former boss did a great job handling a product failure. An
          older product experienced a significant failure. The customer was
          really upset and ready to stop using our product and take his
          business elsewhere.</p><p>In response, my boss listened to the customer and then
          acknowledged his concerns and our failure. He then proposed that it
          was time to get the customer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0623"/>off this older system and on to something more
          current, as the product had aged <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0624"/>with all <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0625"/>of the custom changes made to it. The customer
          responded positively and was pleased when they received the new
          version of the software at a significantly discounted price.</p><p>—Engineering manager</p></div><p>When a product or service disappoints a customer, listen
        carefully to the customer's concerns. Acknowledge the concerns and
        provide accurate information about the problem along with an
        explanation of what went wrong and how you will improve it now and in
        the future. If you can, find and present alternative solutions to the
        problem.</p><p>If a serious quality or reliability issue is discovered, a more
        in-depth response is necessary. Investigate the problem, provide an
        explanation of what happened, and outline the steps that will prevent
        the problem from reoccurring. Learn about the specific client's needs
        before preparing this information. Some prefer a cursory explanation,
        but others want to be presented with considerable detail to help them
        fully understand what happened. In some cases, you may need to discuss
        what you hope to say with company legal counsel before you contact a
        client so that you can be informed of any legal issues related to
        providing detailed explanations of problems.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="customer_meetings"/>Customer Meetings</h1></div></div></div><p>A great way to understand your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0626"/>customers is to meet <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0627"/>with them. Seek out opportunities to listen to their
        concerns firsthand and to learn how they are using the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0628"/>software. Understanding common problems and requirements
        is a crucial part of setting long-term product direction and making
        short-term improvements. Avoid the temptation to meet <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0629"/>with clients only when specifically asked to do
        so.</p><p>When a client requests a meeting with engineering, a specific
        technical goal is usually the focus. As engineering manager, you may
        be expected to discuss the product from a high-level technological
        perspective, but avoid providing too much technical detail to those
        who require only a summary. Also, always show <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0630"/>enthusiasm for the product and technology, because it
        helps build the customer relationship. An enthusiastic development
        manager builds customers' confidence in the company.</p><p>Before the meeting, learn about the client's concerns and what
        he or she hopes to gain from the meeting. Work with the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0631"/>sales team to determine which topics to cover and what
        the company's goals for the meeting are. Get an agreement from sales
        about engineering commitments regarding deliverables, and be prepared
        to respond if you are asked to make a commitment during the meeting.
        If your answer is not an obvious <span class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span>, set a
        specific day by which you will be able to provide the answer—better to
        take some time to think through your answers to requests than to
        disappoint an important client. During this time, you can discuss the
        request's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0632"/>importance with sales to make appropriate business
        decisions.</p><p>When presenting information, coordinate with sales about who
        will present what information. Review each other's material before the
        meeting to check for inconsistencies and redundancies. Advance
        planning can make for a smoother presentation with fewer unpleasant
        surprises. You might find it helpful to practice delivering your

        people need to listen to the client's requirements, then talk to

        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0636"/>sales request validation. A sales request process
        usually requires rapid engineering response because the company needs
        to close deals and clients need the information to make
        decisions.</p><p>If your company doesn't have a sales request process, set one
        up. First, talk to sales about its needs and time frames. Then work
        out what information you generally need from sales to make estimates.
        Splitting estimates into <span class="emphasis"><em>firm quotes</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>rough quotes</em></span> can be useful in a cooperative
        environment. You can generate rough quotes faster than firm quotes and
        use ranges of delivery dates that require less information to create.
        Rough quotes can be useful for establishing the feasibility of

          commission, he listens to the client's needs and then makes promises
          on what can be delivered to match those needs. Unfortunately, on
          occasion, sales people will promise clients engineering deliverables
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0640"/>without first consulting you. In a poorly managed
          company, the CEO gives the sales team incentives to sell but
          enforces few controls over what they can sell. If the client's needs
          are greater than the product can deliver, a naïve,
          less-than-ethical, or uninformed sales person can promise the
          additional functionality without first confirming that those
          promises can be kept.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0641"/>Of course, such promises frustrate because they can
          and often do impact other, more reasonable, development team
          deliverables. Almost every engineering manager has run into the
          problem of unexpected customer promises <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0642"/>by overeager sales people, leading to a complete
          redefinition of the product release schedule. Sometimes even a
          relatively small client can "hijack" the development calendar,
          ultimately stunting future growth that depends on some planned
          functionality.</p><p>A mishandled new sale can shift the product direction away
          from the sweet spot of the market and toward one particular
          customer's needs. Instead of each sale demonstrating the market
          potential for the product, this sale diverts the company from
          creating the product that many customers really want. Small and
          growing companies need to keep to their product roadmap and continue
          to build on their whole product offering instead of bolting new
          features on to the current offering for one customer.</p><p>In some cases, your company will need to adjust the
          development calendar to close a particularly important deal. The CEO
          or executive team should be consciously making these types of
          decisions, as they will best understand the impact of the choice on
          the business.</p><p>To stop a cycle of unchecked sales promises, talk with your
          boss and the management team to create guidelines for a sales
          request process. You can make a strong business case for creating
          this process: Letting individual sales deals drive a small company's
          development strategy can lead to company stagnation or
          worse—failure. If requests for customer features as part of a large
          sale appear to drive the product off track, review the requests with
          senior management and, as a team, make an appropriate choice as a
          logical business decision. You may need to coach other team members
          if frustrations continue about business decisions that lead to
          inefficient delivery schedules or less-than-ideal technical
          solutions.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="requests_for_quotes"/>Requests for Quotes</h2></div></div></div><p>Long <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0643"/>sales cycles (6 to 12 months) are common for expensive
          and complex <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0644"/>software. Long <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0645"/>sales cycles are also common for <span class="emphasis"><em>software as
          a service (SAS)</em></span> offerings in which the long-term customer
          costs of the relationship are high. For these types of software
          purchases, customers investigate the product and service thoroughly
          before making a purchase because of the potential impact to their
          businesses. This investigation often starts <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0646"/>with a <span class="emphasis"><em>request for quote (RFQ)</em></span>,
          sometimes called a <span class="emphasis"><em>request for procurement</em></span> (or
          a <span class="emphasis"><em>proposal</em></span>). An <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0647"/>RFQ usually requires that engineering contribute
          information.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0648"/></p><p>Customers will issue RFQs for expensive software and expect a
          quote from the company that indicates price and often specific
          services and new program features. Typically, the sales team will be
          responsible for supplying RFQ responses. Sales will send customer
          requests to development and other teams to provide the information
          required to complete the quote. Most RFQs include questions
          appropriate for engineering that help the customer assess how the
          software works as well as its risks and reliability. Typically, the
          RFQ requires a quick turnaround from engineering. Responses must be
          factually accurate, compact, and understandable, and they must
          highlight the positive aspects of the product.</p><p>Because supporting sales to respond to RFQs means development
          must quickly deliver information, preparation is critical. First,
          engineering must work with sales to devise a request process that
          defines how the sales team communicates requests to you, what
          information is included in the RFQs, and how engineering will
          respond. Failing to create a process will lead to mistakes, such as
          the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Sales failing to inform engineers of the need for a quote
              until the day it is due</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sales failing to provide crucial information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Guesstimates" provided <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0649"/>by individual engineers being treated as true

              preparing the wrong information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Schedule dates being misunderstood in the quote</p></li></ul></div><p>Second, devise a quick method <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0650"/>of providing estimates to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0651"/>sales team. The quicker the estimate, the more extra
          time you can insert to make sure that deliverables are released on
          time. When you create time estimates, make sure you clearly describe
          the quoted functionality and the accuracy of the estimate. In some
          cases, providing estimates based on rough time ranges can be useful
          to <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0652"/>sales and the customer as long as sales doesn't use
          them to price and sign the deal. (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING">Chapter 12</a> has more information on
          estimates.)</p><p>Third, build up a list of common <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0653"/>RFQ questions. Most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0654"/>requests include common questions that you can
          anticipate in advance. If you build this list in advance, you will
          need to supplement it only <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0655"/>with those few questions you did not expect. If you
          receive your first RFQ without having prepared for it, use the
          opportunity to start a list of questions and answers. As new
          questions come along, add them to your RFQ list.</p><p>Here are some examples of questions that might appear in an

                product, what languages were used in building it, and what
                standards your product follows. The customer may be looking

          provide a quick turnaround on a customer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0662"/>RFQ. Even if the RFQ includes a few surprising

          time to the schedule to allow for RFQs, as they can be time
          consuming and can require customer visits and multiple
          conversations. Depending on the nature <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0663"/>of your company's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0664"/>sales, you may also need to allow for some unplanned

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="support_and_customer_requests"/>Support and Customer Requests</h1></div></div></div><p>Every project seems to encounter customer requests and changes
        that crop up after the deal has been signed. Customers often discover
        issues and more specific requirements for a newly ordered software
        system. This information can help you improve your product.</p><p>Since you can be pretty sure that new customer requests will
        appear after development begins, add time up front to accommodate them
        in the production schedule. Account for a percentage of development
        time to support current customers. Scheduling <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0665"/>without allowing for late requests often leads to
        delays. Even more importantly, make sure that your company has
        implemented a <span class="emphasis"><em>change control process</em></span>. If no such
        process exists, work with other teams to create one. More information
        on a change control process can be found in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. PROJECT EXECUTION AND TRACKING">Chapter 14</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0666"/></p><p>Your company's customer service team is also a great conduit for
        information gathered from customers. Maintain a good relationship with
        the team to get the best information. Even the best relationship
        between engineering and customer service can become adversarial,
        however. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0667"/>customer support team empathizes with the customer's
        problems and may insist that you handle development requests and
        issues immediately.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e8889"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e8892"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e8895"/></p><p>From a practical point of view, the development manager must
        balance customer requests with ongoing development. Allowing the
        customer service team some control over how development handles client
        requests can improve the relationship between support and development.
        Set aside a fixed percentage of time and resources for dealing with
        customer service requests. Then, ask customer service management to
        set priorities for requests while considering other company
        stakeholders, including QA and the product manager. Ask customer
        support to order requests and grant them the budgeted engineering
        hours and quick estimates on their requests. In some cases, you may
        need to create a "bug repair release" to support client services if a
        history of deferring defect repairs exists.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="empowering_customer_support"/><p class="title"><b>EMPOWERING CUSTOMER SUPPORT</b></p><p>At my company, customer support had many ongoing requests from
          customers. Meeting with customer support became an intense weekly
          discussion. Customer support management wanted all customer requests
          fixed in the code quickly.</p><p>From my perspective, 25 percent of development time went to
          dealing with customers' defect and minor enhancement requests. The
          remaining new development consumed the rest of our time, and those
          schedules were under pressure. Not enough time was available to
          devote to customer requests.</p><p>I decided to shift the perspective of the customer support
          manager by pulling him into the solution. I gave him a budget equal
          to the maintenance time available and calculated in advance how many
          hours of time were available per release. We would provide quick
          estimates for him so he could decide how to spend his time per week.
          He would make the requests, spending his hourly allotment; we would
          schedule the work and tell him when it would go out in a
          release.</p><p>He was happy with this approach and began to appreciate the
          difficulty of servicing all customer requests when the budget was
          limited.</p><p>—Engineering director</p></div></div></body></html>
