This can include pretty much anyone who has anything to do with the software: The people who use it, the people who design it, the people who help others with problems . . . every last one of them is a valued community member.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1569" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1570" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1571" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Consider the commercial software world, where things tend to be quite top-down. When you have a problem, you go to some company that provides you with support. This company probably also designed and sold you the software, and you probably played no part in that process—you're the customer; they're the vendor. Open source is different: Rather than one business managing everything, everyone pitches in together and helps each other. People write software and fix faults because it helps other people and because they want to help. Everyone can play their part in offering feedback and suggestions and helping others with problems, and no one is in absolute control of the whole process. All in all, it's much more democratic and, in my opinion, much more fun!</p><p>The Ubuntu community in particular is large, vibrant, and notoriously friendly. In this chapter, you'll learn how to get the most out of it and how you can play your part by joining in and giving something back (if you like).</p><div class="sect1" title="Take Me to Your SABDFL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="take_me_to_your_sabdfl"/>Take Me to Your SABDFL</h1></div></div></div><p>Open source communities tend to have a well-defined structure, and Ubuntu is no exception. At the top of the pile is Ubuntu's founder, Mark Shuttleworth, whom you met in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. BECOMING A PENGUINISTA">Chapter 1</a>. He's the Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life (SABDFL), and according to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/governance/">http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/governance/</a>, his role is to "provide clear leadership on difficult issues and set the pace for the project." This doesn't mean that he makes all of the plans and decisions—that's more the job of the Technical Board, a group of senior Ubuntu contributors who figure out what shape the next Ubuntu release will take. Mark is just there to step in if no one can agree.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1572" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1573" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1574" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1575" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1576" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1577" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1578" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1579" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1580" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1581" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There's also the Community Council, which oversees the teams of contributors that make up the bulk of the project. There are lots of teams with all sorts of responsibilities: The Documentation Team writes the documentation for each release of Ubuntu, the Installer Team looks after the software used for installing Ubuntu, and so on. You can find a list of them at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams/</a>. Teams consist of members from all over the world (<a class="xref" href="ch20.html#a_world_map_showing_the_locations_of_the" title="Figure 20-1. A world map showing the locations of the members of the Ubuntu Documentation Team">Figure 20-1</a>), and people on the team may have all sorts of responsibilities: Developers, for example, are the people who write and update the software. Last, but certainly not least, are the millions of Ubuntu users worldwide who form the biggest part of the community.

Renowned computer scientist Grace Hopper, on retrieving a moth from a relay in one such giant, taped the offending insect into her log book and remarked that she had found a "bug" in the computer. Well, computers may have changed a lot since the 1940s, but some of the terminology hasn't. Whether it's as major as a program crashing or freezing or as minor as a missing icon, any problem that you find with a piece of software is still referred to as a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1599" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1600" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1601" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1602" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1603" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You've almost certainly come across a bug before—no software, whether commercial or open source, is ever perfect. The difference with open source is that you're strongly encouraged to report problems wherever you see them. Developers need feedback in the form of bug reports so they know what needs fixing, and problems get fixed more quickly if they're reported sooner. Filing a bug report is a relatively easy way of giving something back to the community; it doesn't take long, it helps to improve the software for everyone, and you get an annoying software problem fixed for free!</p><div class="sect2" title="What Counts as a Bug?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="what_counts_as_a_bug_question"/>What Counts as a Bug?</h2></div></div></div><p>There are lots of different types of bug, but you can usually fit them into one of the following categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>When a program crashes, freezes, or shows an error message for no good reason (for example, <a class="xref" href="ch20s03.html#if_a_program_crashes_open_parenthesis_li" title="Figure 20-3. If a program crashes (like Gwibber here), it's probably a bug">Figure 20-3</a>)<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1604" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When something doesn't work (for example, when a button does nothing when you click it)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When hardware (such as a printer or your sound card) misbehaves or doesn't work at all</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Typos, missing icons, and other cosmetic mistakes</p></li></ul></div><p>If your problem fits any of these descriptions, then you likely have a bug on your hands! You should be aware of a few notable exceptions, though. First, if a program is missing a feature, that's not a bug. You can make a feature request using the Brainstorm website (see <a class="xref" href="ch20s04.html" title="Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu">Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch20s04.html" title="Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu">Sharing Ideas on How to Improve Ubuntu</a>). Second, you shouldn't ask for help with software by reporting a bug, since you probably won't get a response. Use the forums or IRC instead; find out more on those in <a class="xref" href="ch20s05.html" title="The Ubuntu Forums">The Ubuntu Forums</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch20s05.html" title="The Ubuntu Forums">The Ubuntu Forums</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch20s06.html" title="Chatting on IRC">Chatting on IRC</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch20s05.html#creating_your_own_thread" title="Creating Your Own Thread">Creating Your Own Thread</a>. Finally, it's important that the bug is <span class="emphasis"><em>reproducible</em></span>. This means that you can provide a set of instructions for someone else to follow, and they will experience the same problem as you. Sometimes computers just do one-off weird things, so if it's not repeatable, there's little chance that the problem can be identified and fixed.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1605" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="if_a_program_crashes_open_parenthesis_li"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject20_d1e24779"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656717.png.jpg" alt="If a program crashes (like Gwibber here), it's probably a bug"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-3. If a program crashes (like Gwibber here), it's probably a bug</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Reporting a Bug"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="reporting_a_bug"/>Reporting a Bug</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're confident you've found a bug, it's time to tell someone about it!

Comments are sometimes technical in nature, so it might be necessary to ask around on the forums for help with some of the more cryptic instructions.

The sheer volume of bugs isn't easy to cope with, and dealing with them has been likened to "drinking from a firehose." To calm the chaos, an army of volunteers called the Bug Squad pore over all the new bugs, categorizing them, identifying ones that have already been reported, asking for details on how the bug happens, and generally trying to get enough information together for a developer to be able to swoop in and fix the issue. In practical terms, this means it can take quite a while for a problem to be fixed, although the actual timescale will depend on how important the bug is judged to be. I normally reckon on waiting two to three months for an "average" bug. Having said that, my Rhythmbox bug hasn't been fixed yet, and it's several years later!

Chats happen in real time and are very similar to using an instant messaging service.

First, you'll need to make sure you have the right chat software. Open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for <span class="emphasis"><em>XChat IRC</em></span> (not to be mistaken for XChat-GNOME), and install it. Once you've done that, limber up your clicking finger, and follow these steps:<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1681" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Internet</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>XChat IRC</strong></span> to start XChat.

The nickname of the person talking is to the left of the vertical dividing line, and their message is on the right.

Why shouldn't it? Ubuntu is a very international venture, and communicating online is the most practical way of getting things done. Regardless, there are plenty of opportunities to contact and meet other Ubuntu users in your area through Local Community (LoCo) teams and Linux User Groups (LUGs). These groups often have a membership with diverse computing skills, so they can be a good place to go to get help with Linux, among other things.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1716" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1717" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1718" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1719" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1720" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1721" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1722" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1723" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1724" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-1725" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>LoCos</em></span> tend to cover reasonably large geographic areas, normally on the scale of whole countries or states.

<div class="sect1" title="Getting Involved"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="getting_involved"/>Getting Involved</h1></div></div></div><p>Lots of people enjoy being part of the Ubuntu community and want to give something back by volunteering to help.

I stumbled into contributing to Ubuntu in early 2006, when I started tidying up some bug reports that were missing information. It was something to pass the time and took up about half an hour per day. This was back when Launchpad was new and all the bugs were being transferred from the old system, so the work was pretty fun. The members of the Bug Squad were incredibly encouraging, and I soon found myself spending more and more time doing Ubuntu stuff. As time went on, I started editing help pages on the wiki (<a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/</a>) and eventually found my way to the Documentation Team, where I coauthored a guide on switching from Windows to Ubuntu. Nowadays I'm one of the maintainers of the official help files, among other things. Being a contributor has been a great experience—I've met tons of interesting new people, indulged my interests in writing and computers, traveled to conferences around the world, and, most importantly, had tons of fun in the process.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-1732" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Browse to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/">http://www.ubuntu.com/community/</a> to get some ideas on how you might be able to help. You don't need to be a geek to get involved: Artists, writers, multilinguists, marketers . . . the list of ways to participate just goes on. You can even attend a conference and have as much fun as the contributors in <a class="xref" href="ch20s10.html#just_a_few_of_ubuntu_apostrophy_s_many_c" title="Figure 20-13. Just a few of Ubuntu's many contributors at a conference (image created by Kenneth Wimer; used under Creative Commons license; original can be found at )">Figure 20-13</a>!
