    back audio files, you may be wondering whether Ubuntu will allow you to transfer
    any of those files to your digital media devices, such as your MP3 player, cell
    phone, or iPad. Well, you will be happy to know that using your device with your
    Ubuntu system is quite easy—easier than ever, in fact. No longer do you have to
    mess around with mount and unmount commands or edit system tables, and if you
    don’t know what I’m talking about, consider yourself lucky. Just plug in your
    device, and Ubuntu will do the rest.

    support files for the applications mentioned in [Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. Tux
    Rocks"), you shouldn’t encounter any problems handling any of the media files
    on your digital media device. Even if you didn’t install those codecs and files,
    Ubuntu will automatically help you find the necessary items if you try to play
    a file it hasn’t already installed support for. Nevertheless, not all formats
    will work with equal degrees of comfort or success—it depends on your device and
    the file format’s compatibility with Ubuntu. As a general rule of thumb, most
    players will be able to handle MP3 files and unlocked AAC (*.m4a*) files. Check
    your device’s manual for specifics about other file formats (or just give them
    a try).

    out of the way, it’s worth thinking about a couple of other things. Most important
    of these is the device’s auto-updating settings. When you enable auto-update on
    your iPod or iPhone via iTunes, the function is set up within the device itself.
    You can use your iPod in Windows, Mac OS, or Linux—or all of them interchangeably.
    If you set up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, however, you are leaving
    yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection on
    all of your machines.
  prefs: []

    not allow you to copy files *from* it. The auto-update feature is thus strictly
    a one-way street. This means that whenever you hook up your auto-update-enabled
    iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will automatically add the tracks in
    its library to your iPod—so far, so good. More frighteningly, it will remove any
    tracks from your iPod that are not present in that machine’s iTunes library. I
    learned this the hard way when I took my now ex-wife’s loaded iPod to work and
    plugged it into my office Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library. When
    I brought the little Podster back home to her with nothing at all on it, well
    . . . what ensued wasn’t pretty.'

    a lot of tinkering around from the command line. The reason was that these devices
    did not use the USB protocol that most of the other devices in this class use.
    Instead they used a file transfer protocol called MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)
    which was not Linux (or even Mac) friendly. The good news is that while these
    devices still use the MTP file transfer protocol, Linux, as of this Ubuntu 12.04
    release, has no problems working with these devices. This means that all those

    genres if you like) and drag the selected items to your desktop, music folder,
    or wherever you want them. The only catch with this mostly simple approach is
    that when copying files from an iPod/iPhone, you end up with files on your hard
    disk with funky filenames, such as *ZPAD.m4a* or *ATDT.mp3*, rather than the name
    that appeared on your iPhone/iPod or within Rhythmbox. This means you’ll have
    to rename the files once they have been transferred to your hard disk. This isn’t
    too much of a chore unless you’re dealing with lots and lots of files or if you’ve
    forgotten which file is which. In the latter case, right-click the file, click
