    that he or she hopes to accomplish when the work is completed. This is why you
    can go into a library or bookstore, pick up several books that cover the same
    subject, and discover that they are surprisingly different—not just in their content
    or scope, but in their entire approach to the material.

    don't need to know them in order to read and appreciate the material, but understanding
    what I had in mind while I was writing may help you while you are reading. And
    if you are reading this information prior to buying *The TCP/IP Guide*, knowing
    what I strove for in writing the book may help you decide if this is the right
    resource for you.

    anyone to obtain a deep understanding of how TCP/IP technologies really work.
    To accomplish this, I had a number of specific objectives that guided my writing
    efforts:'

- en: '**Comprehensiveness** Like most authors writing a resource that covers a large
    subject, I wanted *The TCP/IP Guide* to be comprehensive. Of course, no single
    document can cover everything, so I have needed to limit the scope of the material.
    However, I feel I cover more about TCP/IP as a whole than any other single book
    or other resource.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Comprehensibility** Creating a resource that is comprehensive is important,
    but I felt that it was even more important that the book be *comprehensible*.
    Over the past few years, I''ve had the opportunity to review many hundreds of
    books, guides, websites, and papers related to networking. I have found that even
    though most of them are generally high in quality, too many use unexplained technical
    jargon or assume extensive prior knowledge of networking concepts and technologies
    on the part of the reader. I worked very hard to ensure that my descriptions,
    even of very complex concepts, can be understood by almost every student of networking.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Rationale** It''s certainly important to know how every TCP/IP protocol functions.
    However, to gain a true understanding of complex material, one also needs to understand
    the reasons behind why things are what they are. In writing this material, I have
    always tried to explain not just the *what*, but also the *why* of TCP/IP. I have
    anticipated and answered questions that I believe might commonly arise in the
    mind of someone learning about this technology.'

- en: '**Illustrations** A picture is worth a thousand words, as they say. There are
    many concepts that no amount of verbiage will adequately explain, while a simple
    illustration will do the trick. For this reason, I spent many months creating
    more than 300 diagrams (some simple and some not so simple!) to complement the
    written material in *The TCP/IP Guide*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**User-friendliness** I have intentionally broken many of the rules of conventional
    book authorship, in creating a document that uses a conversational, first-person
    style, and no small amount of humor where appropriate. My intention was to make
    you feel at home while you read material that can be quite technically difficult.
    I want you to think of me as a friend sitting next to you at your computer explaining
    how TCP/IP works, rather than a professor preaching at you from a podium.'

- en: '**Organization** Many networking books consist of dozens of subjects just listed
    one after the other, leaving the reader to wonder how everything fits together.
    When I first began this book, I spent weeks just organizing it, with the result
    being a structure that indicates clearly how subjects are interrelated. I also
    carefully laid out each individual section to ensure that it covered its topic
    in a way that made sense.'

- en: '**Multiple levels of detail** I realize that some people reading a TCP/IP book
    might want only a quick summary of the operation of its constituent protocols,
    while others want to learn all the nuances of how everything works. I have provided
    the full details that most readers will want, while also including overview topics
    in each chapter that summarize each technology for quick perusal. This gives you
    the option of either skimming the surface or "diving deep," as you choose.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Platform independence** I have endeavored whenever possible to avoid describing
    TCP/IP in terms specific to any hardware or software platform. Even though I use
    a PC for most of my computing and UNIX for some tasks, most of the material is
    not particular to any type of device or operating system (though I do focus more
    on networks of smaller computers than larger ones).'

    So, I have to come clean with you, my reader. I have a problem: an addiction to
    … detail. Every time I set out to write about a particular protocol, technology,
    or concept, I start with a modest goal regarding how much I want to write. I always
    begin knowing that I really need to control myself, to prevent my project from
    going on forever. But as I explore each subject, I learn more and more, and I
    start to say to myself things like, "This is important. I simply *must* include
    coverage for it," and, "If I''m going to cover subject #1, I also should cover
    subject #2, because they are related." This is how I turn six-month projects into
    multiyear ordeals.'

    realized I could not possibly cover *everything* related to TCP/IP in this book.
    Consider that the TCP/IP suite contains dozens of protocols and technologies,
    each written about in thick books. I was willing to spend years on this project,
    but not decades! Thus, I had to limit the scope of this book somewhat, both to
    preserve what remains of my sanity and to spare you from having to wade through
    a ridiculously large document.

    to limit the scope of *The TCP/IP Guide*:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Theory versus practice** This is primarily a *reference resource* on the
    TCP/IP protocol suite. The material here is designed to allow a student to learn
    the nuts and bolts of how TCP/IP works. I do discuss quite a number of "real-world"
    practical issues related to how TCP/IP internetworks operate, but this is not
    my primary focus here. If you want to really understand what TCP/IP is and what
    makes it work, you''ve come to the right place. If all you want is simple instructions
    on how to connect a few PCs together in your home using TCP/IP, this probably
    isn''t the book for you.'

- en: '**Current versus future protocols** Most of the emphasis in this book is on
    the present state of the art in TCP/IP. The suite is always changing, new protocols
    are constantly being written, and revisions to existing protocols continue to
    be published. I have not provided extensive coverage of technologies still in
    development, to try to keep the size of the book manageable and to prevent the
    book from being out-of-date before it even hits the store shelves. The one exception
    to this general rule of thumb is version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6), which
    represents a significant change to the core of how most of TCP/IP operates. While
    not universally deployed yet, IPv6 is sufficiently far along in its development
    that I feel any student of TCP/IP needs to know what it is, learn how it works,
    and understand its significance. Thus, I have included several detailed chapters
    on IPv6, and also mentioned how it impacts the operation of several other key
    protocols such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Domain Name System
    (DNS), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).'

- en: '**Application coverage** Many thousands of different applications run on TCP/IP
    internetworks, and I could not possibly hope to describe all of them. The scope
    of this book is limited to the most important, "classic" TCP/IP applications and
    application protocols, such as electronic mail, general file transfer, and the
    World Wide Web.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**TCP/IP versus the Internet** The TCP/IP protocol suite and the Internet are
    very closely related in many ways, as you will discover as you read this book.
    In fact, they are often tied together so much that it is hard to discuss one without
    the other. However, the Internet as a whole is an enormous subject, and trying
    to describe it in general terms would have substantially increased the size of
    this book. Thus, I describe Internet issues only within the context of explanations
    of TCP/IP technologies. For example, while I cover the World Wide Web in this
    book, I discuss its generalities only briefly. I focus my technical discussions
    on how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that implements it works. I don''t
    talk about how to set up a website, how to choose a web browser, or any of those
    sorts of details. Those subjects are covered in a dazzling array of different
    books, papers, and, of course, websites.'

    topic, especially in modern networking. This book does include a fairly detailed
    section on the operation of the IP Security protocol (IPSec), and also touches
    on security issues in describing several other protocols and technologies. However,
    it is not specifically geared toward detailed discussions of security considerations.'

- en: '**Small computer orientation** In general terms, TCP/IP technologies can be
    used to connect together any types of devices that have the appropriate hardware
    and software. There are some issues, however, where explanations require me to
    focus on how specific types of underlying networks and devices work; this is especially
    true of some of my diagrams. In these cases, my preference has generally been
    to show how TCP/IP is used to connect together typical small computers such as
    PCs, Macintoshes, and UNIX workstations, which are what most people use.'

    depth of information about TCP/IP. This meant including a lot of content in this
    book—it has 88 chapters, several hundred sections, and more than 1,600 pages.
    However, I recognized as I was writing this tome that the real goal is not just
    to provide a lot of detailed information, but also to present it in such a way
    that it can be easily understood by you, the reader. This requires more than just
    writing large amounts of text and putting it all into a big file.

- en: First, *The TCP/IP Guide* uses a three-level structure to organize its content.
    The book as a whole is divided into three overall *sections*, covering overview/background
    information, lower-layer protocols, and higher-layer application protocols, respectively.
    Within each section is a number of *parts*, which group together related chapters.
    Each chapter is, in turn, structured with sections and subsections to present
    the material in the most understandable way possible.

- en: '*The TCP/IP Guide* contains more than 300 detailed illustrations, which support
    the textual descriptions of TCP/IP technologies and protocols, and help make sense
    of difficult concepts. Most include brief descriptions that allow you to quickly
    understand what the illustration means without even needing to read the full surrounding
    text. The book also has more than 300 tables, which present large amounts of information
    in an organized and readable manner or highlight examples.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the discussions in *The TCP/IP Guide* are presented as free-form text,
    as you would expect in any document. However, I use *notes* when I need to clarify
    or explain something that I feel you need to know, but which is either not directly
    related to the topic under discussion or is sufficiently "tangential" that it
    needs to be separated from the main text to avoid disrupting its flow. Examples
    include terminology explanations, "sidebar" historical discussions, anecdotes,
    and clarifications relating to how I am describing particular concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last, but definitely not least, are the *key concepts* inserts. I tried very
    hard in crafting this book to provide a variety of ways to present information,
    to better suit the learning styles of different readers. To that end, I have created
    hundreds of these special paragraphs, which summarize and highlight the most important
    concepts and essential pieces of knowledge in *The TCP/IP Guide*. They can be
    very useful for quickly distilling the essence of a topic without reading an entire
    explanation, or for refreshing your memory of a subject. Obviously, however, they
    contain few details, so you should not assume that you fully understand a topic
    or concept just by reading this sort of summary.

    to you personally, because that's how I feel when I am writing. A published book
