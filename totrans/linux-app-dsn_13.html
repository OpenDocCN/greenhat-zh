<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/as.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="nb">We like to say that the difference between a hobby and a commercial network appliance is SNMP. Any corporation with a large network will use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as part of its network- and system-management solution. You simply cannot sell into the large enterprise and telecommunications carrier markets without SNMP support on your appliance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If your target market includes companies with large networks and you are not confident in your knowledge of SNMP, this chapter is for you. If, however, you will be targeting the home or small business market (or your appliance will not be networked at all), you can safely skip this and the SNMP chapters that follow.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This chapter will introduce SNMP and provide you with an appreciation of some of the things SNMP can do. The topics covered in this chapter are:</p>&#13;

</ul>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.1"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.1"><b>A Quick Note on Terminology</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here is a quick tour of the most basic concepts and terms you will need in order to understand the material in this chapter. For a complete introduction to SNMP concepts and terminology, see Appendix B.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><i>SNMP is</i> a protocol designed to facilitate the reading and writing of small amounts of information over a network, like single numbers and character strings. You would not use SNMP for large volumes of data, like file transfer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A read operation in SNMP is called a GET, while a write is called a SET. The target of a SET or GET operation is called an object. An <i>object</i> is like a field in a database record.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">SNMP treats objects as if they were organized into a single large database called the <i>Management Information Base (MIB).</i> It may be helpful to think of SNMP as an API to the information on a device. It hides the details of object retrieval beneath an organized hierarchical namespace. An SNMP agent on each system provides this API. The <i>agent is</i> a background (daemon) process listening for SNMP requests on UDP port 161. Beneath the API, the agent may interact with the kernel or some application process running on the system; it may also read several pieces of information from different sources and apply a mathematical formula to furnish the value defined in a MIB. An object in the MIB may also represent functionality rather than data; for example, setting a MIB object to a particular value might trigger a reboot or the restarting of a service.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The MIB hierarchical namespace is much like the Unix filesystem, but it uses numbers instead of directory and filenames, and it uses the . character instead of the / directory separator. So, whereas a file path may look like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">/usr/sbin/ifconfig</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">the name (called an <i>Object Identifier,</i> or <i>OID)</i> for an object in the MIB might look like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">MIB files describe portions of the complete MIB database. Typically, each MIB file describes a <i>MIB module,</i> which is a subtree of the overall database. MIB files are both human readable and program readable. They document the MIB for humans, and they provide a means for programs to translate between these number strings and their human-readable names. Although we have talked about <i>the MIB</i> as the SNMP-addressable universe, the more common use of the term <i>MIB</i> is for one of these named subtrees. For example, you will hear talk of the <i>Host Resources MIB,</i> or the <i>HP Printer MIB,</i> or <i>MIB-2.</i> These are all subtrees, but they are also all addressable within the overall namespace.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page225"/>First and foremost among MIBs is the cryptically named <i>MIB-II.</i> When SNMP was first created, the SNMP working group of the IETF defined a core set of information. This was the first MIB, or <i>MIB-I.</i> A few years later, the SNMP WG revised this core set and it became <i>MIB-II.</i> We use <i>MIB-2,</i> rather than MIB-II, in this chapter to match the name used in the MIB file that defines this MIB.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once you have the right MIB files installed (you’ll see how to do this later), you can use the snmptranslate command to give you the human-readable names for a numeric ID (more on this later, too). For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$snmptranslate -Of .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1<br/>.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr<br/>$</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This should be enough terminology to get started.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.2"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.2"><b>The Software</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Net-SNMP is an excellent free package containing all you’ll need to follow along in this chapter. Net-SNMP will provide you with commands (snmpget, snmpset, snmpwalk, snmptrap), an SNMP agent, and the standard MIB files. Normally, the commands and agent would be running on different systems, but for simplicity you’ll be running both on the same system. If you have two systems available, you can perform the full installation on both systems; then you can run snmpget, for example, on one system, and talk to the agent on the other. If you use two systems, remember to change all instances of localhost or 127.0.0.1 in this chapter’s code to the name or address of the system running the SNMP agent.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.3"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.3"><b>Installing SNMP</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before installing, check to see if Net-SNMP is already installed on your system—many common Linux distributions provide some version of it. If you have a very old Linux distribution (like Red Hat 7.<i>x</i>) you may find UCD-SNMP instead; this is an older version—or parent—of Net-SNMP. Although its behavior is very similar to that of Net-SNMP, there are enough differences to confuse someone trying to follow this tutorial; you should remove it, and follow the instructions here to install Net-SNMP. If you find some other package installed, definitely remove it before continuing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page226"/>Even if Net-SNMP is not currently installed on your system, it may be packaged with your Linux distribution, so check your CDs. Be aware, though, that various Linux distributions may have modified Net-SNMP to comply with their own ideas of default file locations and it may include different patches. Naturally, the closer your version of Net-SNMP is to the one used in this chapter (version 5.2.1), the closer your results will be to the ones shown here.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.4"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.4"><i><b>Download and Install</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If Net-SNMP is not included with your Linux distribution, you can download it from <a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net</a>. You can install either from RPM (assuming you are running an RPM-based distribution like Fedora) or source, but for now let’s install the binary RPM. (By the way, if rpm complains about missing dependencies, you may have to take care of them first and then retry this command.)</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/250-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.5"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.5"><i><b>Check the Installation</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now test that it worked. First, test the agent.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/250-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now check the tools. Use which to find out where they were installed, then list all the commands in that directory that start with <i>snmp</i>.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/250-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll only use a handful of these commands, but feel free to explore others once you’ve mastered the basics.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page227"/>Now let’s check the version to make sure it is what we just installed and not some older version that’s lurking on your path.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpwalk --version<br/>NET-SNMP version: 5.2.1<br/>$</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.6"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.6"><i><b>Configure the Agent</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far, so good—you have the client-side programs. Now you need to get the agent running so these programs have something to query.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The agent runs as a daemon and listens for incoming SNMP requests on UDP port 161, by default. It requires some configuration information that it normally picks up from the file snmpd.conf in the directory /etc/snmp. (Note the <i>d</i> in snmpd.conf; it indicates <i>daemon</i>—our agent. Do not confuse this with snmp.conf, which we will introduce later on.) Snmpd.conf tells the agent how to authenticate incoming requests, where to send traps (which are SNMP alarm notifications), and so forth.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Net-SNMP provides a program called snmpconf that generates the snmpd.conf file from the answers to a series of questions, but because your needs here are pretty simple, you can generate the configuration by hand. Your snmpd.conf file should contain:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/251-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rocommunity macro sets your read-only community string, which for now you can think of as something like a password. Net-SNMP gives you much more precise access control than this, but that’s beyond our needs right now.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The syslocation and syscontact lines set the values for the sysLocation and sysContact objects in the MIB-2 system group. When you are managing only a small set of systems all in one location, this information may not be very interesting, but in a large corporate network with multiple sites, it may be invaluable to know how to locate a system and find out who is in charge of it. (A little later in this chapter, you’ll see how to access this information across the network with SNMP queries.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Place this snmpd.conf file into the /etc/snmp directory. The three lines above are all you’ll need to get started.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.7"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.7"><i><b>Start the Agent</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Start the agent, and put it into the background. The agent listens on port 161, so you’ll need to be logged in as root to issue this command:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">/usr/sbin/snmpd -c /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf -C &amp;</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page228"/>The -c /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf tells the agent to use the given configuration file, and -C tells the agent to use only this configuration file.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For now, you can just type the above command (as root), but on your appliance you’ll want the SNMP agent to start up with the system.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.8"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.8"><b>Exploring with SNMP</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now let’s turn our attention to the client side. The commands snmpget, snmpwalk, and snmpset are all SNMP client commands, or <i>SNMP management applications,</i> in SNMP-speak. SNMP uses the term <i>manager</i> or <i>management application</i> for the client side and <i>agent</i> for the server side. The agent serves up the data on the appliance, and the SNMP manager is the client requesting the appliance’s information. You won’t need to be logged in as root to use these client commands.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s use snmpget to test our agent install.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpget -v2c -c public localhost sysLocation.0<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING: "my den"<sup>3</sup><br/>$</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ve told snmpget to use SNMPv2c (community-based SNMP version 2) and the community string public to send a query to the local machine asking for the value of the sysLocation variable, which you configured in your snmpd.conf file. The .0 appended to the sysLocation name is SNMP’s way of indicating that you want the <i>instance</i> of this variable. In object-oriented language, think of sysLocation as a class that has one instance. If this were an array (table) of locations, the .0 would be replaced by the row number of the variable (.1, .2, .3, and so on). Row numbers always start with 1, so there is no confusion between a row index and a scalar indicator.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You need to tell the snmpget command to use SNMPv2c, because it defaults to SNMPv3; you can change that by generating an snmp.conf file with a different default. You could use snmpconf to generate the file, this time selecting snmp.conf (no <i>d)</i>, but you can also just create the snmp.conf file by hand with this single command (run as root).</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">echo "defversion 2c" &gt; /etc/snmp/snmp.conf</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you can stop typing the -v2c with each command.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page229"/>If you have access to any other networked devices, you might try querying them. For example, here’s the snmpwalk command run against an Apple AirPort Base Station:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/253-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Clearly, the device’s sysDescr.0 (system description) identifies this as an Apple Base Station. You’ll also recognize the sysLocation and sysContact information for this device. This device doesn’t offer up a lot of information, but there is enough to identify what it is, where it is, and who to contact about any issues you have with this box, should you discover that it’s misbehaving. Of course, the availability of the system contact and location both rely on the administrator of that system, who is configuring these values on the target device. An inattentive system administrator may leave you little to work with.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that for this query we used snmpwalk instead of snmpget because we wanted to see what other information might be furnished by this device. The snmpget command retrieves a single object instance using an SNMP GET protocol data unit, while snmpwalk uses multiple SNMP GETNEXT PDUs to “walk” an entire MIB. You pick a starting point, and snmpwalk asks for the lexically next object instance; the agent returns that object and its OID, and snmpwalk asks for the next object instance after the new OID. Eventually, the agent responds that there is nothing more to return, and the walk terminates.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.9"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.9"><i><b>MIB Files for Readable Names</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The display of nice, readable names for OIDs—like <i>sysDescr</i> and <i>sysLocation</i>—depends on having the right MIB files registered on your client system. In the case of Net-SNMP, <i>registration</i> simply means putting these files in the right directory and telling the SNMP commands (like snmpget and snmpwalk) to use them. You can set a few environment variables to do this job for you. Just put these lines in your shell startup file (e.g., .bashrc):</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">export MIBS=ALL<br/>export MIBDIRS=/usr/share/snmp/mibs</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you installed Net-SNMP, it placed a set of standard MIB files in /usr/share/snmp/mibs, as you can see in the list below. These are all plaintext files written using a human-readable and machine-parseable syntax.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1">Some of these actually describe MIBs. Others are support files that define information needed by the files that describe the MIBs, just as header files are used in the C language.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><a id="page230"/><img src="../images/254-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Without these MIB files, the display of the Apple Base Station system group would have looked like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/254-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can still tell a lot about the device just from examining the responses, but it’s nice to know what the OIDs mean.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.10"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.10"><i><b>A Networked Printer</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="page231"/>Let’s try another query against a different kind of device:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/255-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This time, the administrator has not set sysContact and sysLocation. However, we can at least determine the type of device being used. One clue is in the sysDescr field: <i>HP ETHERNET . . . JETDIRECT. . . .</i> This is a networked HPJetdirect printer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another clue, though one much harder for a novice to read, is in the <i>sysObjectID</i>—the OID in this field indicates the type of device. This OID starts with enterprises, indicating that the next number (11) is the enterprise number of the manufacturer; you can find a list of manufacturers’ enterprise numbers at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers</a>. Here you will find that 11 is registered to Hewlett Packard. The rest of the OID (.2.3.9.1) would identify the type of device, if you had the right MIB file on your system.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.11"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.11"><i><b>The snmptable Command</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This printer’s SNMP agent offers much more information than just the system group, giving us a chance to illustrate another command, snmptable. This command behaves much like snmpwalk, but it formats the output differently. We use it here to look at the TCP Connection Table on the same HP Jetdirect printer.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/255-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page232"/>From this table you can see the TCP ports on which the printer is listening. You can also see that two connections are in <i>timeWait</i> state, one between the printer (10.0.0.183, port 80) and a remote system (10.0.1.3, port 19333), and another between two TCP ports on the local system itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.12"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.12"><i><b>MIB-2: The TCP Connection Table</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll take a look at our own system. Here is the TCP Connection Table from our local system:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/256-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Compare this to the information about our TCP listening habits from the output of netstat:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/256-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It is clearly the same information, right? SNMP lets you access this information not only on your local system, but on other systems across the network, as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now open Firefox, point your browser to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">http://www.cnn.com</a>, and then look at the TCP Connection Table again:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/256-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><a id="page233"/><img src="../images/257-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Several connections have been added to the table, all from ephemeral ports on your local system to port 80 on several remote systems. These are the connections used by the browser to fetch the various parts of the CNN main page.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.13"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.13"><i><b>MIB-2: The UDP Table</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Another table from MIB-2 that might be of interest is the UDP table.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/257-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This table shows the open UDP ports on your system, that is, the ports where some application on your system is listening. (The SNMP agent itself is listening on port 161.) For reference, the address of <i>this</i> system is 10.0.1.5.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Compare this with the netstat output. You’ll have to run netstat as root to get the program names.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/257-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.14"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.14"><i><b>MIB-2 Contents</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="page234"/>In SNMP, the term <i>group</i> refers to a subdivision of a MIB consisting of a collection of objects or tables that are related in some way. For example, MIB-2’s UPD and TCP groups are all about UDP and TCP traffic, respectively. The Net-SNMP agent can be built to support a variety of MIBs, but you can always expect to find the MIB-2 groups system, interfaces, ip, icmp, tcp, udp, and snmp. These are not all of the groups defined in MIB-2, but they are the ones most likely to be supported by any SNMP agent. Figure 13-1 shows the location of MIB-2 in the overall MIB address space and breaks out some of the groups that comprise MIB-2. Also notice the location of the private.enterprises branch. That’s where you can find the HP Printer MIB objects you saw earlier.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/258-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="cap"><i>Figure 13-1: MIB-2</i></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Try walking these groups:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/258-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you feel up to a challenge, try comparing the output of the above commands with the contents of the MIB files.<sup>6</sup> The output of the snmpwalk commands listed here will indicate, at the beginning of each output line, the MIB file where you can find the definition of the object displayed.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex"><a id="page235"/>SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInPkts.0 = Counter32: 5998<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::snmpOutPkts.0 = Counter32: 5998<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInBadVersions.0 = Counter32: 0</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These lines indicate that you can find these definitions in the MIB file SNMPv2-MIB.txt. For help interpreting what you find in the MIB file, you can read Appendix B.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You are also likely to find that your SNMP agent has been built to include the Host Resources MIB, the UCDavis MIB, and the newer Net-SNMP MIB. Try walking these with the following commands:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">snmpwalk -c public localhost enterprises ucdavis<br/>snmpwalk -c public localhost enterprises netSnmp</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One of the objects that might interest you is the version of your own agent.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$snmpget -c public localhost versionTag.0<br/>UCD-SNMP-MIB::versionTag.0 = STRING: 5.2.1</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.15"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.15"><b>Writing Values with SNMP</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As well as reading information from an agent, SNMP can be used to set the values of objects on a remote system. Let’s pick an object that is defined to have read-write access and experiment with it a little.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.16"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.16"><i><b>Setting sysContact</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Look through the MIB defining the system group in MIB-2. Remember that when we accessed the system group, the resulting display contained lines that looked like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: <a href="mailto:me@myaddr.com">me@myaddr.com</a><br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: localhost.localdomain<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING: "the den"</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">See the SNMPV2-MIB at the start of each line? That indicates that these objects are defined in the file SNMPv2-MIB.txt. If you look at the definitions of these objects in that file, you’ll see this snippet:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/259-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><a id="page236"/><img src="../images/260-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can see from this snippet that the MIB file defines the three objects we read the values of above: sysContact, sysName, and sysLocation. Each of these is described as an OBJECT-TYPE with a syntax of DisplayString, read-write access, and a status of current. Each object has a description and a line starting with :: =, meaning <i>is defined as. System</i> is a group in MIB-2 that has an OID of { .1.3.6.1.2.1.1 }. These lines in the MIB file indicate that these three object types are defined as objects 4, 5, and 6 following system (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1), so their OIDs are:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/260-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that these are OIDs of the OBJECT-TYPE definitions, not their instances. Remember, if you want to use snmpget to read the value of the instance, you need to add a .0 to the end of the type OID.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Enough of reading MIBs—we just want to find a read-write type so we can try a SET. Let’s try setting sysContact.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpset -c public localhost sysContact.0 s "<a href="mailto:me@myself.com">me@myself.com</a>"<br/>snmpset: Unknown host (Permission denied)<sup>8</sup><br/>$</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page237"/>The agent refused the request. Why? Remember your configuration file?</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/261-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You set a read-only community string, but not a read-write one, so you don’t have permission to set any values. You’ll have to configure a read-write community name. Add the following line to your snmpd.conf file to configure a read-write community string writer:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">rwcommunity writer</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you’ll need to bring this change to the attention of the SNMP agent. Send the agent a SIGHUP signal to make it re-read its configuration. You will have to do this as root:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">killall -s HUP snmpd</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now try snmpset again.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpset -c writer localhost sysContact.0 s "<a href="mailto:me@myself.com">me@myself.com</a>"<br/>Error in packet.<br/>Reason: notWritable (that object does not support modification)<br/>Failed object: SNMPv2-MB::sysContact.0</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The agent refused again! This time, the reason is a little less obvious. The Net-SNMP agent will refuse requests to set new values if the object’s value has been configured in the snmpd.conf file. This is not part of the SNMP standard, it’s just how Net-SNMP works. It presumes that since you configured these values through the snmpd.conf file, you probably don’t want someone else changing them remotely. If you want these values to be writable, you need to set their values using local snmpset commands, rather than by using the configuration file.</p>&#13;
<p class="seclas"><b>NOTE</b></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><i>Apologies for leading you astray here. Our intent was to highlight this non-obvious behavior of Net-SNMP and possibly save you some time later.</i></p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.17"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.17"><i><b>Setting sysName</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that you know sysContact and sysLocation are not writable for you because of their definitions in the configuration file, try sysName. You haven’t configured a value for that.</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpset -c writer localhost sysName.0 s "NewName"<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: NewName</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The snmpset command requires that you use the read-write community string and that you specify the name of the object instance, the type, and the new value. The s indicates that you are writing a string value. This tells the snmpset command how to format the SET packet. Had you written an integer variable, the type would have been i. For a full list of types, read the man page for snmpset. The type of the value you set, of course, must match the type of the object you are setting.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page238"/>Here’s what sysContact, sysName, and sysLocation look like now:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">$ snmpget -c public localhost sysContact.0 sysName.0 sysLocation.0<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: <a href="mailto:me@myaddr.com">me@myaddr.com</a><br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: NewName<br/>SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING: "the den"<br/>$</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.18"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.18"><b>SNMP Traps</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As well as responding to SNMP requests like SET and GET, SNMP-enabled devices in the network can send out spontaneous notifications of local events. These notifications are sent either as SNMP traps or informs. <i>Traps</i> are datagrams sent without the expectation of a response. <i>Informs</i> are an improvement over traps because they expect a confirmation response and are re-sent when the trap receiver does not confirm them in a timely fashion. The time-out and the number of retries can be set by the trap sender as parameters to the snmptrap command.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.19"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.19"><i><b>Receiving Traps with snmptrapd</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use snmptrapd to receive traps. In the 5.2.1 release of Net-SNMP, which we have been using in this chapter, all you have to do is open a separate terminal window and execute the following command as root:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">snmptrapd -Os -Le -f</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As of the 5.3 release, however, the security of snmptrapd was tightened so that it no longer defaults to accepting traps with any community name. In later versions, you need to create an snmptrapd.conf file in the /etc/snmp directory and include a line telling it which communities to accept. We will be using <i>public,</i> so our snmptrapd.conf file would contain the following:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">authCommunity log public</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you can issue the snmptrapd command described above to view the traps you receive.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This command normally runs in the background where it can receive traps, format them, and write them to a log file. However, you are using the -f parameter here to tell snmptrapd to stay in the foreground and the -Le parameter to send its output to stderr. You can also use the -Os parameter to tell snmptrapd to print only the last symbolic part of the OID, which will save space and make the output more readable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page239"/>Use a separate command window for sending traps using the snmptrap command. You’ll need to run snmptrapd as root, because it wants to listen on UDP port 162. To give it a quick try, run either of the following as root:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">snmptrap -c public localhost "" coldStart</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">or</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">snmptrap -c public localhost "" .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can change the format of the output to be much more readable than we show below, but that would require formatting instructions that are beyond what you need here. The default format for output from snmptrapd looks like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">2007-02-14 20:43:26 localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1]:<br/>sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (4694125) 13:02:21.25<br/>snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: cold Start</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that you are using SNMPv2. The format for sending an SNMPv1 trap is different and a bit more complicated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A coldStart trap technically means the network management software has restarted with no change in configuration. Typically, this only happens when the system running the agent has rebooted, so many users think of coldStart as a reboot indicator; however, it will also be sent any time the agent restarts. If you configure a trap target in the snmpd.conf file and restart the agent, your snmptrapd will receive a trap from it. Give it a try—add the following line to your snmpd.conf file:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">trap2sink localhost public</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now kill the agent and restart it, or send it another SIGHUP; snmptrapd will indicate that it has received a coldStart trap. Now that the agent has the trap target configured, restart it again. Here’s what snmptrapd will display this time:</p>&#13;
<p class="ex">2007-02-14 12:06:17 localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1]:<br/>sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (33324) 0:05:33.24 snmpTrapOID.0 = OID:<br/>nsNotifyShutdown<br/>2007-02-14 12:06:37 localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1]:<br/>sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (36) 0:00:00.36 snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: coldStart<br/>snmpTrapEnterprise.0 = OID: netSnmpAgentOIDs.10</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is a bit of a jumble, but you can find the beginning of each trap by looking for the time stamp. You will have received two traps: nsNotifyShutdown and coldStart. The agent had the trap target configured at the time it was shut down, so it sent out a trap indicating it was going away. When we started it again (20 seconds later, by the time stamp in this example) it sent a coldStart.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page240"/>Unlike the coldStart, nsNotifyShutdown is not a trap defined in the SNMP specification, but rather in the NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB.txt file. It is one of the Net-SNMP enterprise traps, meaning it has OIDs under the private.enterprises section of the MIB tree. This is where you will define your traps when you develop your own MIB in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="chapter13.20"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.20"><i><b>Traps That Carry Data: linkUp and linkDown</b></i></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The traps you’ve seen here, coldStart and nsNotifyShutdown, do not carry any extra data. They only tell you that a shutdown or startup happened. The generic traps linkDown and linkUp are different; they contain extra information as specified in the OBJECTS line of their definitions:</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/264-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The OBJECTS line in each trap definition is the list of parameters that will be sent in the trap. The first is ifIndex, which is the index into the interface table in the interfaces section under MIB-2. The others define the administrative and operational status of the interface. Try viewing this table on your own system. It is a little wide to display with the snmptable command, so here’s an snmpwalk of ifTable.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><img src="../images/264-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><a id="page241"/><img src="../images/265-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This trap shows that interface 2 (which you can see is eth0, from the walk of ifTable above) is administratively up but operationally down. Since this machine only has a single Ethernet interface, you’re unlikely to see any traps of this kind (you can’t send a trap from an interface that’s offline), but you would see the linkUp trap when the interface comes back up.</p>&#13;
<p class="imgl"><a id="page242"/><img src="../images/266-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By this time, you should be able to figure out how to send the trap that generated this output. Give it a try.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="chapter13.21"/><a href="toc.html#chapter13.21"><b>Summary</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This chapter has given you a taste of what SNMP can do. You have installed, configured, and started the Net-SNMP agent on your own computer. You have explored what SNMP can tell you about a networked machine using the snmpget, snmpwalk, and snmptable commands provided by Net-SNMP. You have modified one of the settings on your system (sysName) with SNMP. You have also sent and received some traps. Except for the brief probes of a wireless access point and networked printer, we have limited ourselves to the local machine so that even readers not currently on a network can still have some fun exploring.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We have also limited our tools to those which come with the Net-SNMP package. The nice thing about standard protocols is that software from multiple sources can interoperate. You might try taking a look at a MIB browser from another source. MIB browsers walk a MIB for you and give you a graphical view of the MIB tree offered by the target system. You can find one such browser at <a href="http://www.mibble.org/">http://www.mibble.org</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We hope this chapter has given you a taste for how useful SNMP can be to a network manager or IT professional. SNMP can be used to discover devices on a network, identify the type of device based on its IP address, or even reconfigure options on a device. This perspective will be helpful when it comes to designing your own MIB in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
