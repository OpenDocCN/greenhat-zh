      technology. Although technology is fun, good managers must first
      understand the people they work with. Focusing on technology instead of
      people is like coaching a baseball team and spending all your time
      testing the latest, greatest bats.</p><p>This section covers starting a new job, working with the
      development organization, and successfully growing your team. No need to
      worry; we'll talk about technology—just a little later.</p></div></div>
<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="getting_started"/>Chapter 1. GETTING STARTED</h1></div></div></div><p>Imagine you're hiking through the woods, following some new
      trails. The weather is perfect, and you are relaxed. As you walk along,
      you notice the landscape beginning to change as you enter unexplored,
      rugged wilderness. Eventually, you stop to sit on a large rock and eat a
      snack.</p><p>As you are eating, you realize that you have no idea where you
      are. You forgot to bring a map and neglected to plan a route or mark
      your path. Now you feel a sudden burst of tension and fear.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>You are lost.</em></span> You want to move faster—either
      continuing in the direction you were going or turning around to find
      your way back. But you know that panicking and running in any direction
      is a big mistake when you're lost in the woods.</p><p>You remember some crucial wilderness advice: When you're lost,
      stop, assess, and then act. You've stopped moving. You assess your
      situation and ask yourself a few questions: <span class="emphasis"><em>What do I know
      about where I am? Do I have tools, maps, or supplies in my backpack that
      would be helpful? How much time has gone by since I started out? How
      much time do I have to get back safely</em></span>? Next, you make a
      plan—and then you act.</p><p>Now, a shift of scenery: You are vice president of engineering at
      a small company that is growing rapidly into unfamiliar territory.
      Although you have been with the firm since the beginning, it's no longer
      the little startup you used to know. You feel lost in the woods without
      a map. Like the hiker, any fast and frantic actions will worsen your
      situation, so instead of panicking, you stop, assess the situation,
      gather what information you can, map out a strategy, and then
      act.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are starting a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0001"/>new job at a growing company, you might feel like you've
      been dropped into the middle of the woods—and you missed the pleasure of
      the initial hike in. The same approach to the situation applies,
      however: Stop to survey the landscape and collect what information you
      can before you act. By following these steps, whether you're new or
      newly lost, you can find your way.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="finding_your_way_in_a_new_job"/>Finding Your Way in a New Job</h1></div></div></div><p>As the volatility of technology companies increases, loyalty to
        company senior staff decreases. As a company folds or changes its
        focus, development managers often find themselves looking for
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0002"/>new jobs. Getting a new job, of course, starts with an
        interview.</p><p>Interviewers paint masterful pictures of their companies during
        interviews, like a softly focused Monet. But once you start the job,
        the picture begins to look distorted, somewhat like a Picasso. Small
        and subtle problems described to you during the interview process
        become huge crises that you must resolve immediately. <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#the_interview_vs_reality" title="Table 1-1. The Interview vs. Reality">Table 1-1</a> shows a tongue-in-cheek
        comparison between the interview statements and reality.</p><p>After you've joined the company and headed down that formidable

          Some problems will have built up since the last manager moved out of
          the position, leaving several months' worth of deferred decisions on
          your desk. <span class="emphasis"><em>Wading through a swamp</em></span> best
          describes the job of tackling that backlog.</p><p>You might feel pressure to focus exclusively on these issues,
          but that can be hazardous to your long-term success. By focusing
          only on the pressing concerns, you can miss opportunities to learn
          about your company, its products, your co-workers, and your team. So
          take a deep breath and see the bigger picture.</p><p>If you split your time between tackling the outstanding issues
          and handling day-to-day crises, you will eventually reduce some of
          the reoccurring problems, thus improving the effectiveness of your
          team. Spending part of each day learning about your company will be
          more effective than spending all your time clearing out the problem
          backlog. In addition, you'll better understand the bigger problems
          faced by your team, which will allow you to start addressing them
          sooner. Many issues will pop up during the day and continually force
          you to shift your focus. You can keep this process from becoming too
          chaotic by creating a system for handling the many demands on your
          time.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="maintain_a_list_of_issues_and_efforts"/>Maintain a List of Issues and Efforts</h3></div></div></div><p>Careful task management and good record-keeping will help
            from the start. Maintain a list of your decisions and efforts as
            well as the big issues, especially those that are presented to you
            as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0005"/>urgent problems. Organize the list in prioritized
            sections along with notes about required completion dates.
            Managing this list will help lower your anxiety about missing any
            issues, and an assembled list will let you review your priorities
            and efforts with your boss.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0006"/></p><p>Review your task list daily and target priority issues. For
            large tasks, target subsets that you can complete in a short time.
            Focus energy on large, high-priority tasks every week; otherwise,
            they will continue to be deferred by short-term pressing demands.
            Assume that you will have only a limited amount of time during the
            day to work on these issues: Avoid overbooking your time and
            hindering your progress.</p><p>As you complete a task to resolve an issue, mark it as such
            with a date and archive the task. This archive can be helpful
            later, when you're asked whether and how you handled specific
            issues. Checking off completion is also good for your
            morale.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="delegate_when_possible"/>Delegate When Possible</h3></div></div></div><p>Delegate responsibility as appropriate for some immediate
            issues instead of trying to tackle them all yourself. Proper
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0007"/>delegation makes you and your team more productive,
            and the opportunity to tackle new tasks is good for team member
            morale. When delegating, make sure the delegatee understands the
            task, its priority relative to other work, any status check-in
            dates, and a due date. Also make sure that the team members know
            they can come to you for more information.</p><p>If delegating an entire task is not appropriate, you can
            assign parts of the task to team members. For example, you could
            assign information collection tasks to others and reserve
            assessment for yourself. Or you could ask a team member to provide
            background research on an issue and then coach the person on
            approaches to analyzing the data. If you give team members an
            opportunity to take on part of an important job, you all
            benefit.</p><p>As you work through the immediate <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0009"/>issues, remember to keep your boss apprised of your
            progress. This can help prevent misconceptions about your
            efforts.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="undergoing_initial_training"/>Undergoing Initial Training</h2></div></div></div><p>Success during your initial training period will require
          focused effort and time. Reserve a fixed amount of time each day for
          learning about your company's employees, technology, products,
          market, and process. Find an hour or two when you are most alert and
          able to focus your attention. Arrive early and spend the start of
          each day on your training, and continue to reserve this time later
          to tackle difficult issues. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0010"/></p><p>As a new development manager, you'll probably experience a
          short "<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0011"/>honeymoon period" of three to six weeks, when your
          boss gives you some leeway to learn about your job and the company
          culture. You should expect to work some overtime hours during this
          time, but these extra hours offer you time to learn about and act on
          important issues. If your boss recognizes your extra efforts, she'll
          feel satisfied with her decision to hire you in the first place.
          After you have shown what you can do, you can scale back your hours
          to a reasonable and sustainable level that works for you.</p><p>Know whether you were hired specifically to be a change agent
          or whether you are expected to make incremental changes to an
          already effective organization. These expectations will frame how
          you present issues to your team and your boss. If, for example, you
          identify significant issues but the expectation is to maintain the
          status quo, you might waste considerable time and energy trying to
          convince your boss and team about the importance of some
          problems.</p><p>Your timing on addressing long-term issues is also critical.
          If, for example, you wait six months or more to discuss big-picture
          issues, your challenge might be greater: You might have lost an
          opportunity to present a fresh perspective or even to identify the
          problem, as it can be difficult to recognize flaws in a system once
          you become immersed in it. Later on, you might find the development
          team more resistant to change, as people might be willing to listen
          to fresh perspectives only from a new manager.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e424"/></p><p>If you propose significant changes, speak credibly about the
          benefits and the costs to the company. "Selling" your changes can
          help you avoid <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0012"/>making enemies or facing inappropriate behaviors from
          others who might be resistant to change.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="collecting_information"/>Collecting Information</h2></div></div></div><p>Collect information about the company's product, people, and
          process to decide on a strategy for your first three to six months
          on the job. Talk with your boss and spend time with direct reports
          and peers to gain a broad perspective on the company. Your goal is
          to get a big picture view of the company's problems and successes
          and to learn how development can best serve the company. Begin by
          asking the following open-ended questions to identify and isolate
          major concerns:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0013"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What is working well?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What do you see as major problems?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What solutions do you propose?</p></li></ul></div><p>Then pull what you learn into a summary and look for
          patterns.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="creating_a_discussions_summary"/>Creating a Discussions Summary</h3></div></div></div><p>As you meet with co-workers, managers, and other staff, take
            notes; then type up your notes into bulleted statements to keep
            the ideas organized and fresh in your mind. Paraphrase and
            summarize comments to make your statements short and
            succinct.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0014"/></p><p>Next, organize the summary document by categories. Each
            category can include problem areas as well as successes. After
            each of the problem areas, list a solution that was identified
            during your conversations. Here is a list of potential categories
            in which to collect information (of course, your list might look
            different):</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Technology</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Quality problems</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>People</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Internal documentation</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Organization structure</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Risks</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Clarity of goals</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Customer service</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Policies</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Marketing and sales</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Process</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Financial issues</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Planning</p></td><td style=""><p>Other</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Problems and solutions will fall <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0016"/>into three categories: issues you and your team can

            departments and people in the organization, and issues that you
            can influence but not directly address. Label each issue
            accordingly in your summary.</p><p>A snippet of the final document might look like this:</p><p>4. Technology</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Positive: Our technology is faster and more reliable

            identified. Ranking successful approaches as well as problems will
            allow you to think about how to keep the most important positives
            strong. A simple <span class="emphasis"><em>A, B, C</em></span> prioritization works
            well for the initial sorting, and it's a good idea to follow this
            system within each level. Rate your boss's statements high, but do
            not minimize others' feedback. Ultimately, you must decide which
            areas to address and how to address them. Create an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0017"/>action plan from your highest priority items.
            Estimate what you can accomplish in the next three to six months,
            for example. A realistic plan will help you avoid tackling too
            many tasks at once and getting little accomplished.</p><p>Make sure you understand the acceptable mix of project work
            versus improvement work before creating a plan. For a small firm,
            spend at least 10 to 20 percent of your time and 5 to 10 percent
            of the team's time solving issues that do not deal directly with
            completing current projects. Such non-project issues include
            improving productivity, conducting training sessions, advancing
            technology, planning for the future, improving working
            relationships, and resolving people issues.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0019"/>Action plans fail due to lack of company support, so
            be sure to solicit the support of your boss in your improvement
            efforts. You need your boss's enthusiastic support—or at least
            acceptance—if you hope to succeed. If your boss reacts negatively
            to your suggestions, you need to try to understand his
            concerns—or, if you still believe in your proposals, do more
            research and selling. Your boss needs to know that you are
            addressing company problems in a reasonable way before your
            approach can be successful.</p><p>You should also engage with other department managers,
            especially in marketing and sales. They'll need to understand why
            time and resources are required for work not directly related to
            their short-term goals. Explain the long-term benefits your
            changes can provide to the company. Since problems you identify
            might not relate to your department only, feedback and discussion
            with others will improve your understanding of the scope of
            problems and help you find the best solutions.</p><p>Establish each effort as a project with a timeline and
            resources. Encourage the continuation of improvement projects or
            they will lose momentum; failing to improve leads to lower
            productivity as the company grows.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="getting_an_overview_at_my_company"/><p class="title"><b>GETTING AN OVERVIEW AT MY COMPANY</b></p><p>When I joined my last company, I made time to talk to a

          reveal information. They can express this in the following
          ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Claiming to be too busy to answer your questions</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Providing only minimal information with important details
              left out</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Claiming not to know an answer, even when you believe they
              do know</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0023"/>Providing extensive low-level details without
              providing context for the information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Leaving out technical details intentionally</p></li></ul></div><p>These claims appear to close the door to getting the
          information you need. To overcome this, you need to understand the
          real reasons behind them. These are some common reasons for people
          being reluctant to provide information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The person's ego requires him to know more than anyone
              else.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>He is worried about job security and wants to hold on to
              critical information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>She is embarrassed by her lack of knowledge.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>He is busy with work and sees little value in educating
              you.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>She does not like or trust management in general.</p></li></ul></div><p>Politely persisting in your requests for information usually
          works. In all cases, explain your interest in the information to
          build trust, but insist that the engineer provide the information
          without excessive delay. Make the following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You need to understand the technology and choices to work
              effectively with the engineer and with others.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You need complete information in some areas, not a cursory
              overview. If the engineer pleads lack of time, discuss his time
              commitments. You can request some overtime efforts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If an engineer's answers seem incomplete or ill-formed,
              ask the engineer to research the topic and report back to you.
              This shows your confidence in this person and the importance of
              your request.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the person really does not know an answer, ask her to
              tell you so directly. Ask who would know the answer. If you
              cannot get the information from that person, assign another
              engineer to get it for you.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tell the engineer that you will be making decisions that
              affect his job, and those decisions should be well
              informed.</p></li></ul></div><p>Hostile engineers will require winning over—or, in the worst
          case, weeding out. Take time to understand the person and his or her
          motivations before acting. Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. MANAGING A DEVELOPMENT TEAM">Chapter 2</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. CREATING AN EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TEAM">Chapter 3</a> go into more

            people interact with each other and what types of behaviors are
            rewarded by management. To identify the company culture, observe
            what managers say compared to what they do. Reading the corporate
            values and mission statement can also help. You can determine how
            mission and values affect corporate direction by discussing them
            with peer managers; you should understand how management applies
            these resources to their staff and work decisions.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-1"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If your boss did not discuss company values

            values and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0024"/>mission statements carefully. These statements
            provide a foundation upon which the company culture is built.
            Management must train employees in the mission and values during
            orientation, and management should review major decisions that are
            not in line with these statements. Because of the rapid changes of
            a small and growing company, mission and value statements are even
            more important than they might be at a large and established
            company.</p><p>In a well-run company, the values and mission statements
            define the company. People make decisions based on defined values,
            which are also used to set company direction and define the
            organization. For example, a key value of
            <span class="emphasis"><em>quality</em></span> would direct the CEO to give the
            quality assurance team a prominent spot in the organization and to
            emphasize quality training. As the development manager, consider

        feedback. They can spot problems and provide suggestions for
        improvement. Correcting and refining <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0030"/>process diagrams often requires several rounds of

      <span class="emphasis"><em>chief technology officer, vice president of

      connect the CEO and members of the executive team directly to your

      ways that differ from those of a development manager in a large
      company.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="understanding_your_core_management_value"/>Understanding Your Core Management Values</h1></div></div></div><p>Before delving into the mechanics of managing a team, let's take
        an introspective look at what it takes to be an effective manager. Ask
        yourself how you want to work with your development team and how your
        core <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0048"/>values affect how you interact with others. Your respect
        for others, ethics, coaching and listening skills, ability to provide
        feedback, and concern for the success of others all affect how you
        make decisions.</p><p>As a manager, you need a "toolkit" of approaches you can access
        when working with your team. Your toolkit should include methods for
        motivating people, making yourself available, choosing the team's
        tools, organizing the team, setting up the workspace, managing
        projects, resolving conflict, and communicating with your team. With
        multiple tools and approaches on hand, you can select the best tools
        for the job.</p><p>In contrast, a rigid manager might have only one tool—the one he
        used at the last job at the last company. But as the saying goes,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>If your only tool is a saw, then the solution to every
        problem is to cut</em></span>.</p><p>The following sections consider the key tools and components of
        a set of core values: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0049"/>trust, flexibility, sincerity, confidentiality, respect,
        and empowerment.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="trust"/>Trust</h2></div></div></div><p>Companies with an environment of trust are the most
          productive, because workers do not waste energy on politics,
          pointing out others' mistakes, or guarding their backsides. These
          companies encourage direct communication—employees trust management
          and each other to pass on correct information and get support for
          their work. This fosters high worker morale, as workers focus their
          energies on being productive instead of on being wary.</p><p>Employees at small companies must be able to believe what they
          hear from senior management, because working at a small firm can be
          riskier than working for a large company. Since small and growing
          companies often lack significant resources, a high-trust environment
          drives the efficiencies that are essential to success.</p><p>Employees at companies with <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0050"/>low-trust cultures waste energy focusing on other
          people's mistakes and protecting their positions. Workers believe
          they need to double-check the veracity of all statements from
          management. In such companies, management perpetuates low-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0051"/>trust cultures by rewarding low-trust behavior, such
          as political maneuvering, public verbal complaints about others,
          rumors, power plays to force decisions on other teams, and
          backstabbing. Low-trust cultures tend to breed in companies at which
          people are worried about losing their jobs. Management is often
          authoritative and political. Senior managers spend their energy
          pulling other people down to pull themselves up. In the absence of
          focused positive effort by top management, short-term advantages
          exist for individuals who exhibit <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0052"/>low-trust behaviors to advance their position.</p><p>Why don't more companies create high-trust environments?
          Building trust requires that management make a focused effort by
          discussing company <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0053"/>values and core beliefs every day and not just at
          yearly reviews. A high-trust culture requires that managers hire the
          right people, train them in company culture, and model the behaviors
          they expect.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="last_one_standing"/><p class="title"><b>LAST ONE STANDING</b></p><p>Our QA team consisted of six engineers, and we were good at

            without management experience. Our team was willing to give him a
            chance. However, over the next four months, he managed to alienate
            all of us by showing no interest in quality. Gradually, the other

          development team members who break your trust. For example, if a
          team member reports to you that she has completed a task, you expect

          the team. Instead, she acts in the interests of both her team and
          her company.</p><p>Trust can appear to be an abstract concept. The following

          trustworthy fashion; being <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0062"/>flexible in how you treat your team will help you
          build a high-trust environment. Treat members of the team as you
          would like your boss to treat you. Focus on individual successes as
          well as team successes. Developers are not just hired hands, but
          people with a career and a life outside of work. If you are fair and
          honest in your approach with them, they will generally treat you
          fairly and honestly in return.</p><p>You can show flexibility when a team member encounters
          problems or life situations that make it difficult for her to work
          in the usual ways. Flexibility in such a situation might mean
          allowing her to work from home for an extended period or allowing
          her to take time off. Flexibility can also mean shifting a person's
          working hours or shifting weekday work to weekend work
          short-term.</p><p>You can also demonstrate flexibility in making work
          assignments, making adjustments to align required work with the
          desires of individual team members. Each developer would then be
          able to focus on particular tasks that are of interest to him or
          her; this improves team members' morale and usually provides
          valuable cross-training that does not occur if individuals focus on
          the same areas repeatedly.</p><p>Flexibility does not mean providing the same solutions to all
          team members, whether or not they have a problem. For example, if
          one employee has family issues that require him to work from home
          for a week, everyone on the team should not then be allowed to work
          at home. When an employee will be working remotely or at hours that
          differ from those of the team, tell your team about the
          accommodation to help them <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0063"/>understand your decision. Of course, in some
          circumstances, you should leave the accommodated employee's details
          vaguely defined, because telling others the details would be
          inappropriate.</p><p>A manager's flexibility has an impact on all the other core
          management areas. An employee is more likely to trust a manager who
          shows flexibility when the employee is experiencing a situation that
          makes it difficult to complete work as usual.</p><p>Some employees might take advantage of your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0064"/>flexible approach, but having an employee take
          advantage of you occasionally is better than being totally
          inflexible. While a few individuals might be untruthful about their
          circumstances, most people are honest.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sincerity"/>Sincerity</h2></div></div></div><p>Your team members will appreciate your sincere concern for

            freeze hiring and we would have to spend money carefully until
            business picked up. A week later, all the company managers
            received Mercedes leased by the company. When asked at the next
            company meeting why this occurred, the CEO explained that senior
            executives had previously had a "car allowance" that the
            accountants said was not tax-deductible. So management leased the
            cars instead, and they happened to arrive right after the budget
            cuts. When asked why he did not cut this expense, his response was
            that this type of incentive was necessary to retain top management
            talent.</p><p>—Hardware engineer</p></div><p>If your actions show that you are insincere, it doesn't matter

          you will not be trusted, and you'll be far less effective as a
          manager, which can lead team members to undermine you. Your team
          will lose focus on achieving the best results for the company.
          Consider, for example, the case of an unprofitable company that
          makes budget cuts. After the manager asks his team to save money and
          spend only on essentials, he purchases a new computer system for his
          desk, even though his current system is fairly new; this manager
          would probably lose his team's respect and ruin his

          manager, she expects that the information will not be shared with
          others or used inappropriately. Unless a confiding employee commits
          a serious ethical breach, violates laws, or puts the company at
          risk, you should never share this information or use it against the
          person. By encouraging an environment in which people can confide in
          you, you can help resolve problems rather than allowing them to
          grow.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0068"/></p><p>Consider, for example, an employee who tells you that she
          wants to work on a different type of project. She has spoken with
          other companies about potential employment. On hearing this
          information, some managers would immediately lay off the employee or
          reassign her to unimportant tasks—because she is leaving anyway.
          However, since the employee has voluntarily revealed this
          information, it shows that she trusts you, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0069"/>and, in fact, she might not really want to leave—she
          might be giving you an opportunity to change her project assignment.
          If she does decide to leave the company, she will likely give you
          time to transfer her responsibilities to others because she trusts
          and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0070"/>respects you.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="respect"/>Respect</h2></div></div></div><p>Individuals on your team must be treated with respect, by you
          and by other developers and co-workers. Lack of respect can be shown
          overtly—for example, when someone verbally demeans another person
          face-to-face or behind the other's back. It can also be shown in a
          subtle way, such as when someone belittles another person by
          demeaning his or her qualifications, skills, or abilities to
          others.</p><p>If one member of your team demeans another, pull the abuser
          aside and talk to him. Don't wait for the situation to "work itself
          out." Depending on the extent of the problem, you might need to
          involve human resources.</p><p>Build respect by creating a team environment that focuses on
          solving problems, not pointing out other people as problems.
          Encourage staff to work out problems individually, and offer

          paces, viewing work as an acceptable task in exchange for pay. They
          know that the tasks required by management are sometimes inefficient
          or useless, but they believe they are unable to change the way
          things are done. Management treats them like plumbers hired to clean

          Boundaries define reasonable limits but are never such sacred cows
          that they cannot be discussed or changed. Clear <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0074"/>boundaries and flexibility to choose a solution will
          prevent workers from feeling micromanaged.</p><p>The following are examples of types of boundaries:</p><p><span>Project constraints</span> Schedules,

        and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0077"/>people topics. Project work includes development efforts
        to create revenue, projects to reduce risk, and strategies to improve
        productivity. People topics include coaching, training, correcting,
        answering questions, resolving concerns, discussing long-term
        problems, discussing new ideas, assisting with work needs, and helping
        with career planning.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1311"/></p><p>Too often, management focuses only on project work, addressing
        current practical issues that drive the company's short-term success.
        However, failing to address other issues when communicating can lead
        to long-term failures that result in decreased productivity, increased
        staff turnover, quality problems, missed opportunities, and morale
        problems. Spend at least a fifth of your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0078"/>communication time on efforts not tied to current
        projects. Consider a communication approach for project topics that
        differs from the tack you take for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0079"/>people topics; each needs its own venue to ensure that
        it is properly covered. The following sections discuss approaches to
        communicating with your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0080"/>team, including <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0081"/>one-on-ones, project communication, team meetings, and

          managers the best opportunity for covering most people topics. (In
          contrast, team building requires team meetings to develop
          relationships and improve interactions.) If your team is larger than
          six people, you might need to limit <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0082"/>one-on-one meetings to every other week because of the
          time involved.</p><p>One-on-one meetings can provide opportunities to build trust
          and listen to each individual's concerns. Let the employee direct
          the initial discussion. Try to avoid discussing current tasks and
          status issues at the beginning of the conversation. Sometimes
          developers will not be forthcoming with information, so you can help
          get them started by asking questions such as these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Do you have any concerns about your work?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Have you experienced or noted any problems

          offering advice, agreeing on solutions to problems, and sometimes
          assigning a task or requesting a solution to a problem. Make
          assignments clear, but avoid spelling out the exact details of the
          solution. Instead, establish agreement on what success looks like:
          Give the employee the authority to solve the problem, and offer
          advice. In general, don't immediately assign the task of problem
          resolution to the person who brought it up. If you make a habit of
          doing this, your staff will bring fewer problems to your
          attention.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="not_listening"/><p class="title"><b>NOT LISTENING</b></p><p>Early in my career, I had a boss who was a poor listener.

            He would issue orders before I was fully able to describe the

          to discuss status until after you have covered the other topics. If

          the release cycle. With short release cycles, <span class="emphasis"><em>daily
          stand-up meetings</em></span>—15- to 20-minute meetings in which all
          participants stand—can be appropriate. The manager structures the
          meetings at the same time each day, asking participants to offer
          brief statements that describe what they did during the previous
          day, what they plan to do today, and any immediate help they
          require. Stand-up meetings are not intended as problem-solving
          meetings or topic discussions. Instead, any identified problems can
          be assigned to individuals for resolution and follow-up.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0085"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0086"/></p><p>For projects with long release cycles, <span class="emphasis"><em>weekly
          project status meetings</em></span> combined with visiting and
          talking with people at their desks can be helpful. This weekly
          meeting usually lasts 30 minutes to an hour. Status and schedule
          meetings usually involve some detailed discussions, along with plans
          for the next few weeks. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0087"/>team identifies risks and the project manager assigns
          individuals to work toward mitigating those risks.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0088"/></p><p>You can communicate project status to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0089"/>team via intranet/wiki postings, emails, whiteboard
          messages, or reviews during regular status meetings. Some <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0090"/>team members will not know the full project status or
          will be unaware of recent changes to the project or schedule. Not
          communicating the overall status to the team can lead to confusion,
          while clearly communicating this information improves morale and
          likelihood of project success. If you provide your team with regular
          status updates, they will be more likely to point out problems and
          discrepancies early on, and they'll also be more likely to get their
          status reports to you on time.</p><p>When communicating project status to the team, scale the
          content and frequency of the report to the size of the effort. The
          status description should include information about projects that
          have been recently finished, which projects will be tackled next,
          any product functionality that has changed, projected completion
          dates as of today, problems encountered, and current identified
          risks.</p><p>On-time project completion depends on accurate status
          information that allows time for the team to make midcourse

          team cohesion and team performance. Team meetings can occur every
          week or every two weeks, depending on the team size. The meetings
          can serve as forums for discussing general concerns or as
          opportunities to provide training on new processes and policies.
          Team meetings also allow team members to discuss concerns or ask
          questions.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0091"/></p><p>Meetings should not be ad-lib events, however, so you should
          prepare an agenda or list of topics in advance. Open a file on your
          desktop and keep it open, adding items as they come up; this file
          becomes the basis for the next meeting's agenda. An established
          agenda will help keep the meeting short and help avoid rambling
          discussions. Circulate the agenda in advance for an even more
          effective meeting.</p><p>Overly long team meetings drain energy from the team and
          impact your bottom line, so keep them as short as possible. Long
          team meetings are expensive, too—for example, a meeting that lasts 2
          hours for a team of 12 takes the same amount of time as 3

          questions and review them weekly with the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0092"/>team, even if you do not yet have answers. Make sure
          you provide ongoing status of open items raised at earlier
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0093"/>team meetings and work toward closure of issues and
          questions.</p><p>Occasionally, a disgruntled engineer can use a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0094"/>team meeting as a complaint session. If the engineer
          crosses the line from constructive suggestions to destructive
          complaining, cut the conversation short and ask him to meet with you
          individually to discuss his concerns.</p><p>Regular development team meetings are not good venues for
          detailed technical discussions. Set up separate technical meetings,
          during which you can focus on specific topics, and make most of
          these meetings discretional, so that people who do not need to
          attend can opt out. Otherwise, engineers not affected by the
          specific technical topics will end up spending time listening to
          discussions that are not helpful to them.</p></div></div>

        their manager, you should encourage them to resolve disagreements
        directly, rather than let disagreements impede cooperation. Typical
        disagreements concern such issues as technology choices, common
        resource usage, or inconsiderate behavior. Team members can usually
        work out technology and resource disagreements directly or sometimes
        through a moderated discussion, but inconsiderate behavior requires a
        different approach.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0095"/></p><p>Problems between co-workers can build up to a point at which the
        people can no longer work together. If one person is angry at another,
        counsel the aggrieved party to ask the other person to meet in a
        conference room to discuss the problem so that a solution can be
        proposed. If they cannot resolve their differences, you can arrange a
        joint session to talk through the problem. However, if a conflict
        involves unprofessional behavior, intervening first can work best:
        Pull the individuals aside at the start and discuss the details of the
        situation with resolution as the goal.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1483"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1488"/></p><p>Occasionally, conflicts occur between members of your team and

        individuals to talk about the issue first. Offer to assist if they
        cannot resolve the issue or if emotions are running high.</p><p>When assisting to resolve a difficult <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0097"/>conflict, first speak with each person involved to
        understand both sides of the issue. Reconstruct the events in a
        timeline. Then call a review meeting with the participants and their
        managers, as appropriate. Present the factual events causing the
        conflict without making judgments. Ask the parties to consider what
        they can do differently to improve the situation the next time it
        occurs. Add your recommendations, if necessary.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="acting_to_resolve_conflict"/><p class="title"><b>ACTING TO RESOLVE CONFLICT</b></p><p>A project manager and her boss told me that they were unhappy

        to technology, self-management, and work habits.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0100"/></p><p>In general, engineers have based their careers on technical
        knowledge and respond positively to technical training. Technology
        changes so rapidly that much of the raw technical details in use today
        will become obsolete in a few years. Consequently, most engineers try
        to keep abreast of leading-edge technical knowledge, and this makes
        training an important aspect of work life. While technology training
        benefits engineers in the short term, general <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0101"/>work skills training can have long-lasting positive
        effects on their careers. For example, learning time-management skills
        will make an engineer more productive regardless of what technology he

        they enjoy their work. Adding a little pressure to achieve reasonable
        goals will add to their overall success. If an engineer participates
        in establishing <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0113"/>and committing to project content and delivery, he or
        she will feel motivated and enjoy the effort.</p><p>If engineers are encouraged and enjoy their work, many will want

        kind of work they enjoy most and create those assignment opportunities
        with realistic, attainable goals. Empower team members by involving
        them in estimating the work effort and delivery dates. Listen to and

        directly to the person. Alternatively, you can show appreciation by
        personalizing a reward. Reward traditions vary considerably company by
        company, so consider these traditions when deciding on <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0119"/>rewards. If your company does not have a reward

        inappropriately or who is difficult to work with—a "problem employee."
        Perhaps you inherited this person from the manager who preceded you,
        he might be part of a reorganization, or you might have hired him.
        Even though small companies cannot afford employees who are not good
        workers, you can and should make a good faith effort to improve an
        employee's problem behaviors.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0120"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0121"/></p><p>You might be tempted to delay dealing with a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0122"/>problem employee because you have so many important
        tasks to do. However, procrastination just allows more time for the
        problem to grow and affect other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0123"/>employees. Instead, as soon as a pattern of poor
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0124"/>performance emerges, you should deal with the employee's
        problems.</p><p>Two categories of problems are common: employees who perform
        poorly and employees who disrupt the team with their poor <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0125"/>attitude. A poorly performing employee will not deliver
        work on time or accurately communicate about his or her workload. An
        employee with a poor attitude has negative or condescending
        interactions with other employees or continually disparages the
        company. Like acid, this person will eventually corrode team cohesion
        and your ability to manage the team.</p><p>Start the correction process by talking to the employee about
        what you observe and try to determine the source of the issue. A
        number of reasons can exist for the employee's actions, including the
        following: The employee might need additional training but is afraid
        to ask; the employee might have a short-term personal problem and
        needs schedule flexibility to resolve it; the employee might need some
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0126"/>coaching on how to be effective; or the employee might
        be unhappy with his or her work assignment.</p><p>Depending on the problem, you can work directly with the
        employee to offer coaching. However, if the employee insists that no
        problem exists or behavior explanations appear inadequate, he or she
        will probably not respond to your coaching. In such a case, you will
        need to move more rapidly to a formalized performance improvement
        plan.</p><p>When coaching an employee, start by agreeing on specific actions
        that would improve his or her work; this will provide goals and an
        impetus to improve. Then monitor progress and offer periodic progress
        reports. To keep coaching positive and not punitive, encourage the
        employee to perform well rather than only pointing out mistakes. If
        you describe what success looks like from your perspective and
        emphasize the importance of the worker's efforts to the company, he or
        she will be more likely to take the coaching as a positive
        opportunity.</p><p>If the employee's performance does not improve over the next
        month or you note a failure to make a reasonable effort to improve,
        you should consider additional measures, such as a formal improvement
        plan. The timing for when to formalize an improvement plan varies
        depending on the situation. Put the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0127"/>employee "on notice" that his or her actions can lead to
        termination. Although some managers will fire the worker without a
        plan, you should create a plan to offer a fair opportunity for the
        employee to change and to provide some protection for your company
        from legal action.</p><p>Requirements for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0128"/>performance plans vary. Talk to your company's human
        resources group to understand its requirements. A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0129"/>performance improvement plan should define specific
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0130"/>problems, spell out the problem behavior as well as what
        success looks like, and describe the consequences of failure. In
        general, use no more than a 60-day review period for the plan.</p><p>Do not assume that performance plans automatically lead to
        dismissal. Although some <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0131"/>employees will fail or will leave a company on their
        own, some will make an honest effort to improve and will succeed.

        for results or discuss a problem. In fact, an annual review is not the
        place to bring up problem behavior. Waiting for the annual review to
        offer an employee negative feedback is a poor but common management
        practice that usually stems from a manager's desire not to confront
        the individual about a problem until forced to do so; this contributes
        to a low-trust environment, however. Though the annual review process
        usually forces the confrontation, most employees will feel blindsided
        if the first they hear of an issue is in their annual review. An
        annual review should reveal no surprises.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0132"/></p><p>Companies handle annual reviews in a variety of ways. Many small
        companies offer no reviews, offer annual reviews for everyone at the
        same time, or offer annual reviews based on anniversary hire dates.
        From the company perspective, the review is driven by human resources
        (HR) to support corporate needs—perhaps to ensure that a review is on
        file to avoid potential lawsuits, especially if the person is
        terminated, or to reward people for good work so that they will
        stay.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e1940"/></p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_the_review"/>Creating the Review</h2></div></div></div><p>Do not wait until review time to collect information or offer
          feedback to team members. Instead, provide feedback all year during
          your one-on-one meetings. You should also collect data throughout
          the year by writing notes in a file about each <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0133"/>employee's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0134"/>performance, rather than trying to remember this
          information at the end of the year. Having your notes at hand will
          make writing the review easier for you and more fair to the
          employee.</p><p>One popular practice is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>360-degree
          review</em></span>. In this scenario, either HR or the manager
          collects information for the review from people working with the
          employee to be reviewed. People in other teams or co-workers can
          usually offer useful insight into the employee's performance. As
          part of the 360-degree review, you should also require a
          self-appraisal from the employee. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0135"/>Self-appraisals are great opportunities for employees
          to list their achievements for the year and judge their own
          performance. Often the self-appraisals will remind you of tasks the
          employee took on months ago that you had forgotten.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0136"/></p><p>A punctual <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0137"/>essay review is the best type of review because it
          covers multiple areas of performance. To write an essay review,
          start by collecting information. Ask the employee to complete his or
          her own version of the review and deliver it in advance of your
          meeting. If the company requires an employee self-appraisal, read it
          first. If self-appraisals are not required, you can still ask for
          them. Write your essay review with descriptions of the employee's
          successes and areas needing improvement. Keep the language
          straightforward and the text relatively short. On completion, review
          each sentence to make sure that it fits in the overall picture you
          want to provide for the employee.</p><p>A general format for the review covers results, successes,
          improvements, and a summary. At the beginning of the review,
          describe in detail the engineer's projects. The earlier notes and
          files for the year will make this task easy. Provide a short written
          discussion of each project, and describe the employee's performance
          and major efforts. Next, describe areas of strengths and weakness.
          Suggest techniques that might help him or her improve performance.
          Propose areas for which the employee would benefit from more
          training. You should also propose goals for the next year. Finally,
          provide a summary describing the employee's overall
          performance.</p><p>You might be required to fill out standard forms for the
          review. This does not preclude you from writing an essay and
          attaching it to the forms, however.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="delivering_the_review"/>Delivering the Review</h2></div></div></div><p>When you deliver the review, discuss each of the different
          areas reviewed. Avoid the temptation to hand the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0138"/>employee the written review at the start of the
          meeting, because he or she will quickly read it and not internalize
          what you are trying to say. Instead, spell out the major points and
          ask questions to determine whether the employee agrees or disagrees
          with your assessments. Give the employee time and encourage him or
          her to ask questions. When reasonable, make the review session a
          positive, uplifting discussion.</p><p>At the end of the meeting, provide a written copy of the
          review to the employee. You might consider scheduling a follow-up
          meeting for the day after the review if it seems appropriate. This
          gives the employee an opportunity to think about the review and
          convey any thoughts the next day.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="providing_late_and_deficient_reviews"/>Providing Late and Deficient Reviews</h2></div></div></div><p>Reviews are important to employees for career and financial
          reasons. Providing regularly scheduled reviews on time is a sign of
          respect. A late review can be demoralizing for an employee who is
          asked to wait. Providing late reviews add to employee anxiety and
          can make the employee believe he or she is neither important nor
          respected.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0139"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0140"/></p><p>The anxiety level is often greater if the review is tied to an
          annual salary increase. A few companies have the abominable practice
          of not backdating raises if the manager delivers the review late. In
          these companies, a manager's delay leads to lost income for the
          employee, so the review is no longer a positive experience; it has
          turned into a negative experience that increases the employee's
          cynicism and destroys his or her trust in the company.</p><p>Delayed reviews can cause other problems, as well. Development
          engineers will let others know of their concerns about the company
          and management. They might assume management is delaying the reviews
          so the company can save money and may thus speculate that the
          company is in financial trouble.</p><p>So why do managers deliver late <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0141"/>reviews? For most managers, writing a review is a
          painful process that they avoid by indefinitely delaying the task,
          not writing anything, or not offering advice during the reviews.
          Many managers ignore the importance of the review to ongoing
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0142"/>employee goodwill.</p><p>Poorly written reviews also have a negative impact on
          employees. Such a review might list only a few bullet points along
          with the HR-mandated evaluation boxes in a few different categories.
          The only review worse than a poorly written review is one that the
          manager did not write at all. If HR requires a review session but
          nothing else, the review can become a <span class="emphasis"><em>handshake annual
          review</em></span>, in which the manager offers the employee a few
          verbal comments along with a raise figure and a handshake.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-2-0143"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="the_handshake_annual_review"/><p class="title"><b>The Handshake Annual Review</b></p><p>I have received a half-dozen handshake annual reviews in my
            career. I usually find them disappointing, as they offer no
            guidance for the future. They also indicate that my manager does
            not want to spend the time thinking about how I really did. The
            reviews were all positive, so I would have liked a written record.
            The record is valuable to me, especially when I have a new
            manager.</p><p>My favorite reviews are upbeat discussions with details and
            ideas for improvement that I can actually act on.</p><p>—Engineer</p></div><p>HR departments can make it easy for managers to write poor
          reviews in several ways. First, the review form can use rating
          checkboxes that allow a manager to assign a numerical value to each
          area. In some companies, the sum or average of the numbers on the
          form constitutes the employee's rating. This approach falsely
          assumes that all the rating items have equivalent value and will
          lead to skewed employee evaluations.</p><p>Some forms have limited space for including information about
          an employee's key attributes. Advising an employee is difficult when
          you are limited to two lines of comments. A reasonable review
          requires full descriptions.</p><p>A minimum standard for quality of the review or feedback is
          often missing. If a manager can produce an acceptable review by
          checking boxes and writing "Good work," the standard is too low. A
          form review can be easy, but it does not serve the company or the
          employees.</p><p>Reviews should be a ceremonial culmination of continuous
          feedback and coaching. Annual reviews are easy to write by drawing
          from the outputs of a yearlong coaching system. Employees spend a
          year of their lives developing software for your company. Condensing
          a person's effort into a short summary of "Good work" and a
          checklist is</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td>☑Unacceptable</td></tr><tr><td>☐Acceptable</td></tr></table><p>on the part of the manager. Instead, use the review to
          reinforce the coaching you provided throughout the year.</p></div></div>

      with fewer wasted resources. An ineffective team builds a weak
      foundation that will crumble when stressed.</p><p>Company management, across the board, must be supportive
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0144"/>of the efforts of the development team to maintain the
      team's effectiveness. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>effectiveness</em></span> can be
      interpreted in many ways. At one company, for example, the top executive
      focuses on engineering costs. But that mentality results with metrics
      such as <span class="emphasis"><em>code per dollar</em></span>—and teams of low-paid
      developers spread across the globe. Development engineers are not
      necessarily effective when they produce the most lines of code in the
      shortest amount of time. Good solutions based on minimal code are the
      deliverables of effective engineers.</p><p>Let's continue this discussion with a good definition:
      <span class="emphasis"><em>An effective team provides the best customer solution per
      company dollar</em></span>. Customer satisfaction, quality, schedule, and
      budget <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0145"/>of project delivery can all be measured over time, and the
      best customer solutions meet the customers' needs and provide
      high-quality products delivered on time and on budget. To convince a CEO
      about effective solutions that require immediate expenses or changes,
      you need to focus on the long-term corporate goals—a quality product,
      delivered on time—and meeting these goals requires an effective
      development team.</p><p>Management should consider four aspects: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0146"/>team effectiveness, team member effectiveness, management
      effectiveness, and effectiveness of team integration within the company.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Team effectiveness</em></span> requires an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0147"/>organization that supports the team's efforts and provides
      solid communication paths. <span class="emphasis"><em>Team member
      effectiveness</em></span> requires a work environment that allows team
      members to contribute their ideas and ensures proper communication
      within the team. <span class="emphasis"><em>Effective team management</em></span> requires
      a manager who looks out for the team and is willing to encourage some
      fun along with the work. Finally, <span class="emphasis"><em>efficient team-company
      integration</em></span> requires a framework for cooperation and
      communication. These aspects are often overlooked and minimized despite
      being necessary ingredients for success.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0148"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="effective_team_organization"/>Effective Team Organization</h1></div></div></div><p>Whether starting a new job or growing a development team,
        development managers should build team organization based on a planned
        size rather than letting the team grow "organically." Ideally, three
        to eight people should report directly to a manager—more than that,
        and you'll probably not have enough time to spend coaching each
        developer. In some companies, more than 20 people report directly to a
        single manager. A manager with 20 reports does not have time to coach
        each individual properly.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch03.html#simple_engineering_team_structure" title="Figure 3-1. Simple engineering team structure">Figure 3-1</a> illustrates
        a simple engineering team structure, showing a manager with five
        direct reports. Each engineer reports directly to the manager for all
        aspects of his or her work.</p><p>As the company grows, the development team grows as well. You
        can support organized team growth by adding either project or
        technical leads or managers along with new development staff.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Technical leads</em></span> deal with the day-to-day
        technical decisions; they provide the technical leadership and
        guidance for the team, usually on a product or associated line of
        products. Technical leads are not responsible for project management
        or general people management. <span class="emphasis"><em>Project
        leads</em></span><sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-3-FNOTE-1" id="CHP-3-FNOTE-1">1</a>]</sup> handle the project management decisions: who to use on a
        project, how to plan the project, and how to deal with change during
        the project. Sometimes a project lead will handle technical
        leadership, but he or she does not take on people management, such as
        conducting reviews, hiring, firing, and coaching.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0149"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0150"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="simple_engineering_team_structure"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2190"/><img alt="Simple engineering team structure" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266061.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 3-1. Simple engineering team structure</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Even if your staff includes a technical or project lead, do not

        coach the staff. <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. SOFTWARE COMPANY STRUCTURE">Appendix A</a>
        discusses <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0153"/>matrix management in more detail and covers how company
        organizational approaches change as the company grows. As a rule,
        every time a company grows by 50 percent, you should evaluate whether
        organizational changes are required, and by the time growth reaches
        100 percent, you should already have made changes to accommodate that
        growth.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0154"/></p><p>For organizations with many projects, a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0155"/>flexible project lead approach can be very effective.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Project leads</em></span> coordinate projects using
        overlapping teams instead of fixed staff assignments. Project leads
        often have technical leadership authority in addition to project
        leadership, and they can be <span class="emphasis"><em>flexible</em></span> because each
        lead usually holds responsibility for only one project. The lead role
        is not a job title. As projects start and end, leads can be reassigned
        to other projects as developers or project leads. As project size
        permits, some leads may share time in different roles between two
        projects. This requires a team with multiple engineers who also serve
        as project leads.</p><p>The flexible approach empowers teams to accomplish individual
        goals instead of being part of a single functional hierarchy. It has a
        large advantage in that the project team assignments can be
        reconfigured as required. This approach also requires separate
        <span class="emphasis"><em>staff managers</em></span> who deal with issues unrelated to
        project work, including staffing, career growth, process definition,

          productivity problem for the development staff. As we were all
          working in cubes, we had no doors to shut, and people would stop by
          all day.</p><p>I purchased several versions of the yellow "Police Line: Do
          Not Cross" tape for team members. By agreement, a busy developer
          would put the tape across his or her cube entrance for no more than
          two hours at a time to indicate that interruptions were unwelcome
          while focusing on code. We asked people in different groups to
          respect this time and interrupt only for true emergencies.</p><p>—Engineering manager<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e2370"/></p></div><p>Although good inter-team development and intra-team cooperation
        necessitates some communication, good communication does not include
        at-will interruptions. Interruptions might be normal for other staff,
        such as sales and marketing workers, who shift efforts constantly
        during the day. In fact, interruptions may not even be problematic
        during some programming tasks, but for most development efforts, even
        short interruptions can cause problems—having to answer the question
        "Is this a good time?" or "Can I ask a quick question?" will break a
        developer's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0163"/>concentration. Most questions lead to discussions and
        resolutions on the spot, as the developer does not want a second
        interruption.</p><p>In some companies, people interrupt <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0164"/>engineers continuously throughout the day. Engineers who
        try to work around and between <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0165"/>interruptions find that they are inefficient and prone
        to making errors. Errors in code lead to more time spent debugging and
        repairing, which increases development costs. Despite a team's best
        efforts in testing and debugging, poorly written code ultimately
        results in poor-quality products released to customers—and this, of
        course, has big sales and support implications that can create a large
        impact on the company bottom line.</p><p>To accommodate all demands, you and your team can actively
        negotiate work habits and communication arrangements within the team
        and with other teams. Consider some systematic approaches to minimize
        interruptions as part of your effectiveness strategy.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Use distinct signs that engineers can use to indicate "do
            not interrupt." In offices, close the door; in cubicles, use a
            sign or banner. An open space layout encourages interruptions and
            impromptu conversations. By agreement, an engineer could place a
            sign on her desk asking for undisturbed time, but this works less
            well in an open office environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Minimize interruptions by providing other venues for work.
            Allow engineers to work away from their desks if you can provide
            no other solutions for uninterrupted work environments. Work
            venues can include a quiet conference room, a coffee shop, or time
            at home to spend part of the day designing and writing code. They
            can use office time for communication, meetings, group
            discussions, or simple tasks such as reading email.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Set up a corporate agreement on non-interrupt time that
            restricts interruptions to specific hours of the day. For example,
            meetings and engineering team discussions could all occur only in
            the afternoon hours; this allows the team a period of productive
            coding time in the morning. This approach works reasonably well if
            the company culture supports it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Allow engineers to occasionally work <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0166"/>remotely, if they prefer it to working in the
            office. Keep in mind, however, that although this is advantageous
            in that it does not require a company-wide agreement, it can lead
            to problems. By working <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0167"/>remotely, an engineer can become more of an
            individual contributor and less a part of the team. When
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0168"/>engineers are away from their desks, fewer team
            discussions occur, and this can have a negative impact on the
            quality of the overall design. It also limits opportunities for
            team interaction, explanations, impromptu design decisions, and
            mentoring.</p></li></ul></div></div>

        development efforts and effectiveness. In an open space layout or a
        cubicle layout, collaboration and conversation are encouraged, which
        can both please and annoy busy workers. Team <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0170"/>conversations, however, lead to better designs and
        closer working relationships. Daily informal design discussions can
        provide a major advantage by encouraging collaboration. Other methods,
        such as having all team members working remotely and collaborating via
        email and telephone, are not as effective.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0171"/></p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-2"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Most engineering teams dislike a completely open

        team; being close by will help you stay informed about progress and
        problems and will help you build trust with your team. An office close
        to the team means you can readily coach others in private and conduct
        confidential conversations. If you are forced to choose between a
        remote office and a cube, take the cube only if you can arrange for
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0174"/>conference rooms to be located nearby where private
        conversation can occur. You need to be able to close the door while
        coaching and correcting team members.</p><p>In a cube or open space environment, multiple conference rooms
        should be located near the development area to provide spaces for team
        collaboration. As you're reviewing space plans, insist on having more
        than two conference rooms. An insufficient number of rooms shared by
        everyone in the company will quickly fill up with standing meetings
        and customer visits.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e2463"/></p><p>Arrange the office space so that quality assurance (QA),
        marketing, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0175"/>technical writing, and engineering teams are located in
        close proximity. This encourages communication between teams, as most
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0176"/>informal <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0177"/>conversations occur within a short walk from a worker's
        desk. Informal conversations among developers and with other teams are
        generally beneficial and collaborative. If developers' only contact
        with marketing staff is through formal meetings, the quality of the
        relationships between members of the two teams will suffer, and so
        will the product.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that developers need sound isolation from
        loud neighbors. Since both marketing and sales team members often use
        the phone and can generate a fair amount of noise, make sure
        engineering space is set up to reduce noise. Consider several
        solutions for keeping the work area quiet:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Rearrange the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0178"/>office space to minimize sound distribution. You can
            reduce noise by installing dividers between noisy <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0179"/>offices and engineering spaces.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Set up developers' workspaces in an area with little foot
            traffic. Talk with other managers before moving the team to an
            isolated spot, however, because the point is to encourage quiet
            thinking time, not isolating and reducing communication. Avenues
            of communication must be clear and a cooperative attitude should
            drive any space decisions you make.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create an impromptu conversation area next to the
            development space. This area can include a large whiteboard and
            comfortable places to sit. If the space has good lighting (such as
            a large window) and a welcoming atmosphere, the team will use and
            appreciate it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ask people to respect others and keep the noise levels down

        the customers and the organization aligned with the work being
        accomplished. The most effective approach for creating successful
        companies and products is for the entire product team (development,
        sales, marketing, QA, and operations) to be able to discuss goals,
        problems, and solutions and then document them together to create
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0181"/>working descriptions and a shared understanding of what
        those descriptions mean.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-3-FNOTE-2" id="CHP-3-FNOTE-2">2</a>]</sup></p><p>Contact among company teams improves the product definition and

        before coding begins, saving time. Development, QA, sales, marketing,
        support, technical writers, trainers, and the customer need to
        collaborate to define the product efficiently and avoid significant
        backtracking later.</p><p>Open <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0182"/>communications between development engineers and QA
        engineers allows QA to ask questions about the intent of the code, to
        create better tests, and to provide better coverage for the system,
        thus improving product quality. It also uplifts QA team morale, as
        they will be taking part in the development effort. In contrast, some
        companies limit QA access to engineering so that programmers can be
        more productive, but QA engineers feel impeded by this situation,
        finding it more difficult to do good work as the importance of their
        role is diminished.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="talk_to_the_hand"/><p class="title"><b>TALK TO THE HAND</b></p><p>My current company completely isolates QA from the software
          engineers. Engineering management told QA that we could not talk
          directly to the engineers to ask questions, and we sometimes must
          wait multiple weeks for information we need to do our job. Our QA
          team is demoralized in general and the quality of our work suffers
          as a result. This is why I am looking for a new position.</p><p>—Unhappy QA engineer</p></div><p>QA team contact benefits engineers as well. QA can provide
        valuable feedback on the design of the user interface, for example.
        Close contact between the two groups during testing will allow
        developers to understand individual defects logged in the tracking
        tool. Defect clarity reduces mistakes <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0183"/>in repairing defects, and improved defect repair
        improves the product schedule, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. UNDERSTANDING QUALITY ASSURANCE">Chapter 17</a>.</p><p>Consideration and scheduling usually improves collaborative
        efforts. Dealing with the conflicting needs of access and excess in
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0184"/>communications with engineering requires that the
        manager define a strategy and get the teams to buy into that strategy.
        For example, to avoid excess <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0185"/>interruptions with development engineers, QA engineers
        could bundle questions to present in an afternoon meeting rather than
        interrupting developers throughout the day with new questions.</p><p>Some managers try to isolate development teams from the other
        groups in the company by putting the team into a "black box." This
        forces people outside the engineering box to "throw requests over the
        wall," while engineering shoves <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0186"/>software back out through a slot in the floor (or maybe
        through a network cable).</p><p>A development manager might build a black box around his team
        with the best of intentions. Usually, he adopts the policy because
        engineers complain that they cannot get work done because of
        interruptions from other departments. Engineers complain the loudest
        when they're behind schedule on a critical project. In response, the
        development manager tells the rest of the company not to talk to
        engineers.</p><p>On the surface, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0187"/>isolating the development team appears to solve several
        management problems—the manager no longer worries about other people
        asking engineers to work on tasks that were not assigned by him, for
        example. However, this approach leads to long-term failure, because
        engineers cannot collaborate with others, and it indicates a lack of
        trust in other managers to manage their teams. The lack of
        collaboration leads to long schedules, poor product definitions, and
        low quality.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e2592"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e2595"/></p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#CHP-3-FNOTE-2" id="ftn.CHP-3-FNOTE-2">2</a>] </sup>See <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. DEFINING THE PRODUCT">Chapter 5</a> for more

        because of her technical and product knowledge. This newly minted
        manager, however, does not instinctively understand her role as a
        manager, but instead sees herself as an engineer who must now endure
        more interruptions and more paperwork. This new manager might in fact
        prefer to continue writing code full time, despite the perceived
        benefits of a management position. Without training and direction, she
        won't embrace her less code-oriented role and will believe that her
        only management responsibility is to answer team questions. The team
        will almost certainly become disillusioned with this manager.</p><p>Delivery pressures compound the new manager's problems. Because
        she sees that another trained engineer would help her team accomplish
        its work goals, she will be tempted to take off her manager hat and
        "be that engineer" for a while. She might assume responsibility for
        building a section of the code and use this assignment as a reason not
        to manage the team. When faced with difficult and unfamiliar
        challenges, new <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0188"/>managers often fall back on what they do well—<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-3-0189"/>software development.</p><p>This problem is more common than it should be. An effective
        development manager needs to focus her energy on management and not
        writing code. Her manager should be aware of her needs and arrange for
        management training and coaching to assist her with the new role. If
        she is not a good management fit, even after extensive training and
        coaching, she should perhaps be sent back into full-time programming
        or another technical leadership role.</p><p>An exception to the "do not write code" rule, however, can occur
        if the new manager can apply her technical expertise to a tiny effort
        on a rush schedule. Such an effort should last only a few days. After
        the manager has written the required code, she should immediately
        train an engineer on the technology involved, so the short-term need
        should not arise again for that technical problem.</p><p>If the development manager with a team of one or two developers
        is effective at management as well as developing code, she might also
        be able to do both jobs. This works best for experienced managers who
        understand how to balance their management time with development
        effort. However, in most cases, a new manager who also works as an
        engineer has a fool for a boss.</p><p>In the end, a new development manager who likes to write code
        can spend personal time working on individual projects. Open source
        projects present great opportunities for working with and staying up
        to date on new technologies. Working on small projects in new
        languages or platforms on her own time can also help the new manager
        keep up with new technology.</p></div>

      hiring process, but you, as the development manager, must take charge of
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>candidate selection</em></span> process to grow your
      development team and company successfully. A company's hiring process
      usually consists of defined steps for opening the position, identifying
      candidates, filling out forms and getting approvals, setting up
      interviews, checking candidates' credentials, and making and approving
      an offer. However, this process does not define the candidate
      <span class="emphasis"><em>selection</em></span> process, in which you decide
      <span class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span> you want. Creating and following a candidate
      selection process is essential to finding the right developer for the
      job.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0190"/></p><p>Because good development teams help small companies succeed and
      grow, your candidate selection process must be a priority. You define
      your team's character by your choice of new hires. Hiring the right
      person at the right time has a positive impact on productivity. Hiring
      the wrong person is painful and costly. A moderate amount of effort in
      hiring the best candidates will yield considerable results.</p><p>Without a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0191"/>candidate selection process, interviewers will likely
      focus on the wrong subjects. Engineering interviewers might judge
      candidates based on only a few issues: knowledge of technologies the
      company is currently using, projects listed on the candidate's resume,
      and the candidate's personality. But focusing on only a few traits
      ignores the importance of other key traits, including the candidate's
      success history, work habits, industry experience, people skills, and
      other general (versus specific) technical abilities. A narrow interview
      focus will result in weaker candidates who possess some technical
      skills, and although you might like a candidate on a personal level, he
      or she might not be a good performer on the job.</p><p>An organized approach to candidate selection requires that you
      define desired candidate traits, the handling of prescreening, the
      approach to the entire interview, and the decision-making process. Keep
      the big picture in mind as you consider the following areas
      systematically.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="designing_a_selection_process"/>Designing a Selection Process</h1></div></div></div><p>Start any engineering hiring activity by designing a selection
        process that outlines the steps you intend to follow as well as your
        approach to making the selection. Reasonable selection steps for a
        small company would start by identifying potential candidates from the
        resumes you have solicited, ideally through your network. Follow this
        with a phone screening of candidates, selecting the most promising
        applicants for office interviews. Next, you'll interview the
        candidates at your facility along with an interview team and convene a
        post-interview meeting to collect information. After these steps, you
        should be ready to make a hiring decision.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0192"/></p><p>At each of these stages, select clear criteria for evaluating
        whether the candidate is a good fit and scale the effort of selection
        to be reasonable. Use effective methods of screening during the resume
        review and phone interview so that the few candidates that you
        interview at your facility are well worth the time spent interviewing
        them. And, most importantly, decide in advance what you are looking
        for in potential candidates relative to the position. To encourage
        this, the next section is devoted to <span class="emphasis"><em>interview
        traits</em></span> that should help you choose the ideal person.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="interview_traits"/>Interview Traits</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0193"/>Start by thinking about what makes a good development
        engineer. Using this information, your interview team can evaluate the
        candidates for these <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0194"/>traits during the interview by assigning different
        interviewers to different traits. For each of the areas, create a list
        of sample questions that you will provide to members of the interview
        team. If you evaluate candidates in all of the following areas, you
        can get a broader picture of the candidate and his or her
        potential:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "> </th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0195"/>Technical skills</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Communication skills</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Success history</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Personality</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cultural fit</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Enthusiasm</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Work habits and preferences</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Problem-solving ability</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Industry experience</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Sense of humor</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>People skills</p></td><td style=""> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Each of the traits requires an evaluation method. Direct
        questions work well for inquiring about the candidate's knowledge of
        the work. A mix of knowledge and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0196"/>behavioral questions can be useful. Answers to
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0197"/>knowledge questions, of course, tell you about the scope
        of the candidate's knowledge, and answers to behavior questions tell
        you how the candidate applies that knowledge.</p><p>Knowledge questions can be rephrased as behavioral questions
        that can reveal the candidate's experience. For example, the knowledge
        question, "How do you prioritize tasks?", can be rephrased as a
        behavioral question: "Describe a project task that proved difficult to
        prioritize and the approach you took," or alternatively, "How did you
        prioritize your tasks on project <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>?" (where
        project <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is a specific project on the
        candidate's resume).</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="technical_skills"/>Technical Skills</h2></div></div></div><p>Technical skills include both <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0198"/>foundational skills and specific skills.
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Foundational</em></span> skills include the candidate's
          ability to program and his or her comprehension of computer science
          basics, while <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> technical skills include
          the languages, programs, and libraries the new engineer will need to
          use immediately.</p><p>Any legitimate candidate must possess the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0199"/>skills required to do the job, and a set of
          skill-based questions can be useful in evaluating candidates.
          Unfortunately, interviewers often give too much weight to specific
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0200"/>technical knowledge when evaluating potential
          employees. Instead, focus on the primary technology knowledge
          required by the engineer and do not over-emphasize secondary
          technologies. Most good engineers can learn new technologies
          quickly, so seeking only candidates who match a laundry list of
          technological expertise will unnecessarily eliminate some strong
          contenders.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="success_history"/>Success History</h2></div></div></div><p>An engineer's <span class="emphasis"><em>success history</em></span> describes
          the engineer's successes with past assignments at other jobs. Talk
          with a trustworthy person who has worked with the candidate in the
          past, asking the following questions:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0201"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What did the candidate do on the project to ensure that
              his work was high quality?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Did the candidate complete his project work on

              arose?</p></li></ul></div><p>If you cannot find a trustworthy source, or even if you have
          spoken with someone, you should ask the candidate the following
          questions during the interview:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>How do you ensure that your work is high quality?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How often was your project work completed on time?

          be a good guide in determining how he will function at your
          company.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cultural_fit"/>Cultural Fit</h2></div></div></div><p>Because every company has a unique culture and corporate
          values, look for candidates who match your company's style and
          values. A person who is looking for a low-key work environment, for
          example, would not fare well in a company of hard-driven engineers
          who work around the clock. An intensively aggressive culture would
          challenge a quiet and accommodating employee. Candidates who fit
          within the company culture will be happier, more productive, and
          more likely to stick around. Candidates who do not fit will be more
          likely to leave the company for other opportunities when they
          realize the mismatch.</p><p>Evaluating cultural fit can be a challenging task. Most
          candidates want the job, so even if you ask them directly about
          their work culture and style, they might tell you what you want to
          hear—that is, what they know about the culture of your company. It
          often works better to ask behavioral questions like these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe the cultures of Company <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
              and Company <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> (companies that appear on the

              the culture that suited you best?</p></li></ul></div><p>After creating a list of cultural fit questions, consider and
          review your company's culture and the questions with your manager
          and with other department managers. They will have useful insights
          and can offer other good questions to ask. Reviewing culture with
          others can also help to keep the culture in alignment across the
          company. <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. WORKING WITH YOUR COMPANY">Chapter 9</a> discusses

          knowledge of the industry (rather than technology and programming
          knowledge). For example, if the company supplies medical software,
          does the candidate understand the medical software field and
          specific regulations? You can evaluate candidates by asking about
          industry information relative to the position.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0204"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="people_skills"/>People Skills</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>People skills</em></span> describe how the engineer
          interacts with others, especially when a conflict occurs. When
          examining a candidate's people <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0205"/>skills, consider the candidate's willingness to
          listen, her openness in sharing information, how she resolves
          conflicts, her ability to take constructive criticism, and whether
          she is flexible with assignments. Questions you might ask about
          people skills include the following:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0206"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Describe a conflict with a co-worker and how you handled

              improving your performance.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe a work situation that required flexibility on
              your part.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="communication_skills"/>Communication Skills</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Communication skills</em></span> describe the
          candidate's ability to talk, listen, write, and present information.
          You can assess her talking and listening skills during the
          interview. To evaluate her <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0207"/>writing skills, ask the candidate to submit an example
          of her technical writing, such as a conference paper (but avoid
          proprietary information). To demonstrate <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0208"/>presentation skills, ask her to present a "chalk talk"
          on a technical topic. Ask the candidate to draw and describe a
          software system; this will give you better insight into how well she
          understands her past work and how well she can communicate her
          understanding.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="personality"/>Personality</h2></div></div></div><p>Consider the candidate's <span class="emphasis"><em>personality</em></span> as
          you judge whether he will work well with the rest of the team. It's
          easiest to identify red-flag areas, such as these:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0209"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Did the candidate not let you get a word in edgewise
              during the interview?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Did he seem a little too chummy, or not friendly
              enough?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Did he appear too eager to please and impress?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Did he have too many negative comments about past

          to decide which of several qualified candidates to hire. This is
          generally a good thing. Although engineers are usually more reserved
          than sales people, for example, a show of enthusiasm for the job and
          company is important. Successful employees are usually enthusiastic
          about their work.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0210"/></p><p>For young companies, employee enthusiasm can be of particular
          importance. Young companies need people who are passionately
          committed to the business's success and not just their own. Later in
          the growth phase, you can hire candidates who are enthusiastic about
          the technology and possibilities but don't quite qualify as company
          "true believers."</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="problem-solving_ability"/>Problem-Solving Ability</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Problem solving</em></span> defines the engineer's
          ability to solve arbitrary dilemmas. Though some problems can have
          little to do with the actual software technology, you can and should
          evaluate the candidate's thought processes while dealing with
          problems. As an engineer encounters new problems outside her current
          technical knowledge, her ability to think through approaches to new
          issues shows her creativity and flexibility.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0211"/></p><p>Ask the engineer about a real and current difficulty your team
          is facing. You can extend this to ask the candidate to step through
          a solution, perhaps including some sample coding for a
          solution.</p><p>Several companies, including Microsoft, have a long history of
          focusing on problem-solving tests during the interview process, as
          William Poundstone describes in his book, <span class="emphasis"><em>How Would You
          Move Mount Fuji</em></span>? (see "Additional Reading" on <a class="xref" href="ch02s09.html" title="Additional Reading">Additional Reading</a>). As the book title suggests, asking
          a person how to move a mountain can get him thinking about how to
          break down a large problem into simpler steps. This book offers a
          good set of general problems and Internet links for finding
          more.</p><p>Giving an engineer an opportunity to address a general problem
          during the interview will reveal several aspects of his
          problem-solving skills. First, it will show how willing he is to ask
          questions of the interviewer. This carries over to how willing he
          will be to ask for help on tough problems. Second, it will tell you
          how he tackles large issues and what skills he uses to resolve
          complicated issues. Third, it will tell you how he reacts to a
          difficult problem that does not have a textbook answer.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sense_of_humor"/>Sense of Humor</h2></div></div></div><p>With all the tasks that engineers are asked to do, do you even

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pulling_it_all_together"/>Pulling It All Together</h1></div></div></div><p>With a list of interview topics in mind, you should find it
        easier to design a selection process based on the most important
        topics. Consider a good candidate's most important <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0213"/>traits as you move through the interview stages—phone
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0214"/>screening, interviews, review sessions, and deciding who
        to hire.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phone_screening"/>Phone Screening</h2></div></div></div><p>A full-day interview, as discussed next, gives the interview
          team an opportunity to evaluate a candidate fully. However,
          interviews usually consume more than a day's worth of engineering
          time per candidate if preparations and reviews are considered.
          Typically, if you're interviewing more than five candidates at your
          facility, you did insufficient screening earlier. Conducting a
          preliminary phone screening (or even a face-to-face lunch screening)
          eliminates overbooking of full-day interviews.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0215"/></p><p>During phone screening, your job is to determine whether the
          candidate will pass the minimum bar. One approach is to make a list
          of each category and add a plus, zero (neutral), or minus symbol
          next to each category based on the quality of the candidate's
          responses. In the end, invite candidates with the most positives and
          fewest negatives for a face-to-face interview. It's a simple but
          effective measurement, and you can use the negative points as
          follow-up topics during the interview.</p><p>The progression of issues to cover during a phone screening
          session might look something like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span>Ask about knowledge of your
            company</span>. A candidate who knows nothing about your company
            gets a minus.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e3130"/></p><p><span>Discuss relevant industry
            experience</span>. Considerable experience is a plus, and very
            little is a minus.</p><p><span>Ask about a work-related
            effort</span>. Focus on efforts for which he was particularly
            successful or proud of the results. Self-motivated candidates
            should generally feel proud of work they have done. If the
            candidate can't point to anything, that should be a warning
            sign.</p><p><span>Ask about a conflict situation and the
            resolution</span>. An engineer who cannot describe a conflict is
            not a good hire—a minus. One who describes a reasonable conflict
            and a positive solution is a <span class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span> plus.</p><p><span>Ask about the depth of technical
            experience</span>. Focus particularly on the areas that are
            important to you. Judge the candidate's experience by how it fits
            your company's needs. An engineer who has worked with many of your
            technologies can usually learn the others quickly.</p><p><span>Assess the candidate's ability to
            communicate</span>. Clear, concise answers during the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0216"/>screening session are a big plus. If the answers are
            too short or long and rambling, it's a minus.</p><p><span>Ask about salary
            expectations</span>. Try to determine whether the candidate is
            widely out of line with your budget and his background. Many
            candidates will be coy about presenting a number, but you can
            usually get a range. If an engineer is looking for a salary way
            above his experience level, it's a minus.</p><p><span>Ask whether the candidate has any
            questions</span>. Any reasonable questions are a plus, while not
            asking any questions is a minus and shows lack of interest or
            preparation.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_office_interview"/>The Office Interview</h2></div></div></div><p>The office interview provides your best opportunity for
          evaluating a candidate. Plan in advance not only what information
          you want to know but how you are going to get it. Discuss this
          information with the interview team to make sure that each
          interviewer is prepared and does not cover identical
          ground.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0217"/></p><p>At least five people, including you, should interview the
          candidate to provide a broad perspective on his or her fit. When
          selecting the interview team, choose people with a breadth of
          experience rather than just depth. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0218"/>Interviewers should represent different interview
          concerns, have good interviewing skills, make a positive impression
          on the candidate, and understand the selection criteria.
          Interviewers should include people from other teams—such as
          representatives from sales and marketing. Variety in the
          interviewers' backgrounds and styles will help make the interview
          process more well rounded.</p><p>When planning the interview schedule, think of the day from
          the candidate's perspective. Keep the interview process from
          becoming an exhausting marathon lasting longer than eight hours.
          Allow the candidate to take a breather during lunch by keeping the
          conversation lighter and less inquisitorial. After all, she needs an
          opportunity to enjoy her meal. Also, ensure that each interview
          lasts about an hour. Half-hour <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0219"/>interviews are worse than ineffective and can lead to
          shallow impressions and poor hiring choices.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="coaching_your_interview_team"/>Coaching Your Interview Team</h2></div></div></div><p>Interview teams need to be coached prior to the interview.
          This helps ensure that team members collect the information needed
          to make a hiring decision. You can also take this opportunity to
          recommend approaches to <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0220"/>selling your company to the candidate. Without
          coaching or encouragement, interviewers may see the interview as
          just another peripheral task to get done so they can get back to
          "real work."<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0221"/></p><p>At your interview coaching meeting, start by describing the
          goals of the interview and the position the company is trying to
          fill. Make sure team members understand the skill levels and
          experience expected for the position as well as your view of what an
          ideal candidate would be like. Without this clarity, interview teams
          may interview for the wrong set of skills.</p><p>Assign specific responsibilities to each interviewer to ensure
          that they get good coverage of the candidate. Each interviewer
          should evaluate one to three different candidate traits discussed
          earlier. So they are prepared to find the information, ask
          interviewers to carefully review the candidate's resume prior to the
          interview and prepare a list of questions. To assist, you can
          recommend questions and interview strategies. You can also ask
          interviewers to take notes and capture quotes during the interview,
          which are especially useful during the post-interview review.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0222"/>interview team members need to plan how they will
          determine a candidate's technical competence. Discuss potential
          approaches to finding this information, such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Ask a candidate to solve a specific code problem using his
              language of choice</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Discuss details of the programming language your team
              uses</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ask for an explanation of a section of code you
              supply</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Request that the candidate identify defects in a code
              snippet</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ask the candidate to suggest improvements to a predefined
              block of code</p></li></ul></div><p>Remind your team that the goal is not to "trip up"
          interviewees, but rather to understand their abilities and approach.
          The questions a candidate asks and those he does not ask during a
          technical interview are very revealing about how effective the
          candidate will be as part of your team.</p><p>The interview session provides an opportunity for you and your
          team to evaluate the candidate, but it's also an opportunity for the
          candidate to decide whether or not she wants the position. More
          importantly, it's an opportunity for you to sell your company.
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0223"/>Selling your company is vital even if you don't want
          to hire the candidate, because regardless of the outcome of the
          interview, the candidate will likely convey her impressions of your
          company to her colleagues. Consequently, you should always keep the
          interview positive and professional.</p><p>At the end of the day, take the opportunity to gather some
          feedback from the candidate. Ask for her impressions of your company
          and the interview process.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="interview_sessions_to_avoid"/>Interview Sessions to Avoid</h2></div></div></div><p>Setting up the interview process is more than scheduling
          meetings. When arranging <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0224"/>interviews, many managers focus on the impact on the
          interviewers rather than the impact on the interviewee. For a
          moment, consider the candidate's perspective and reflect on these
          awkward and intense interview schedules.</p><p>If your company specializes in any of the following negative
          approaches—or "stress <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0225"/>interviews" in general—change your approach to focus
          on more positive tactics that encourage the engineer to want to work
          at your company. The impact of poor <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0226"/>interview strategies is experienced beyond the
          candidate being <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0227"/>interviewed, as he will relay this information to
          friends and others. Who knows—his stories may even end up in a
          book!</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="marathon_or_stress_interview"/>Marathon or Stress Interview</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>marathon interview</em></span> is unusually long,
            typically lasting more than eight hours. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0228"/>Marathon interviews are a form of <span class="emphasis"><em>stress
            interview</em></span> designed to stress the candidate to see how
            he reacts. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0229"/>Stress interviews are especially undesirable for
            software development work, because programmers do their best work
            when they are not overly stressed. Their reactions to stress don't
            produce useful information or useful work; stress simply lowers
            the apparent performance of the candidate. Stressing a candidate
            is also a good way to put your company on the candidate's "I won't
            work for you or let any of my friends work for you either"
            list.</p><p>Keep the length of the interview reasonable, with eight
            continuous hours being the maximum length. Better to schedule a
            six-hour process or split a longer interview into two days, since
            most candidates burn out after six hours and will not represent
            themselves as well.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="a_very_long_day"/><p class="title"><b>A VERY LONG DAY</b></p><p>My longest interview was for a local job reporting to a
              manager in another city. The company booked me on a flight with
              the hiring manager, so we talked throughout the flight. The
              interview was the next day, starting with breakfast at 7 AM. It
              went straight through to dinner and ended at 8 PM—13 hours. Near
              the end of the day, I was very tired and having difficulty
              focusing on the interview.</p><p>—Software engineer<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e3297"/></p></div></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="hit-and-run_interview"/>Hit-and-Run Interview</h3></div></div></div><p>In a <span class="emphasis"><em>hit-and-run interview</em></span>, the hiring
            manager puts a candidate on a five-hour or longer flight to the
            company locale, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0230"/>interviews the candidate briefly, and then
            immediately sends her home with no delay. Often, the reason for
            the strained travel arrangements is to save the company money, at
            the expense of the interviewee. These interviews occur most often
            with larger organizations at which human resources (HR) organizes
            interviews but faces restrictive travel policies and budgets for
            interview travel. This interview shares all the exhaustive
            qualities of a marathon interview, but it also indicates little
            concern for the candidate's time, emphasizes the worst in
            cost-cutting policies, and leaves the candidate with a bad overall
            impression.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0231"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0232"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="flight_to_nowhere"/><p class="title"><b>FLIGHT TO NOWHERE</b></p><p>My remote interview came after I had interviewed
              successfully with the local team. The next step was to interview
              with the remote boss. The company gave me an indirect flight to
              cut costs, but that added four hours each way over the direct
              flight. In addition, they set it up as a one-day trip to avoid
              having to pay for a hotel room. The trip would leave a two-hour
              window in the destination city for the interview.</p><p>The trip required me to get up at 4 am to catch a 6 am
              flight. After the stopover, I arrived in the afternoon local
              time, and the hiring manager delayed the meeting for 40 minutes.
              He interviewed me for 20 minutes and then had me call another
              person for a phone interview. I left two hours after I arrived.
              I took the same double-leg flight home, arriving home after
              midnight.</p><p>This trip told me what I needed to know about the company,

            seemingly normal lunch interview into a stress-and-grace test for
            the candidate. Unlike the other examples, this approach does not
            take much effort to set up. Four or more people conduct their only
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0233"/>interview of the day during lunch with the
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0234"/>candidate, loading it with specific goals and a
            short time limit. Each interviewer proceeds in sequence to ask
            questions of the candidate that require long answers, ensuring
            that the candidate cannot eat. (Bonus points are awarded for
            catching the interviewee trying to take a bite right before the
            next question is asked.)<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0235"/></p><p>With the right intentions, lunch <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0236"/>interviews can be useful and positive. A positive
            lunch interview can uncover the interests and passions of the
            candidate and also helps you understand more about her personality
            and cultural fit. It can give the candidate a mental rest so she
            will not be worn down by the afternoon. Best of all, a friendly
            lunch shows respect for the candidate rather than a focus on your
            company's desire to cram as much as possible into a day.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="review_session"/>Review Session</h2></div></div></div><p>After you incorporate the interview team's input, the
          selection process needs to include a way to get that information
          back to you, the hiring manager. A <span class="emphasis"><em>review
          session</em></span> should occur as soon as possible after the
          interviews take place so that the information is fresh in everyone's
          minds. If team members are unable to attend the session, you can
          talk to them directly prior to the review session.</p><p>To prevent a few individuals from dominating the conversation,
          ask people to write down their assessments for each of the focus
          areas before the discussion starts. Some companies start with a
          quick "thumbs up/thumbs down" evaluation of each candidate to get
          the team's assessment quickly before discussing details.</p><p>Give every interviewer an opportunity to describe his or her
          impression of the candidate. Each has a unique perspective based on
          a particular interview focus. The hiring manager should speak last,
          as your opinion can unduly bias other interviewers from fully
          expressing their opinions, especially if they have reservations
          about the candidate.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e3374"/></p><p>Ask each interviewer to describe his results, top-down: Start
          with the conclusion and work down to more detail. Each interviewer
          should give at least two supporting reasons for his conclusion;
          these reasons should be more specific than "I didn't think she would
          fit in." Then the interviewer can go into details of what he
          decided, ideally, supported by a quote or two from the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0237"/>candidate himself.</p><p>Ask interviewers to answer these questions after they give
          their thoughts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What surprised you about the candidate?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How has the other interviewers' feedback so far disagreed
              with your assessment?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How specific was the candidate in his answers?</p></li></ul></div><p>When you have finished going around the table, if you find
          that some information from interviewers is contradictory, continue
          the discussion, and ask for more supporting information in the area
          of interest. Before you leave the meeting, you should feel that you
          have all the information you need to make the hiring decision. If
          you like the candidate but don't have enough information in some
          area, make a point of setting up another time to talk to the
          candidate again to resolve any open issues. If another meeting is
          not possible, do not hire the candidate.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="making_the_choice"/>Making the Choice</h2></div></div></div><p>As the hiring manager, you decide whom to hire; don't make the
          decision based on a vote by the interview team. The interview
          process should have provided you with the information you need to
          narrow down the candidates and make a good decision. Make offers to
          candidates about which you have no serious concerns, who meet your
          selection criteria, and who you really believe will be a great
          addition to your team.</p><p>Even with a good interviewing process, you can have trouble
          deciding whom to hire. If you are unsure even after completing the
          process, it might be wise to keep looking for the engineer you
          really want. Don't hire someone full time who will solve only a
          short-term problem. Hiring a marginal candidate is rarely a good
          idea, so be sure you're enthusiastic about the person before you
          make that offer.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="hire_in_haste_regret_in_leisure"/><p class="title"><b>HIRE IN HASTE, REGRET IN LEISURE</b></p><p>Early in my management career, I worked for a company whose

            every quarter was alternating between good and bad.</p><p>I was trying to hire an engineer. Each quarter, I had to
            start the approval and justification process, which took weeks.

            candidates would take several weeks. I would bring in several
            candidates for interviews and finally select someone. Twice in a
            row, the whole cycle took longer than a quarter and a new hiring
            freeze was on by the time the interviews were finished. Frustrated
            by the process, I made the mistake of hiring an engineer quickly.
