    This program uses MySQL to store its data, though it also supports the PostgreSQL,
    Access, and Microsoft SQL Server database systems. Major features include an unlimited
    number of forums and posts, multilingual support, private and public forums, a
    template system for design customization, and a forum search utility.

    James Atkinson began work on a forum system for his website in the summer of 2000,
    while he was a college student. He set out to create an open source flat-style
    message board, of which very few existed at the time. Nathan Codding and John
    Abela joined the development team, and phpBB 1.0 was released in December 2000\.
    Development of phpBB 2.0 began in February 2001; the source code was rewritten
    from scratch and released in April 2002\. James Atkinson continues to manage and
    lead the phpBB project with a team of five developers.
