    Foundation (WMF), first introduced to you in [Chapter 2](hw-wkpd-wk_03.html "Chapter 2. The
    World Gets a Free Encyclopedia"), has taken on this role. The Foundation does
    not oversee any project content but instead owns the projects legally and provides
    a central resource to keep the projects' infrastructure, such as the web servers,
    up and running.

- en: Because the Foundation staff is small for such an ambitious venture, most day-to-day
    decisions are still made by the community that has developed around each project.
    The wiki spirit of volunteering does not stop at the individual project level,
    however. Daily work on Foundation-level tasks is carried out by hundreds of people,
    from running elections to talking to the press to helping out with fundraising.
    Foundation volunteers generally come from individual wiki projects and use that
    background knowledge in their work. Perhaps they first contributed to Wikipedia,
    then fanned out to another project such as Wiktionary, and discovered they were
    interested in cross-project or cross-language issues. Much of the discussion between
    community members on Wikimedia's different projects occurs on the *Meta-Wiki*,
    which we'll describe later in this chapter. Its pages are referenced in the style
    [[m:Help]], where the interwiki symbol *m* stands for [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/).
    This is distinct from the Foundation's own wiki, at [http://wikimediafoundation.org/](http://wikimediafoundation.org/);
    the interwiki code for the Foundation is *wmf*. We'll refer to pages on both of
    these wikis throughout this chapter.

    how operational work gets done, and how to get involved. Wikipedia, Wiktionary,
    Wikibooks, Wikinews, Wikisource, Wikiquote, and Wikiversity in all their language
    versions together represent thousands of varied, individual wiki communities.
    A few broad policies apply to all the projects, but central control is mostly
    *ad hoc*; the Foundation is really a federation of projects and activities, bringing
    together everyone who wishes to help with cross-project work.

    the Foundation's announcement, Wales transferred ownership of all Wikipedia, Wiktionary,
    and Nupedia domain names to Wikimedia along with the copyrights for all materials
    related to these projects that were created by Bomis employees or Wales himself.
    Wales also donated the computer equipment used to run all the Wikimedia projects
    to the Foundation. The domain names [wikimedia.org](http://wikimedia.org) and
    [wikimediafoundation.org](http://wikimediafoundation.org) were secured for the
    Foundation by Wikipedia contributor Daniel Mayer. The Foundation logo ([Figure 17-1](#the_wikimedia_foundation_logo
    "Figure 17-1. The Wikimedia Foundation logo")) was designed in 2003 by user:Neolux;
    this logo came in second in an international contest to choose a new Wikipedia
    logo. (The first-place choice, designed by user:Nohat, became the current Wikipedia
    logo, while the third-place choice became the current MediaWiki logo.)

    an encyclopedic mission, a strong community, and core wiki philosophies. After

- en: Constant growth has always been a defining feature of Wikipedia. In Wikipedia's
    first year, over 1,500 articles per month were created; now that number of articles
    is created in a *single day* on the English-language Wikipedia. On August 30,
    2002, the article count reached 40,000; a year later; the article count was 150,000;
    and a year after that, in August 2004, the total count was over 300,000 articles.
    In broad terms, the rate of growth has increased steadily from the project's inception,
    discounting a few technical slowdowns. (Growth may be slowing, however, for the
    English-language Wikipedia, if not for the other projects; early 2007 saw continued
    growth but some flattening of the trend.)

- en: This growth has been technical as well; the initially fairly basic technology
    behind the site, both MediaWiki and the server infrastructure, has required constant
    upgrades to keep up with Wikipedia's phenomenal popularity. The number of servers
    nearly tripled in 2005 alone (the year of the first Wikimania conference, heavy
    news coverage, and the Seigenthaler scandal), from 39 to over 100\. Oldtimers
    on the site still remember the glitches. How slow the site could be! Early on,
    the onsite search was often switched off to improve performance, but edits were
    still commonly lost, in contrast to today's reliability. The number of technical
    staff has always been small compared to the size of the projects; as of early
    2008, all of Wikimedia's projects on hundreds of servers worldwide are run by
    just four paid technical staff with the help of a few volunteers.

    and the style governing articles also changed, and the initial, somewhat primitive
    look-and-feel was incrementally improved. Big advances in editing came with the
    use of sections in articles. The category system was delayed, and lists proliferated
    in Wikipedia's first three years. In the end, categories were enabled somewhat
    casually in 2004, and three haphazard months of category creation ensued, which
    annoyed many people (but this settled down in time).

    social structure has defined itself over time. A preference for very flat hierarchies,
    which still prevails, didn''t stop various classes of Wikipedians from emerging:
    developers and sysops (administrators), which were first defined as classes of
    editors in 2001\. These classes remain limited, however; today, just as in 2001,
    any editor who has worked on the site for a few days has the same content privileges
    as any other editor. Certain community structures also evolved in the first few
    years as the site grew: The process for requests for administratorship, for instance,
    was not set up until 2003\. This community growth was also reflected in the first
    in-person meetups in 2004\. At the same time, the Foundation began fundraising
    to try to keep up with the site''s growth.'

    technical—the development of the article talk page. The very first versions of
    the wiki software had no talk page; comments were left at the bottom of the article.
    In retrospect, separating out the talk page seems like a simple idea: You have
    the article page, for instance [[Goldfish]], and [[Talk:Goldfish]] is the separate
    forum in which to discuss the content of the Goldfish article. The clear division
    of content (always unsigned) versus editorial comment (signed), was actually a
    huge step forward. Separating content debates from the articles themselves led
    to a strong belief that such discussions should be conducted gracefully and certainly
    not in the *flame war* style rampant on most Internet forums. Using discussion
    to work out content and community problems has proved to be a critical part of
    how Wikipedia deals with contentious issues.'

    as policy, whereas others are simply part of the philosophy behind the site—have
    made Wikipedia what it is today. On the content side, the ideas of free content,
    neutrality, and verifiability have been present since the project's first days.
    On the community side, the ideals of civility, assuming good faith, and being
    bold have encouraged large-scale participation in a project with shared and interlocking
    ideals.

- en: Wikipedia has come a long way. Its first seven years have seen the development
    of many millions of articles and the building of a worldwide community of hundreds
    of thousands of active editors. At the same time, Wikipedia has become part of
    the larger Wikimedia Foundation, with hundreds of sister projects and communities,
    each running the volunteer-developed MediaWiki software. The Wikimedia Foundation
    is both a crowd of volunteers doing varied work from locations around the globe
    and in a broad range of languages and an effective, distinctive voice for globally
    distributed, reusable free content, available to anyone.

- en: On March 27, 2008, a few minutes after midnight GMT, Wikimedia announced that
    10 million articles across all language editions of Wikipedia had been created.
    This announcement made a media splash, while another significant milestone a few
    days later, that 100 Wikipedias now have at least 5,000 articles, slipped by without
    fanfare. Wikipedia watchers won't be surprised at the details. Article number
    10,000,000 was on the Hungarian Wikipedia and about Nicholas Hilliard, a painter
    of miniatures during the reign of Elizabeth I. The 100th language to reach 5,000
    articles was Kapampangan, a major language in the Philippines. According to the
    Wikipedia *Signpost* from April 7, 2008, 40 percent of new articles are now coming
    from languages outside the top 10 (by size) language editions of Wikipedia—the
    leading group including most of the languages dominating global communications
    (though not Arabic). Wikipedia as a global project, encompassing both the topics
    and the languages of the world, has become a reality.

    may be one of the hardest to make work. Wikipedia took from earlier wikis the
    post-moderation concept: Allow people to contribute freely and deal with problematic
    content later. That this approach could succeed at all is counterintuitive, and
    even more debatable is whether the approach is feasible as a way to produce quality
    reference material. But surprisingly to many, Wikipedia has succeeded beyond anyone''s
