    selling them. In this wonderful Internet era, online distribution is easy and
    inexpensive. There are two distinct skill sets needed for succeeding at online
    music distribution: being technically adept at creating good recordings in various
    formats for downloading and streaming and understanding the business of being
    a professional artist, which is complex and involves tasks like customer service,
    contracts, and copyright issues. In the first section of this chapter, we’ll learn
    about creating different audio file formats for various purposes, such as lower-quality
    promotional MP3s, streaming audio, and high-quality downloads. In the second part,
    we’ll take a look at the business of being a recording artist, which is trickier
    than being a good musician and recording whiz.'

    that are most practical to use. MP3 supports both constant bitrates and variable

    > **MP3 Files** > **Options** > **Constant** > **128Kbits/sec**. The Options dialog
    gives you a wide range of constant bitrates, from 8Kbps to 320Kbps. Although 320Kbps

    users who don’t care for MP3\. They may prefer the higher quality of Ogg, or they
    may using prefer open source, patent-unencumbered formats. Ogg Vorbis can be streamed
    or downloaded just like MP3\. It delivers high quality at low bitrates and supports
    multichannel surround, while MP3 supports only one or two channels. MP3 is a closed,
    proprietary standard chock-full of messy, confusing patent conflicts. I haven’t
    heard of any of the patent holders coming after anyone who uses an open source
    encoder like LAME, which is the preferred MP3 encoder to use with Audacity, and
    I haven’t heard of any small-time users getting in trouble for distributing their

    nice for music, with one possible drawback: Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling for
    all levels up to 5\. This means that redundancies between two stereo channels
    are combined to save bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of stereo imaging.
    Channel coupling is not used at levels 6 and up. I don’t perceive any gain in
    going above 7, though your ears may tell you differently. Ogg Vorbis support is

    stick with, though nobody will yell at you for experimenting with the others.
    The different settings are different levels of compression, with 0 being the least
    compression and 8 the most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in quality,
    only in how small the files are compressed. A value of 8 takes several times longer
    to encode than 5 with not much additional benefit. Decoding FLAC files that have
    been maximally compressed doesn’t take any longer than ones that have been lightly
    compressed, so the degree of compression won’t affect playback.

    here modern times are not like the olden days of Bulletin Board Services (BBS)
    when thousands of people ran their own BBS servers from PCs in their bedrooms.
    Maintaining a website, hosting your own downloads, and offering streams of your
    work are all feasible for the do-it-yourselfer but are not for the faint of heart
    or the technophobe. Bandwidth is the biggest problem: If you want to house your
    servers in your home, first find out whether you can get adequate bandwidth for
    a reasonable price and whether your Internet service provider will even allow
    you to run servers. Then you are responsible for your own security, software,
    hardware, and system and network administration. It is satisfying to be the boss
    of your own servers, but it does require a lot of skills.'

    need and gives you a good deal on bandwidth. It’s hard to beat a good hosting
    service on bandwidth cost, since they buy in bulk and spread the cost over many
    customers. Then the hosting service handles hardware problems, Internet connectivity,
    security, and backup power. Plans range from free for a basic low-traffic site
    to inexpensive shared hosting (which means one server with a limited amount of
    Internet bandwidth serves many customers) to paying for your own dedicated, unshared
    server. You can get started cheaply and upgrade as you become more successful.

    the software is free-of-cost open source, they probably will. Most hosting services
    rely heavily on open source software because it is free or inexpensive and because
    it is good.

    for accepting payments or a mailing address for checks and money orders. Check
    and money order fraud are rampant to the point that it may not be worth accepting
    either one. PayPal is easy and popular; just be sure you understand its fee structure
    so you don’t get surprised at the myriad ways it nibbles away chunks of your money.
    Google Checkout has lower fees than PayPal and doesn’t have PayPal’s reputation
    for inconsistent, unfair dispute resolution. You can use both, which will capture

    You don’t want to be one of those shops that makes headlines when some teenager
    hacks your customer database and steals all the information. Consider using a

    at Amazon.com ([http://www.amazonservices.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm](http://www.amazonservices.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm));
    it is reputable and reliable, and it posts all of its prices and policies, so
    it’s a good starting point for research and comparisons. Amazon does not directly
    sell independent music but partners with music distributors like CD Baby and TuneCore.

    and other branded merchandise, who is going to pack and ship them and how fast?
    Customer service is everything. It costs at least ten times more to acquire a
    new customer than to keep an existing customer happy, no matter how great your

    requires always-available authentication servers. Already this is falling apart
    after just a few years. Wal-Mart announced in September 2008 that it was going
    to shut down its DRM authentication servers, which meant that customers would
    not be able to play their DRM-“protected” music that they had purchased if they
    tried to move it to a different machine or restore from a system failure. Wal-Mart’s
    remedy was for customers to copy their DRM-“protected” tracks to CDs, which would
    then play anywhere. There was such an outcry that they changed their plans and
    still maintain their DRM servers. Even though they have moved to DRM-free distribution,
    that old DRM baggage is going to haunt them for a long time.

    people get paychecks for coming up with these brainstorms, while we sensible people
    have to scramble for our daily bread. Sony BMG got busted not once but twice for
    sneakily installing cloaked rootkits on Windows computers from “protected” music
    CDs. Not only was this a trespass that would have been criminally prosecuted if
    it were some kid instead of a globalcorp, it opened big security holes in these
    computers. Other brilliant DRM ideas that went over like lead balloons were time-bombed
    music tracks that became unplayable after a certain number of days, attempts to
    count and limit the numbers of copies that could be made, and downloads that became
    unplayable when subscriptions expired. All of these depend on some kind of central
    authorization and control, which to my way of thinking requires unwarranted intrusions
    into our personal business and a level of reliability that few service providers
    can sustain. I have vinyl LPs that are older than me—how long do you think digital
    tracks will survive even without DRM monkeyshines? I can’t fathom the mind-set
    that can come up with these sort of hostile, self-defeating Big Brother tactics.

    have a right to get paid for their recorded works; I don’t think much of the folks
    who say, “Give your recordings away and earn money giving live performances.”
    Apparently they have never performed or created a good recording. I don’t have
    any wisdom to offer except to treat your paying customers as well as you can.
    In real life, and not the bizarro world inhabited by the entertainment industry
    barons, most people will treat you fairly if you treat them fairly and do the
    right thing because it’s the right thing, not because they are forced to.
