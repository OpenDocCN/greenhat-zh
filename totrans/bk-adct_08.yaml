    selling them. In this wonderful Internet era, online distribution is easy and
    inexpensive. There are two distinct skill sets needed for succeeding at online
    music distribution: being technically adept at creating good recordings in various
    formats for downloading and streaming and understanding the business of being
    a professional artist, which is complex and involves tasks like customer service,
    contracts, and copyright issues. In the first section of this chapter, we’ll learn
    about creating different audio file formats for various purposes, such as lower-quality
    promotional MP3s, streaming audio, and high-quality downloads. In the second part,
    we’ll take a look at the business of being a recording artist, which is trickier
    than being a good musician and recording whiz.'

    non-DRM AAC files via FFmpeg. These have the M4A (*A* for audio) file extension.

    that are most practical to use. MP3 supports both constant bitrates and variable
    bitrates. Variable bitrates deliver better quality. Your online distribution sites

    tunes to meet them.

    > **MP3 Files** > **Options** > **Constant** > **128Kbits/sec**. The Options dialog
    gives you a wide range of constant bitrates, from 8Kbps to 320Kbps. Although 320Kbps
    is often touted as CD-quality, it isn’t. Your own ears may tell you differently,

    users who don’t care for MP3\. They may prefer the higher quality of Ogg, or they
    may using prefer open source, patent-unencumbered formats. Ogg Vorbis can be streamed
    or downloaded just like MP3\. It delivers high quality at low bitrates and supports
    multichannel surround, while MP3 supports only one or two channels. MP3 is a closed,
    proprietary standard chock-full of messy, confusing patent conflicts. I haven’t
    heard of any of the patent holders coming after anyone who uses an open source
    encoder like LAME, which is the preferred MP3 encoder to use with Audacity, and
    I haven’t heard of any small-time users getting in trouble for distributing their
    work in MP3 format. Just be aware that it is an issue for some of your fans, and
    there is a possibility it could turn into a problem for you.

    10\. A value of 3 is roughly equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3\. A value of 5 is pretty
    nice for music, with one possible drawback: Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling for
    all levels up to 5\. This means that redundancies between two stereo channels
    are combined to save bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of stereo imaging.
    Channel coupling is not used at levels 6 and up. I don’t perceive any gain in
    going above 7, though your ears may tell you differently. Ogg Vorbis support is

    supports both 16- and 24-bit.")). The default is 5, and that is a good one to
    stick with, though nobody will yell at you for experimenting with the others.
    The different settings are different levels of compression, with 0 being the least
    compression and 8 the most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in quality,
    only in how small the files are compressed. A value of 8 takes several times longer
    to encode than 5 with not much additional benefit. Decoding FLAC files that have
    been maximally compressed doesn’t take any longer than ones that have been lightly
    compressed, so the degree of compression won’t affect playback.

    not be able to play their DRM-“protected” music that they had purchased if they
    tried to move it to a different machine or restore from a system failure. Wal-Mart’s
    remedy was for customers to copy their DRM-“protected” tracks to CDs, which would
    then play anywhere. There was such an outcry that they changed their plans and

    music tracks that became unplayable after a certain number of days, attempts to
    count and limit the numbers of copies that could be made, and downloads that became
    unplayable when subscriptions expired. All of these depend on some kind of central
    authorization and control, which to my way of thinking requires unwarranted intrusions
    into our personal business and a level of reliability that few service providers
    can sustain. I have vinyl LPs that are older than me—how long do you think digital
