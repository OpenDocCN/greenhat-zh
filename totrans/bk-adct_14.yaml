- en: Microsoft Windows users are in an interesting position right now. Windows XP
    is still the most popular Windows version, despite being a Methuselah in computer
    years as it was first released in 2001\. Microsoft has tried several times to
    retire it, but it won’t go away. In July 2010, Microsoft announced an extension
    of support for XP SP3 through April 2014. XP will continue to be a downgrade option
    for Windows 7 buyers for the length of Windows 7’s original equipment manufacturer
    (OEM) life span, which ends two years after the next Windows version ships. So,
    XP is going to be with us for a long time yet.

    It is frugal of system requirements, needing less than 5GB for the operating system
    and service packs, and it runs acceptably with a 1 GHz CPU and 512MB RAM. Put
    it on a dual-core laptop with a gigabyte of RAM, and you have a capable portable
    recording studio.

    was written, audio hardware manufacturers were finally catching up and releasing
    Vista drivers for their products. Audacity 1.3.*x* runs fine on Vista. But Vista
    is a system resources hog, eating up a good 12+GB of hard drive space just for
    itself. Officially, it needs a minimum of a 1 GHz CPU and 512GB RAM for Vista
    Home Basic or 1GB RAM for other editions, but if that is all you have, it will
    feel like slogging through deep sand. It needs a 2 GHz CPU and 2GB RAM just for
    basic chores such as email and web surfing. I recommend a minimum 2 GHz dual-core
    CPU and 4GB RAM for running Audacity on Vista.

    from Vista; it’s more polished, memory management is a little better, User Account
    Control is less annoying, and it boots up a little faster. The Sound control panel
    has a nice extra feature, a Communications tab with simple auto-duck settings

    muting all other sounds when you receive a Skype call.

    distribute recordings in any form that use AAC, but anyone who makes an AAC encoder
    is required to purchase a patent license. Open source encoders get around this

    3.1\. Then Microsoft developed the Windows Driver Model Kernel Streaming (WDM/KS)
    and Enhanced Windows Driver Model (EWDM) drivers for Windows 2000 and newer. Audacity
    supports all of these. For recording more than two channels simultaneously, you
    want sound cards with full EWDM support. Most audio devices claim WDM support,
    but that doesn’t always mean EWDM or WDM/KS, so they may not support recording
    from more than two inputs at the same time.

    with devices that support EWDM or WDM/KS, or compile Audacity with ASIO support
    yourself. To do this, you need the ASIO software developer’s kit (SDK) from Steinberg,
    the company that owns the ASIO driver, and the latest Audacity source code from
    its CVS repository on SourceForge. You’ll also need Microsoft Visual C++ 8, which
    is part of Visual Studio, to compile Audacity on Windows.'

    Studio, it’s pretty simple. Do you need ASIO support in Audacity? No, if you shop
    carefully, you can find recording interfaces with good-quality EWDM or WDM/KS
    drivers. Just having an ASIO driver doesn’t guarantee that a device will perform
    well, because there are bad ASIO drivers. There are also bad EWDM and WDM/KS drivers,
    so do your homework before purchasing anything.

    configures the updates. You can run the updater manually when it’s convenient

    useless and dangerous services. But you should still go through and do a bit of
    weeding. Don’t change anything without knowing what it does; you don’t want to
    nuke essential Windows services. A quick web search on specific services should
    tell you what you need to know about them, especially if they are Windows services.
