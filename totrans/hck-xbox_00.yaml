    and not just because it can play the latest video games. The powerful and cheap
    Xbox has the potential to be used as a PC, an all-in-one media player, or even
    a web server. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of books that can teach a reader
    how to explore and modify modern electronic hardware such as the Xbox. Most electronics
    textbooks are theory-oriented and very focused, whereas real hacking requires
    a broad set of practical skills and knowledge. Also, the few practical books on
    hardware hacking that I had as inspiration as a child have long been outdated
    by the fast pace of technology. This book is intended to fill the need for a practical
    guide to understanding and reverse engineering modern computers: a handbook for
    a new generation of hackers.'

    saying goes, “Given a fish, eat for a day; learn to fish, eat for a lifetime.”
    Hence, this book focuses on introducing basic hacking techniques — soldering,
    reverse engineering, debugging — to novice hackers, whileproviding hardware references
    and insight that may be useful to more seasoned hackers. The Xbox has served to
    educate both the security community and the hacking community: not because it
    is an outstanding example of security, but because it is a high profile, high
    volume product made by a large company whose focus was recently defined to be
    security by its chairman.¹ The Xbox experience shows that building trustable clients
    in a hostile user environment is hard, even for a large, well-funded company.
    One observation is that this risk and difficulty of building cheap, trustable
    hardware clients places an upper bound on the importance of the secret that can
    be trusted to such client hardware. In addition, the Xbox provides a consistent
    teaching example, with almost 10 mil ion nearly identical units out there at the
    time of writing. The similarity of the Xbox’s architecture to a vanilla PC adds
    even more educational value to Xbox hacking, since much of the discussion in this
    book also applies directly to the much broader subject of PCs.'

    hackers following the Xbox. The people who hacked the Xbox and the expertise they
    attained will be relevant long after the Xbox has become a dusty yard sale piece.
    Hence, there is a conscious social focus to this book. I have included profiles
    of a sampling of Xbox hacking personalities. The hope is to inspire people, through
    role models, to pick up a screwdriver and a soldering iron and to start hacking.
    Instilling this sort of exploratory spirit in the younger generations will be
    important in the long run for preserving the pool of talented engineers that drove
    the technology revolution to where it is today. Many of today’s engineers got
    their start hacking and tinkering with ham radios, telephones and computers which,
    back in that day, shipped with a complete set of schematics and source code. This
    pool of engineering talent is essential for maintaining a healthy economy and
    for maintaining strong national security in the computer age.

    Crazy Taxi and Shen Mue buoyed the Dreamcast’s popularity, while Sony’s Playstation2
    launch ate away at the Dreamcast’s sales and ultimately the confidence of software
    developers. Ironically, the quality of the Dreamcast graphics was equivalent or
    superior to quality to early Playstation2 titles, such as Dead or Alive 2, despite

    Dreamcast’s mask-ROM BIOS that allowed the Dreamcast to boot from a standard CD-ROM.
    Nominally, the Dreamcast uses a proprietary format called the “GD-ROM” for game
    distribution. The GD-ROM format cannot be copied using standard CD or DVD burners.
    However, the back door in the Dreamcast’s ROM BIOS enabled pirates to eventually
    create monolithic CD-ROM images of video games that were bootable without any
    need for hardware modification. Who was going to pay for a game when it could
    be downloaded for free on the internet? The resulting rampant piracy diminished
    game sales, discouraging game developers from developing for the console and damaging
    Sega’s business. Six million units sold, and about three years after its launch,
    the Dreamcast was pulled from the market. Now, Sega is exclusively in the game
    development business, and even makes games for their former competitors Sony and

    of curiosity and exploration. There were hardware hackers who took it upon themselves
    to remove the covers from computers to optimize their design (early computers
    were built out of discrete components, so they could be modified in meaningful
    ways with simple tools), and there were software hackers who labored to make the
    most compact and elegant code, since computational resources were scarce and slow.
    There were hackers who explored the ins and outs of the phone system, and those
    who explored the roofs and tunnels of buildings of university campuses. Quite
    often, early hackers engaged in all of these activities. Hackers would share their
    findings or results (hacks) with each other freely, as their rewards were not
    financial, but came from satisfying their intellectual curiosity and from the
    enthusiasm of their peers. As a result, hackers tended to form into meritocratic

    live in San Diego, California, with my wonderful fianceé, Nikki Justis. I recently
    graduated from MIT with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. One of the reasons I
    was selected to write this book about Xbox Hacking is because I discovered and
    published the first known weakness in the Microsoft Xbox’s security system.

    was made better by something I built. I feel it is my obligation to apply my talents
    and return to society what it has given me. I also enjoy the challenge of exploration.
    I want to understand electronics as deeply as I can. Black boxes frustrate me;
    nothing gets my curiosity going more than a box that I’m not allowed to open or
    understand. As a result, I have a fiduciary interest in cryptography and security
    methods.

    satisfying about having a tangible artifact at the end of the day, as opposed
    to ephemeral bits of software code. It may sound a little bit silly, but one of
    my pastimes is taking apart electronic devices and “reading” the circuit boards.
    There is something exciting about the smell of brand new electronics equipment,
    fresh out of their anti-static bags; I think it is the smell of a new adventure
    unfolding. It is inviting, like a stack of blank paper: I wonder what I will do
    with those blank pages. A stack of blank, white paper stands there and challenges
    me to fill it with useful information.'

    old, my father bought an Apple II clone. He bought just the motherboard, so it
    didn’t have a case. I still remember when he first took it out of the box – the
    green circuit board, the shiny chips, and all the colorful resistors and capacitors.
    I wanted to play with it! Curious as I was about the Apple II, I was not allowed
    to touch the motherboard. Of course, this meant that whenever my parents weren’t
    looking, I was taking the chips out of their sockets on the motherboard and doing
    silly things like putting them in backwards to see what would happen.

    electronics experimenter kit from Radio Shack and my first electronics book, *Get
    ing Started in Electronics,* by Forrest Mims, III. These were a great introduction
    to electronics for me, as they satisfied my desire to play with circuits and components.
    My uncle also gave me his old copy of the *Art of Electronics* by Horowitz and
    Hill, along with a couple of books about microprocessors. I subscribed to *Byte*
    magazine, which back in the day included regular columns about hardware projects,
    complete with schematics and pictures.

    the schematics and the ROM listings included in the Apple II user manuals. (I
    stil believe that computers should ship with full schematics and source code.)
    By the eighth grade, I had developed just enough understanding to be able to build
    my own add-in card for the Apple II. The card had a General Instruments SPO-256
    speech synthesizer that I had purchased from Radio Shack. I also added an analog
    to digital converter to my Apple II and wrote an application that turned my Apple
    II into a talking voltmeter. I continued to build hardware, and before I was admitted
    to MIT I had built my own working embedded computer using an 80188 microprocessor.

    building fun little projects, such as a remote controlled light switch and music-responsive
    party lights for my fraternity, ZBT. It was during these years that I was first
    introduced to affordable prototyping services and PCB CAD tools, such as those
    discussed in Appendix C, “Getting Into PCB Layout.”

    although some of my more recent projects have been consulting jobs so I unfortunately
    cannot share those results with the world.

    get my PhD thesis at MIT for hacking the Xbox. Hacking the Xbox was actually a
    diversion from my thesis that was tangentially related, but not central to my
    thesis topic.

- en: My thesis on supercomputers ⁸ focused on an architecture for efficient code
    and data migration. My interest in video game consoles stems from my natural curiosity
    about all hardware combined with the encouragement of my thesis adviser, Dr. Tom
    Knight. Video game consoles represent the pinnacle of performance per cost, and
    cost is a significant issue for supercomputers today. Hence, I was encouraged
    to look at all video game consoles to see what I could learn about building cost
    effective hardware. The fact that the Xbox also had an interesting security system
    was a bonus; since government agencies have a great interest in supercomputer
    technology, the security of supercomputers is always a topic for consideration.
    (In fact, a very interesting paper about building trustable computers⁹ was written
    by colleagues in my research group; I recommend reading it if you are curious
    about alternatives to cryptographically secured trusted computing platforms, such
    as Palladium and TCPA.)

    Significantly, persistence and thoroughness come naturally if you love what you
    are doing. Also, part of being a hardware hacker is being a pack rat. Buying new
    equipment is prohibitively expensive, so I accumulate broken and depreciated equipment
    and tools habitually, even if I don’t know exactly what I might do with them,
    or if I can fix them. It turns out that trying to fix test equipment is a learning
    experience in itself, and can be quite rewarding even if the conclusion is to
    junk the darn thing for spare parts.

    easier by just using the right selection of components or techniques. “Poop like
    an elephant” refers to sharing your information and discoveries with your fellow
    hackers. No matter how much information you digest, you can never know it all.
    Sharing your findings freely invites the advice and good will of fellow hackers
    and leads to a synergy of minds. Especially in hardware hacking where all results
    have a basis in tangible artifacts, hiding your techniques and results only means
    that other people will eventually re-invent your work without your help. On the
    other hand, do exercise some judgment in what you say or share; people only have
    so much bandwidth and they will listen more closely if you share results that
    are new or interesting in some way.

    Moore’s Law lately, leading to a hardware hacking renaissance. Affordable circuit
    board fabrication services have spring up, and the birth of the Internet has simplified
    the process of acquiring components. In addition, services such as the Mosis chip
    foundry service and FIB (focused ion beam) services have started to bring integrated
    circuit hacking into the realm of financial possibility for individual hardware
    enthusiasts.
