    and not just because it can play the latest video games. The powerful and cheap
    Xbox has the potential to be used as a PC, an all-in-one media player, or even
    a web server. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of books that can teach a reader
    how to explore and modify modern electronic hardware such as the Xbox. Most electronics
    textbooks are theory-oriented and very focused, whereas real hacking requires
    a broad set of practical skills and knowledge. Also, the few practical books on
    hardware hacking that I had as inspiration as a child have long been outdated
    by the fast pace of technology. This book is intended to fill the need for a practical
    guide to understanding and reverse engineering modern computers: a handbook for
    a new generation of hackers.'

  zh: 微软®的XboxTM游戏机是一款令人兴奋的硬件设备，不仅仅因为它可以玩最新的视频游戏。功能强大且价格低廉的Xbox有潜力被用作PC、一体式媒体播放器，甚至网络服务器。不幸的是，关于如何探索和修改现代电子硬件（如Xbox）的书籍寥寥无几。大多数电子教科书都是理论导向且非常专注于理论，而真正的黑客活动需要广泛实用的技能和知识。此外，我小时候作为灵感的那些关于硬件黑客的实用书籍，由于技术发展迅速，早已过时。本书旨在填补理解和逆向工程现代计算机的实用指南的需求：一本面向新一代黑客的手册。
- en: 'The ultimate benefit of hacking the Xbox is its educational value, or as the
    saying goes, “Given a fish, eat for a day; learn to fish, eat for a lifetime.”
    Hence, this book focuses on introducing basic hacking techniques — soldering,
    reverse engineering, debugging — to novice hackers, whileproviding hardware references
    and insight that may be useful to more seasoned hackers. The Xbox has served to
    educate both the security community and the hacking community: not because it
    is an outstanding example of security, but because it is a high profile, high
    volume product made by a large company whose focus was recently defined to be
    security by its chairman.¹ The Xbox experience shows that building trustable clients
    in a hostile user environment is hard, even for a large, well-funded company.
    One observation is that this risk and difficulty of building cheap, trustable
    hardware clients places an upper bound on the importance of the secret that can
    be trusted to such client hardware. In addition, the Xbox provides a consistent
    teaching example, with almost 10 mil ion nearly identical units out there at the
    time of writing. The similarity of the Xbox’s architecture to a vanilla PC adds
    even more educational value to Xbox hacking, since much of the discussion in this
    book also applies directly to the much broader subject of PCs.'

  zh: 黑客Xbox的最终好处是其教育价值，正如俗话所说，“给鱼吃一天；学会钓鱼，吃一辈子。”因此，本书专注于介绍基本的黑客技巧——焊接、逆向工程、调试——给新手黑客，同时提供对硬件的参考和洞察，这些可能对经验更丰富的黑客有所帮助。Xbox已经为安全社区和黑客社区提供了教育价值：不是因为它是安全性的杰出例子，而是因为它是由一家大公司制造的高知名度、高销量产品，其董事长最近将其重点定义为安全性。¹
    Xbox的经验表明，在敌对用户环境中建立可信赖的客户端是困难的，即使是对于一家大型的、资金充足的公司也是如此。一个观察结果是，构建廉价、可信赖的硬件客户端的风险和难度为可以信赖此类客户端硬件的秘密的重要性设定了上限。此外，Xbox提供了一个一致的教学示例，在撰写本书时，有近1000万几乎完全相同的单位。Xbox的架构与普通PC的相似性为Xbox黑客活动增添了更多的教育价值，因为本书中的许多讨论也直接适用于更广泛的PC主题。
- en: Another interesting aspect of Xbox hacking is the underground society of hardware
    hackers following the Xbox. The people who hacked the Xbox and the expertise they
    attained will be relevant long after the Xbox has become a dusty yard sale piece.
    Hence, there is a conscious social focus to this book. I have included profiles
    of a sampling of Xbox hacking personalities. The hope is to inspire people, through
    role models, to pick up a screwdriver and a soldering iron and to start hacking.
    Instilling this sort of exploratory spirit in the younger generations will be
    important in the long run for preserving the pool of talented engineers that drove
    the technology revolution to where it is today. Many of today’s engineers got
    their start hacking and tinkering with ham radios, telephones and computers which,
    back in that day, shipped with a complete set of schematics and source code. This
    pool of engineering talent is essential for maintaining a healthy economy and
    for maintaining strong national security in the computer age.

    the NEC PowerVR2 DC chip, the graphics accelerator used by the Dreamcast, limited
    initial shipments. The following three years were a rollercoaster ride for the
    Dreamcast. Popular games such as Soul Caliber, Dead or Alive 2, Resident Evil,
    Crazy Taxi and Shen Mue buoyed the Dreamcast’s popularity, while Sony’s Playstation2
    launch ate away at the Dreamcast’s sales and ultimately the confidence of software
    developers. Ironically, the quality of the Dreamcast graphics was equivalent or
    superior to quality to early Playstation2 titles, such as Dead or Alive 2, despite
    the extra horsepower packed by the Playstation2\. (The Playstation2 is difficult
    to program, and it took a couple of years for developers to realize its full potential.)

    of 2000\. A German hacker group, Team Utopia, discovered a back door inside the
    Dreamcast’s mask-ROM BIOS that allowed the Dreamcast to boot from a standard CD-ROM.
    Nominally, the Dreamcast uses a proprietary format called the “GD-ROM” for game
    distribution. The GD-ROM format cannot be copied using standard CD or DVD burners.
    However, the back door in the Dreamcast’s ROM BIOS enabled pirates to eventually
    create monolithic CD-ROM images of video games that were bootable without any
    need for hardware modification. Who was going to pay for a game when it could
    be downloaded for free on the internet? The resulting rampant piracy diminished
    game sales, discouraging game developers from developing for the console and damaging
    Sega’s business. Six million units sold, and about three years after its launch,
    the Dreamcast was pulled from the market. Now, Sega is exclusively in the game
    development business, and even makes games for their former competitors Sony and
    Nintendo as well as Microsoft.

    Microsoft’s fate in the console market is intimately linked to the success and

    [from Microsoft] before the circumvention.” ⁶ (Note that authorization is not
    required, but the good faith effort is.) The EFF helped me draft such a letter
    for research. I also had to fight MIT to allow my research to be published as
    an affiliated entity. All of the direct effort of reverse engineering the Xbox
    security was funded out of my own pocket, conducted in my apartment, and done
    after-hours on my own time. MIT initially took advantage of this fact to separate
    themselves from my work, forcing me to seek out the counsel of the EFF. MIT finally
    capitulated and allowed me to publish my paper as a student of MIT after much
    cajoling by sympathetic professors and after I had received a constructive, non-threatening
    letter from Microsoft about my research.

    security mechanisms is incidental copyright circumvention. The information gained
    through the process of reverse engineering can be applied equally to create copyright
    circumvention devices. In other words, the basic research that enables interoperability,
    at least in the case of the Xbox, may also be applied indirectly to those wishing
    to construct circumvention devices. As it turns out, some very specific design
    flaws in the Xbox enable boot security circumvention without necessarily enabling
    copyright circumvention, though these flaws may be patched in the near future,

- en: There are significant economic implications if it turns out that “fair use”
    does not cover the reverse engineering of Xbox security for the purpose of running
    alternate applications. The most significant implication is that Microsoft can
    sell legally restricted hardware to end users, locking users into their software
    base. This can be used to create an unbreakable monopoly over computer hardware
    and software. For example, Microsoft could offer subsidies to vendors that elect
    to secure their hardware to run Microsoft’s operating system. This financial incentive
    will be transferred to customers, who will be motivated to buy the discounted
    hardware. Once a significant portion of the installed base of hardware is locked
    into Microsoft’s operating systems, Microsoft can set prices for their products
    in a competition-free market, since it would be illegal for anyone to run any
    other operating system on locked hardware.

    I wanted to play with it! Curious as I was about the Apple II, I was not allowed

    Sharing your findings freely invites the advice and good will of fellow hackers

    are new or interesting in some way.
