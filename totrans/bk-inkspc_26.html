It does not make much sense to save as <span class="emphasis"><em>Plain SVG</em></span> except when you are trying to achieve a modest file size gain or encounter some buggy software having problems with Inkscape SVG. Both SVG flavors have <span class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span> varieties (using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.svgz</em></span> file name extension), which produce much smaller files but are otherwise the same and should be understood by most SVG software.</p><p>SVG files exported from Adobe Illustrator can be opened in Inkscape as usual. However, these files usually contain a lot of AI-specific stuff, which is useless for Inkscape and just blows up the size of the SVG file. It is recommended to save SVG files from AI with the extension <span class="emphasis"><em>.ai.svg</em></span> instead of simply <span class="emphasis"><em>.svg</em></span>. When you open such a <span class="emphasis"><em>.ai.svg</em></span> file in Inkscape, it goes through a special filter which removes the AI-specific binary chunks and converts AI layers into Inkscape layers.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="B.3 PDF (Import, Export)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="bdot3_pdf_left_parenthesisimportcomma_ex"/>B.3 PDF (Import, Export)</h1></div></div></div><p>After SVG, PDF is the most powerful, best supported by Inkscape, and most widely recognized vector format (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html#onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector" title="1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats">1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats</a></strong></span>). While Inkscape cannot yet be recommended for roundtrip PDF editing (i.e., opening a PDF, editing its content, and saving back as PDF) due to the font support limitations (see the following section), PDF is definitely the best option for connecting Inkscape with software which does not support SVG.</p><p>Inkscape’s <span class="emphasis"><em>PDF import</em></span> is built-in (requires no external software to install) and supports most of static features of latest versions of PDF (shapes, text, images, gradients, opacity, etc.). Interactive PDF features (such as forms) are not supported. Since Inkscape cannot have multiple pages in one document, you will need to specify which single page from a PDF file to import. This choice is the main purpose of the <span class="strong"><strong>PDF Import Settings</strong></span> dialog you see when you try to import or open a PDF file (<a class="xref" href="apbs03.html#pdf_import_options" title="Figure B-2. PDF import options">Figure B-2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="pdf_import_options"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00434"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736534.png.jpg" alt="PDF import options"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure B-2. PDF import options</p></div><p><a id="iddle2248" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2252" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4434" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4965" class="indexterm"/>In the dialog, you can browse the PDF document’s pages and choose the one you need, based on the preview image (right pane) that shows the page selected in the counter at top left.</p><p>Also, you can optionally clip the imported artwork to the various boxes which may be defined in PDF; for example, clipping to the media box (i.e., page size) hides any objects that the PDF might contain outside the page area (most PDF viewers won’t show them anyway, but Inkscape allows you to discover them).</p><div class="sect2" title="B.3.1 PDF Text"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bdot3dot1_pdf_text"/>B.3.1 PDF Text</h2></div></div></div><p>The biggest limitation of the current PDF import support is its treatment of fonts. Most PDF files have their fonts embedded, and Inkscape cannot use these embedded fonts, nor can it convert text to paths on import (the <span class="strong"><strong>Text handling</strong></span> choice in the <span class="strong"><strong>PDF Import Settings</strong></span> dialog has only one option, <span class="strong"><strong>Import text as text</strong></span>). In practice, this means that any text in the imported PDF file will look right if and only if the font it uses is installed on your system; otherwise, a default font will be used which will not only look different but, in most cases, will badly butcher spacing and alignment in text columns.</p><p>An additional complication is that most PDFs refer to the font they use by their <span class="emphasis"><em>PostScript names</em></span>, which are slightly different from the names of fonts your operating system shows. For example, PDF may refer to a font called <code class="literal">AlbertusMT-Light</code> whereas the same font in your Inkscape list is called <code class="literal">Albertus MT Lt</code>. Inkscape tries its best to convert the PostScript names to regular names, but it can only do this for fonts which you have installed, and even then it sometimes fails and chooses a wrong installed font.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="app02note02"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Whether or not this font name conversion was successful, you can always look up the original PostScript name of the font of any text object in imported PDF by looking at its</em></span> <code class="literal">style</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>attribute in XML Editor (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s07.html" title="4.7 The XML Editor">4.7 The XML Editor</a></strong></span>).

After you type the filename and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, you will be presented with a dialog for setting PDF export options:</p><div class="figure"><a id="pdf_export_options"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00435"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736536.png.jpg" alt="PDF export options"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure B-3. PDF export options</p></div><p>The version of PDF you can export is limited to 1.4. As for fonts, Inkscape’s own export is smarter than its import: Any fonts used in your SVG document will be embedded as subsets (i.e., only the characters actually used in the document) into the PDF it produces. Also, you have the option of converting all text objects to paths on export, in which case even Inkscape itself will be able to import the PDF back, preserving the appearance of text objects.</p><p>Filters (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Filters">Chapter 17</a>) are a feature of SVG which has no counterpart in PDF. Therefore, you have the option of converting any filtered objects to bitmaps on export (<span class="strong"><strong>Rasterize filter effects</strong></span>). If you uncheck this, filters will be simply ignored (e.g., any blurred object will be crisp). Rasterization has the disadvantage of inflating the file size and losing the vector editability of the objects affected, but it preserves the filtered appearance of the objects. The <span class="strong"><strong>resolution</strong></span> parameter applies to these automatically generated filter bitmaps; set it to 90 dpi for PDFs that are intended for viewing on screen, and to at least 300 dpi for PDFs that are intended for print.</p><p>The rest of the options specify which objects and what area of the document to export into PDF. By default, the page size of the PDF is the same as that of your SVG, and any objects outside the page are therefore hidden (but still present in the PDF code). If you enable <span class="strong"><strong>Export drawing, not page</strong></span>, the PDF page will be as big as the bounding box of the entire drawing, regardless of its page size. The <span class="strong"><strong>Limit export</strong></span> option ensures that only the objects whose IDs (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s01.html" title="4.1 Object Properties">4.1 Object Properties</a></strong></span>) you list here will be exported, while all others are ignored. For example, in a file with several logos you can export each logo to its own PDF file using this option; make sure to also enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Export drawing, not page</strong></span>, which in this case interprets “drawing” as “those objects that will be exported.”</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="app02note03"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For importing PDF, Inkscape uses the Poppler library</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://poppler.freedesktop.org">http://poppler.freedesktop.org</a>). <span class="emphasis"><em>For exporting PDF, as well as PS and EPS formats, it uses the Cairo library</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://cairographics.org">http://cairographics.org</a>). <span class="emphasis"><em>These libraries are being actively developed, and future versions of Inkscape will likely improve the PDF support simply by including newer versions of these libraries.</em></span></p></div></div></div>

Now, however, it has largely ceded its position to PDF, which supports all practically useful features of PostScript but is at the same time richer (most importantly, it supports transparency) and much easier to support in software. So, whenever you have the choice, use PDF instead of PostScript; however, a lot of old projects and clipart exist as PostScript files, and there’s still a lot of obsolete software around which either does not support PDF at all or supports it poorly while trying its best to understand PostScript.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="app02note04"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>EPS is PostScript with some additional limitations which make it better adapted to being imported and inserted into other documents.

The dialog has much the same options as the PDF export dialog:</p><div class="figure"><a id="ps_or_eps_export_options"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00436"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736538.png.jpg" alt="PS or EPS export options"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure B-4. PS or EPS export options</p></div><p>You can choose the level (i.e., version) of PostScript; most modern software and printers support Level 3. Fonts are always embedded into PS or EPS export (unless you choose to convert them to paths), and filters can be optionally rasterized, just as they are in PDF export. Objects with nonzero opacity are also rasterized automatically (you cannot suppress it) because, unlike PDF, PostScript does not support vector transparency.</p><p>For PS and EPS import, you have to install an additional piece of software, the Ghostscript interpreter, which is run automatically to convert the PS or EPS file into PDF format, which is then fed to Inkscape. At <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost</a></em></span>, you will find its versions for all major operating systems. Make sure the <span class="emphasis"><em>gs</em></span> or (on Windows) <span class="emphasis"><em>gs.exe</em></span> executable file of Ghostscript is in your <code class="literal">PATH</code>; if it is not the case, Inkscape will not even list PS and EPS in its file format list in the <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> dialogs.</p><p>Since PS/EPS import ends up as PDF import from the Inkscape viewpoint, you will see the same PDF import dialog (<a class="xref" href="apbs03.html#pdf_import_options" title="Figure B-2. PDF import options">Figure B-2</a>). In particular, if a PS file contains more than one page, this dialog will allow you to choose which page to import.</p></div>

If you select the <span class="strong"><strong>Print to file</strong></span> option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Print</strong></span> dialog, you will get a PS or PDF file that looks exactly the same as if you saved your file with this file type.</p><p>Most of the options in your <span class="strong"><strong>Print</strong></span> dialog (such as paper size, margins, print quality, and so on) will depend on your operating system and the printer driver. The only thing that Inkscape adds to this dialog is the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> tab.</p><p>By default, Inkscape prints by exporting the document to a vector format (PostScript or PDF). As explained earlier, Inkscape is smart enough to rasterize those objects using the features these formats don’t support: filters (both PS and PDF) and transparency (PS only). However, if for some reason you don’t like this selective rasterization, you can render the entire document into bitmap by switching from <span class="strong"><strong>Vector</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Bitmap</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> tab and setting the bitmap resolution. This option is generally safer, as it avoids any kinds of surprises that format conversion may hold, but it may result in very large print files and slow printing.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="B.6 AI (Import)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="bdot6_ai_left_parenthesisimportright_par"/>B.6 AI (Import)</h1></div></div></div><p>Up to version 8, Adobe Illustrator’s native format was based on PostScript (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html#onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector" title="1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats">1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats</a></strong></span>). It was not fully standard PostScript, however, and importing it into other software has always been a pain. There now exist various scripts on the Web which claim to convert this old AI format into something more tractable, but they are all rather limited and not too reliable. While you can try to use them, officially Inkscape 0.47 does not support import or export of the old AI format.</p><p>Starting from version 9, Adobe switched to PDF for the base of its new Illustrator format. The AI files saved by Illustrator still contain many AI-specific extensions; however, they are standard PDF and any PDF-capable software can open and view them as PDF. This is what Inkscape does: It treats any file with the <span class="emphasis"><em>.ai</em></span> extension as a PDF file and presents its standard <span class="strong"><strong>PDF Import Settings</strong></span> dialog to you (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="apbs03.html" title="B.3 PDF (Import, Export)">B.3 PDF (Import, Export)</a></strong></span>). Inkscape will thus lose the AI-specific metadata (such as layers), but at least you will get your vector objects as vectors.</p><p>One feature used in complex AI files is <span class="emphasis"><em>gradient meshes</em></span> (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html#onedot5dot4_dot_dot_dot_and_inkscape" title="1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape">1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape</a></strong></span>). Inkscape can import them, but since there’s no similar construct in SVG, it has to approximate them with a lattice of small flat-color path “tiles.” In the <span class="strong"><strong>PDF Import Settings</strong></span> dialog, you can set the precision of this approximation; raising this parameter will make the imported mesh look smoother, but at the cost of increasing the size of the SVG file and slowing down Inkscape.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="app02note05"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Imported gradient meshes, with their lattices of small colored paths, are a convenient object for moving, painting, and reshaping in the Tweak tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch06s09.html" title="6.9 Transforming with the Tweak Tool">6.9 Transforming with the Tweak Tool</a></strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html" title="8.7 Color Tweaking">8.7 Color Tweaking</a></strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s06.html" title="12.6 Path Tweaking">12.6 Path Tweaking</a></strong></span>).</em></span></p></div><p>There’s no support for AI export in Inkscape, because all recent versions of Adobe Illustrator can import SVG and PDF files without problems.</p></div>

Inkscape’s native support for ODG export is limited, but still useful for exchanging data with OpenOffice—as of this writing, OpenOffice still lacks proper support for SVG.</p></div>

However, Inkscape can export the paths and shapes in its drawing as a 3D scene which POVRay will then render; you can manually edit the text-based <span class="emphasis"><em>.pov</em></span> file to adjust angles, cameras, lighting, etc.</p></div>

For data exchange with Adobe Flash or Adobe Freehand, you can use SVG or PDF formats, but direct support of these important formats would be preferable. Fortunately, it is very easy to plug in a new format into Inkscape; as soon as there’s an open source utility which can bridge from one of the known formats (ideally SVG, but PDF would work too) into the unknown, incorporating it into Inkscape is easy.</p></div></body></html>
