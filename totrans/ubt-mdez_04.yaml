    and writing email messages than doing just about anything else. Even if you’re
    not much of a surfer, numerous applications that aren’t really Internet applications
    per se still use the Internet in someway, such as by gathering song and album
    information when you rip audio CDs to create MP3 files. Having a computer that
    isn’t hooked up to the Internet is like buying a new Maserati and then refusing

    There are a number of possibilities, including high-speed local area networks
    (LANs), cable modems, mobile (3G/4G) broadband, and ADSL connections from phone
    companies. Some computers still have an internal 56 Kbps modem or can be connected
    to external dial-up modems for slower connections over regular phone lines. Depending
    on what you have, setting things up on your system should prove a cinch in the
    case of LAN connections and any other types of connections that use your Ethernet
    port (such as cable modems), possibly a tad more work in the case of wireless
    and mobile connections, and sometimes a bit of a challenge when it comes to dial-up
    connections. In this chapter, you will learn how to set up these connections,
    and in the next chapter, you will learn a bit about what Linux has to offer in
    terms of the most commonly used Internet applications.

    are built in to almost all modern laptops, while for older models they are usually
    add-ons in the form of cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot on the side of your

    some cards can be tricky to deal with. You’ll find some tips on how to deal with
    awkward cards in [Chapter 22](ch22.html "Chapter 22. Wounded Wings"), but if you’re

    better, but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the card you
    are using is Linux compatible. No matter what wireless card you are wondering
    about, the easiest way to find out whether it will work is just to try it. The
    Linux kernel now comes with many wireless drivers built in, and Ubuntu updates
    often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those
    drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things don’t seem to work, check Ubuntu’s
    list of supported cards ([https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/))
    or check the Ubuntu forums to find a driver that is compatible or to see whether
    anyone has experience with your particular card. If you want to set up a wireless
    system in your home or office, then you will also need to get a *wireless access
    point* (WAP), shown on the left of [Figure 4-4](ch04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wi-fi_setupman_access
    "Figure 4-4. All you need for a Wi-Fi setup—an access point and a network interface
    card"). Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not much of an issue in this department,

    settings are handled via your web browser.

    a seemingly random string of numbers and letters that is 10, 26, or even 58 characters
    long and looks something like this: `af564ecb31ce4a678b23fe5981`. Try typing your
    own wireless key (not the one that I just used as an example!) instead of the

    may still be using a dial-up Internet connection, which means you need to have
    a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your box to the outside world. In
    case you broadband surf-gods have forgotten, modems are those wonderful machines
    that whistle, chime, screech, and spit whenever you dial up your Internet provider.
    I suppose you could think of them as noisy telephones in need of a good burp.

- en: Now here comes the bad news—in the world of Linux, very few internal modems
    are supported, and for those that are, the setup process can be frustrating. The
    main reason behind this compatibility problem is that most built-in modems are
    software dependent and the software they depend on is part of, or designed for,
    Windows. Such modems are thus called *Winmodems*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with these Winmodem
    beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. Though support for the wide
    variety of Winmodem models out there is still spotty, things are better than before,
    so you might luck out. My advice is to hold off on the wondering and worrying
    and just give your modem a try to see whether it works. If it does, then you’re
    all set. If it doesn’t, well, you do have some options, and at least you haven’t
    done any damage to your system.

    up your dial-up connection. First, get the settings information you need from
    your Internet provider. Most providers aim their operations at Windows and, often,
    Mac users, and very few offer Linux support. Still, there is no technical reason
    for your Linux system not to work via their setups, so just nag and push them
    until they give you the information you want. After that, make sure your modem
    is connected to a live telephone connection—for example, the phone jack in your
    wall.

    all of the setting up here, but there’s a caveat: It’s not installed by default,
    and you need an Internet connection to install it! If you have access to some
    other Internet connection that you can use temporarily, connect to that and use
    the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install GNOME PPP (see [Chapter 6](ch06.html
    "Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird") to learn how to install software). The alternative
    is to use the pppconfig command, which is installed by default but is difficult

    best-case scenario. What happens, however, if your modem and Ubuntu do not see
    eye to eye? Well, there are a few options. My first, more radical suggestion is
    to dump your dial-up ISP and find a broadband provider that covers your local
    area. If that is not an option, then you have two ways to go. One is to try to
    geek around with your modem to see whether you can get it to work. This is a slightly
    complicated process, but there are instructions at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/).
    If you are faint of heart or a novice user, you may find the process to entail
    a bit more than what you’re willing to deal with.

    a true hardware modem. *Hardware modems* are not software dependent, so they work
    with any operating system. You can think of them as telephones without a handset.
  prefs: []

    the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal slot) and 56 PC
    Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true hardware modems that are easily
    available and are said to work. You can check out the USRobotics site ([http://www.usr.com/](http://www.usr.com/))
    for more information on these models, though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions
    is always a good idea as well. Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an
    external dial-up modem. They come with either serial or USB connectors and sit
    in a box outside your computer. They bring the advantage of not requiring you
    to open up the computer to install them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linux support for USB modems can be patchy, so do your research before buying
    one. Serial modems are a safer bet since most of them should work with your system
    . . . if you have a serial port, that is. Modern computers rarely have them anymore,
    so check to see whether you have one by looking at the back of your computer for
    a connector with little prongs in it (see [Figure 4-7](ch04.html#serial_port_and_connector
    "Figure 4-7. Serial port and connector")). If you are worried and are looking
    for a sure thing, USRobotics makes an external serial modem that is compatible
    with Linux, and the company says so right on its website.

    to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search on that modem’s
    make and model number, along with the word *linux*, and see what results you get.
    Of course, you can also try one of the Linux forums and ask about the modem make
    and model there. A lot of people are in the same boat, so you are sure to get
    plenty of opinions and advice.
