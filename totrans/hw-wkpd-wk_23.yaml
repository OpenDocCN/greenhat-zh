    is readily available, easy to use, and covers an immense amount of information
    about subjects that students at all levels study.

    this, some teachers have incorporated editing and analyzing Wikipedia articles
    into their syllabi. On the other hand, many teachers and schools have profound
    concerns about using Wikipedia. In this section, we''ll talk about using Wikipedia
    in two educational contexts: as a reference resource used by students, both in
    and out of the classroom, and as a possible source of teaching material for classroom
    editing projects.'

    on CD or DVD, as summarized in [Appendix A](hw-wkpd-wk_22.html "Appendix A. Reusing
    Wikimedia Content"). Two of these selections were designed specifically for schools,
    one particularly geared toward the UK National Curriculum. You can browse the
    articles on the DVD, which were edited and checked for suitability, at [http://schools-wikipedia.org/](http://schools-wikipedia.org/).

    also be appropriate. Available at [http://simple.wikipedia.org/](http://simple.wikipedia.org/),
    this site aims to cover the same topics as the English-language Wikipedia, but
    in a simpler version of English. The breadth of the site is not nearly as large
    as that of the English-language Wikipedia, however, and many articles are still
    stubs.

    made news.^([[37](#ftn.CHP-B-FNOTE-1)]) The question is, of course, whether banning
    Wikipedia as a source will actually prevent students from using the site—or simply
    encourage students to avoid citing it. Our feeling is that students will use Wikipedia
    regardless; simply requiring students to go beyond Wikipedia (as with any encyclopedia)
    in their assignments may be a better solution. Students should cite additional
    sources for their projects, and often good Wikipedia articles can point students
    to some of those additional sources, though teachers should make sure these aren't
    the only references students use. Make your expectations regarding using Wikipedia
    for assignments clear. Discussing Wikipedia and its policies in detail can also
    be a good introduction to thinking critically about bias and authorship of any
    information source, online or off. Just figuring out what a neutral point of view
    might be for a controversial topic is a lesson in itself! Teaching students to
    assess each article separately, using the criteria mentioned in [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html
    "Chapter 4. Understanding and Evaluating an Article"), is also important; Wikipedia
    is not a monolithic source and it should be clear that it is not of uniformly
    good or poor quality.

    Citations to Wikipedia should always include the (accurate) name of the article
    and a link to the particular version of the article that was accessed. You can
    get this by clicking either the Permanent link or the Cite This Page link on the
    left-hand sidebar when you are viewing an article. Cite This Page, in particular,
    provides an easy way to get citations for the article formatted using a number
    of academic styles. For instance, an American Psychological Association–style,

- en: Several projects have been developed that incorporate editing Wikipedia articles
    into classroom activities. Some teachers (primarily at the university level) have
    even made contributing good Wikipedia articles a requirement in place of term
    papers. A list of current and ongoing projects can be found at [[Wikipedia:School
    and university projects]], which also collects other resources for those trying
    to start a classroom project. [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Classroom coordination]]
    (shortcut WP:WPCC) also has a list of Wikipedia volunteers who are willing to
    help teachers work with Wikipedia at any level. If you start a classroom project,
    listing it on these pages and making other active editors aware of the articles
    your students are working on can be helpful; other editors are usually glad to
    help answer questions and help students navigate Wikipedia.

- en: In general, assignments for student writing on Wikipedia should take into account
    the realities of the core policies and the fact that unwanted contributions will
    be quickly removed or changed. Make sure that students are familiar with Wikipedia
    and content policies and have time to experiment with editing and learn basic
    syntax. Having the students create logins (and having them edit while logged in)
    is also recommended, as this gives you a way to keep track of their contributions
    if they share their usernames with you. Keeping track of your students' contributions
    also helps you make sure things are going smoothly. Students can work individually
    or as a team, but it's important to reinforce that Wikipedia is generally a collaborative
    project. They will be working with other editors who are outside the school environment
    and who will not give them any special consideration for being students.

    take than asking students to create brand-new articles. As noted in [Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html
    "Chapter 5. Basic Editing"), finding a new article topic that meets notability
    standards can be difficult; much of the "low-hanging fruit" is already taken.
    Wikipedia has hundreds of thousands of existing articles that could use a thorough
    reworking, however. (If you''re working with advanced-level students in a topic
    area that needs to be expanded, requiring that students start new articles may
    be a good idea.) Be creative: If the class is focusing on a particular subject
    area, have students research new information to add to articles that need expanding
    or fact-check poorly cited articles. If you are teaching composition or editing,
    you might have students copyedit or rewrite poor-quality articles for practice.
    If you''re teaching upper-level students, you might have them rate articles in
    their topic area or have students work on the article version in the Simple English
    Wikipedia as a way to practice explaining information clearly using simpler language.
    For students at any level, working on adding reliable references and sources to
    articles provides an ideal opportunity to learn research skills.'

    for another project, such as a term paper, directly to Wikipedia. Often such work
    is cast in a tone and style that is inappropriate for a general encyclopedia (see
    [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research")). If you
    require students to edit Wikipedia articles, make this a separate writing project
    from other work.
