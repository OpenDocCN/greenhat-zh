    and out of the classroom, and as a possible source of teaching material for classroom

    on CD or DVD, as summarized in [Appendix A](hw-wkpd-wk_22.html "Appendix A. Reusing
    Wikimedia Content"). Two of these selections were designed specifically for schools,
    one particularly geared toward the UK National Curriculum. You can browse the

    this site aims to cover the same topics as the English-language Wikipedia, but

  zh: 引导学生使用维基百科
- en: Some school districts have banned the use of Wikipedia, an action which has
    made news.^([[37](#ftn.CHP-B-FNOTE-1)]) The question is, of course, whether banning
    Wikipedia as a source will actually prevent students from using the site—or simply
    encourage students to avoid citing it. Our feeling is that students will use Wikipedia
    regardless; simply requiring students to go beyond Wikipedia (as with any encyclopedia)
    in their assignments may be a better solution. Students should cite additional
    sources for their projects, and often good Wikipedia articles can point students
    to some of those additional sources, though teachers should make sure these aren't
    the only references students use. Make your expectations regarding using Wikipedia
    for assignments clear. Discussing Wikipedia and its policies in detail can also
    be a good introduction to thinking critically about bias and authorship of any
    information source, online or off. Just figuring out what a neutral point of view
    might be for a controversial topic is a lesson in itself! Teaching students to
    assess each article separately, using the criteria mentioned in [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html
    "Chapter 4. Understanding and Evaluating an Article"), is also important; Wikipedia
    is not a monolithic source and it should be clear that it is not of uniformly
    good or poor quality.

    Citations to Wikipedia should always include the (accurate) name of the article
    and a link to the particular version of the article that was accessed. You can
    get this by clicking either the Permanent link or the Cite This Page link on the
    left-hand sidebar when you are viewing an article. Cite This Page, in particular,
    provides an easy way to get citations for the article formatted using a number
    of academic styles. For instance, an American Psychological Association–style,

- en: In general, assignments for student writing on Wikipedia should take into account
    the realities of the core policies and the fact that unwanted contributions will
    be quickly removed or changed. Make sure that students are familiar with Wikipedia
    and content policies and have time to experiment with editing and learn basic
    syntax. Having the students create logins (and having them edit while logged in)
    is also recommended, as this gives you a way to keep track of their contributions
    if they share their usernames with you. Keeping track of your students' contributions
    also helps you make sure things are going smoothly. Students can work individually
    or as a team, but it's important to reinforce that Wikipedia is generally a collaborative
    project. They will be working with other editors who are outside the school environment
    and who will not give them any special consideration for being students.

  zh: 通常情况下，学生在维基百科上写作的作业应考虑到核心政策的现实情况以及不希望的贡献将被迅速删除或更改的事实。确保学生熟悉维基百科和内容政策，并有时间尝试编辑和学习基本语法。建议让学生创建登录名（并在登录状态下进行编辑），因为这样你可以跟踪他们的贡献，如果他们与你分享用户名的话。跟踪学生的贡献也有助于你确保一切进展顺利。学生可以单独工作或作为团队，但重要的是要强调维基百科通常是一个协作项目。他们将与其他编辑者合作，这些编辑者处于学校环境之外，并且不会因为他们是学生而给予他们任何特殊考虑。
- en: 'Assigning an article for cleanup or expansion is probably a better route to
    take than asking students to create brand-new articles. As noted in [Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html
    "Chapter 5. Basic Editing"), finding a new article topic that meets notability
    standards can be difficult; much of the "low-hanging fruit" is already taken.
    Wikipedia has hundreds of thousands of existing articles that could use a thorough
    reworking, however. (If you''re working with advanced-level students in a topic
    area that needs to be expanded, requiring that students start new articles may
    be a good idea.) Be creative: If the class is focusing on a particular subject
    area, have students research new information to add to articles that need expanding
    or fact-check poorly cited articles. If you are teaching composition or editing,
    you might have students copyedit or rewrite poor-quality articles for practice.
    If you''re teaching upper-level students, you might have them rate articles in
    their topic area or have students work on the article version in the Simple English
    Wikipedia as a way to practice explaining information clearly using simpler language.
    For students at any level, working on adding reliable references and sources to
    articles provides an ideal opportunity to learn research skills.'

    for another project, such as a term paper, directly to Wikipedia. Often such work
    is cast in a tone and style that is inappropriate for a general encyclopedia (see
    [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research")). If you
    require students to edit Wikipedia articles, make this a separate writing project
    from other work.
