- en: 'The goal of this book is to share the art of hacking with everyone. Understanding
    hacking techniques is often difficult, since it requires both breadth and depth
    of knowledge. Many hacking texts seem esoteric and confusing because of just a
    few gaps in this prerequisite education. This second edition of *Hacking: The
    Art of Exploitation* makes the world of hacking more accessible by providing the
    complete picture—from programming to machine code to exploitation. In addition,
    this edition features a bootable LiveCD based on Ubuntu Linux that can be used
    in any computer with an *x*86 processor, without modifying the computer''s existing
    OS. This CD contains all the source code in the book and provides a development
    and exploitation environment you can use to follow along with the book''s examples
    and experiment along the way.'
