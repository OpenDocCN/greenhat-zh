This concludes <span class="emphasis"><em>The Tangled Web</em></span>! I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this book as much as I’ve enjoyed exploring the world of browser security over the last decade or so. I also hope that what you’ve discovered on these pages will guide you in your future journeys, wherever they may be.</p><p>As for what to make of it all: To me, the stark contrast between the amazing robustness of the modern Web and the inexplicable unsoundness of its foundations was difficult to reconcile at first. In retrospect, I think it offers an important insight into our own, unreasonable attitude about securing the online world.</p><p>I am haunted by the uncomfortable observation that in real life, modern societies are built on remarkably shaky ground. Every day, each of us depends on the sanity, moral standards, and restraint of thousands of random strangers—from cab drivers, to food vendors, to elevator repair techs. The rules of the game are weakly enforced through a series of deterrence mechanisms, but if crime statistics are to be believed, their efficacy is remarkably low. The problem isn’t just that most petty criminals think they can get away with their misdeeds but that they are usually right.</p><p>In this sense, our world is little more than an incredibly elaborate honor system that most of us voluntarily agree to participate in. And that’s probably okay: Compliance with self-imposed norms has proven to be a smart evolutionary move, and it is a part of who we are today. A degree of trust is simply essential to advancing our civilization at a reasonable pace. Too, paradoxically, despite short-term weaknesses, accelerated progress makes us all a lot stronger and more adaptable in the long run.</p><p>It is difficult to understand, then, why we treat our online existence in such a dramatically different way. For example, why is it that we get upset at developers who use cryptography incorrectly, but we don’t mind that the locks on our doors can be opened with a safety pin? Why do we scorn web developers who can’t get input validation right, but we don’t test our breakfast for laxatives or LSD?</p><p>The only explanation I can see is that humankind has had thousands of years to work out the rules of social engagement in the physical realm. During that time, entire societies have collapsed, new ones have emerged, and an increasingly complex system of behavioral norms, optimized for the preservation of communities, has emerged in the process. Unfortunately for us, we have difficulty transposing these rules into the online ecosystem, and this world is so young, it hasn’t had the chance to develop its own, separate code of conduct yet.</p><p>The phenomenon is easy to see: While your neighbor will not try to sneak into your house, he may have no qualms about using your wireless network because doing so feels much less like a crime. He may oppose theft, but he may be ambivalent about unlawfully duplicating digital content. Or he may frown upon crude graffiti in the neighborhood but chuckle at the sight of a defaced website. The parallels are there but just aren’t good enough.</p><p>What if our pursuit of perfection in the world of information security stems from nothing but a fundamental misunderstanding of how human communities can emerge and flourish? The experts of my kind preach a model of networked existence based on complete distrust, but perhaps wrongly so: As the complexity of our online interactions approaches that of real life, the odds of designing perfectly secure software are rapidly diminishing. Meanwhile, the extreme paranoia begins to take a heavy toll on how quickly we can progress.</p><p>Perhaps we are peddling a recipe for a failure. What if our insistence on absolute security only takes us closer to the fate of so many other early civilizations, which collapsed under the weight of their flaws and ultimately vanished? I find this perverse thought difficult to dismiss. Fortunately, we know that from the rubble, new, more enlightened societies will certainly emerge one day. Their ultimate nature is anyone’s guess.</p></div></body></html>
