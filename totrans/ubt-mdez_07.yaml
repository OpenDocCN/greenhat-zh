    Some people are very organized, placing every file in a logically named folder
    as soon as that file is saved for the first time. Then there are people like me,
    who save everything to the desktop until it is so full of junk that they can no
    longer make out the wallpaper, and only at that point do they start organizing
    in earnest (if placing all of those files in a single folder called *March17Cleanup*
    can be called organizing).

    band is, unsurprisingly, a short list of the files you’ve been working with recently.

    search in the Dash isn’t case sensitive (you can use uppercase and lowercase letters,
    and it doesn’t care), but it does care about spelling. If the search term you
    use doesn’t appear somewhere in the name of the file, exactly as you typed it,
    then it won’t show up in the search results. Also, be aware that the search doesn’t
    look inside the files—only at the name of the file. Say, for example, that you
    wrote a word-processed document with the title “Clouds Are Fluffy” and saved it
    with the filename *clouds.doc*. Searching for *clouds* would find the file, but
    searching for *fluffy* would not. Where you saved the file also matters: In general,
    most of the places where you might save files are fine (they should be in your
    *Home folder*, which you’ll learn more about shortly), but if you put it on a

    recipe a couple of months ago, seasoned to perfection following a particularly
    successful session of experimentation with your herb collection. But where’d that
    pesky recipe go? You open the Dash, type **`recipe`**, and, unsurprisingly for
    a culinary whiz such as yourself, 112 results appear. A quick scan of the first
    few files reveals pictures of your marvelous creations, a few word-processed documents
    containing recipes, and a song or two off the Ray Charles album *Ingredients in
    a Recipe for Soul*. Hmm, not so helpful. So what do you do?

    using a word processor (more on that in [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Penguins
    at Work")), so you know that the recipe must be in a regular document—it’s not
    an audio or video file, at least. The thing to do here is to select Documents
    from under the Type filter. The search is narrowed, and the photos and songs vanish
    from the results. There are still 40 results left, though. Since you only came
    up with the recipe a couple of months back, you click **Last year** under the
    Last modified filter (meaning that files modified in the last year will be shown).
    *Et voilá*, there’s the lasagna recipe, peeking out at you from a rather more
    manageable list of only 12 search results. *Bon appetit!*

    however, the Music search is capable of matching more than just a song’s filename—it
    also looks as the song title, artist name, and album title. What’s more, the search

    and then deselecting **Sidebar**. The checkmark next to that entry will disappear,
    as will the sidebar. (Alternatively, press the F9 key on the keyboard to do the
    same.) To get the sidebar back, just return to the **View** ▸ **Sidebar** menu

    itself.

    either side of the line). When it’s hovering exactly over the line, the mouse
    pointer will change from its usual appearance, a single arrow, to a horizontal
    pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions. This tells you that the border
    of the sidebar, the thin gray line, can be dragged in order to resize the sidebar.
    Getting the pointer directly over the line can be a little frustrating, in that
    it might take a few goes to get the double arrow to appear, but once it does,
    click and drag to resize the sidebar.

    Keystroke-wise, that would be ctrl-C to copy and, as before, ctrl-V to paste.

    though this involves more hands than required for a drag-and-drop move; fortunately,
    the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold the ctrl key while you drag
    the file or folder you want to copy to the target location. Be sure to release
    the mouse button first and then the ctrl key (releasing in the opposite order
    will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its new location and the

    you should pretty much be able to figure out how to get from here to there in
    your Home folder. Still, it’s probably a good idea to know where your Home folder
    actually is in the scheme of things, just in case you manage to get yourself really
    lost someday. To understand this, you should have a basic understanding of the
    Linux filesystem, which, as you will find, is a bit different from what you were
    accustomed to in your previous operating system.
  prefs: []

- en: Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem all stems from a single point called *root*
    and is represented by a solitary forward slash (/). Your own user account folder
    is located within a subfolder of root called *home*. This is represented as */home*
    or, to put it into words, the Home folder within root. If your user account were
    to have the same name as mine, *rg*, the path to that folder would be */home/rg*,
    or the *rg* folder within *home* within root. Whatever the name of your user account
    or the names of any other accounts you have on your machine happen to be, just
    remember that when you are lost, your folder and those of all the other folks
    with user accounts on your machine are located within the Home folder. If you’re
    a more graphically oriented person, the map in [Figure 7-6](ch07.html#the_location_of_your_usersa_folders_with

    and user account folders. Several other directories appear at the same level as
    Home, though for the most part, you shouldn’t be mucking around with them unless
    you know what you’re doing. Fortunately, most of these folders are write protected,
    so you should be fairly well protected from yourself. Still, it is natural to
    be curious about what those other folders are there for, since . . . well, they’re
    there. So, to satisfy your curiosity a bit, I’ll do a little explaining.
  prefs: []

    essential elements of your system are located in */sbin*. Other elements that
    need to be there such as commands and the like, though they may not be used, are
    located in */bin*. Most of the applications that you actually think of as applications
    and use in a hands-on way are located in */usr*. Finally, some add-on applications,
    such as RealPlayer, install themselves into */opt*.

    and */media*. The first of these, */etc*, is the location of all the configuration
    files on your system. The second, */lib*, is the home of all of the libraries
    that are required by your system or applications installed on it. These libraries
    are the Linux equivalent of a Windows *.dll* file. Finally, */media* is where
    the contents of your various attached external media (such as USB drives and CDs)
    appear when present.
  prefs: []

    for the average Linux newbie and, to be honest, probably not all that interesting
    to you at this stage. Anyway, as I mentioned, there is no reason for you to be
    mucking around with any of these folders for the time being, because you can access
    the items located within them in different, and much safer, ways.

    a computer, such as a folder, where other users on a network can access and save
    files. The *Shared Documents* folder on a Windows system is a good example. Other
    users on a network can copy files from and (usually) write files to the *Shared

    You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the machine, as long

    states are referred to as *permissions*.

    I will give you some examples of how it can be useful. Let’s say you have some
    files that you don’t want your spouse or kids to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas
    shopping list, for example. By denying read permission to those files or to a
    folder containing those files, you keep anyone else from sneaking a peek unless
    that person is savvy at changing permissions and has the permissions necessary
    to change permissions for those files or folders.

    on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might accidentally
    ruin that file in some way, you could deny yourself write permission. By doing
    this, you wouldn’t be able to save any changes you make to that file. You would
    be given the Save As option so that you could save a new copy of the file, but

    own. While you’re probably not going around creating your own Linux distros, you
    might come up with a set of files that you need to repeatedly burn to disc now
    or in the future, for example. To create your own ISO, follow the normal process
    for creating a data CD, but when the CD/DVD Creator window ([Figure 7-12](ch07.html#setting_options_before_burning_a_cd_or_d
    "Figure 7-12. Setting options before burning a CD or DVD")) appears, select **Image
    File** from the drop-down menu and then click **Properties**. This will open a
    new window asking for a filename for your new disc image. Give it a name, click
    **Close**, and hit the **Create Image** button. In a very short time, you will
    have an ISO of your own creation.

    CDs. These are CDs on which data is added one session at a time. For example,
    you burn a few files to disc today and add a few more to the disc tomorrow and
    a few more files the day after that. Each time you burn additional files to the
    same disc, you are adding a session, which explains the name *multisession*. You
    can basically think of the CDs as working like floppy disks (albeit with a lot
    more storage capacity).

- en: Now you’ve created and extracted a compressed archive, which is in this case
    a Zip file. You can also create a compressed tarball in the future by following
    the same procedure (probably with real rather than dummy files), but when it’s
    time to select an archive type, select *.tar.gz* instead of *.zip*. Other than
    that single step, it is the same creation and extraction process.
