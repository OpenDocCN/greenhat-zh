Of all Inkscape operations, selecting has, by far, the greatest number of methods, tools, dialogs, and shortcuts available. You need to know a good portion of them to be able to work efficiently, and at least a few of them to be able to work in Inkscape at all.</p><p>By itself, selecting or deselecting objects does not change the document in any way. Therefore, none of the techniques described in this chapter are undoable actions and none require the document to be saved.</p></div>

Selection is local to the editing window; if you open a second window with the same document (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s05.html" title="3.5 Instances, Documents, Views">3.5 Instances, Documents, Views</a></strong></span>), that window will have its own independent list of selected objects. Selected objects can be anywhere on the canvas, in any layer or group; multiple selected objects don’t have to be children of the same parent. The only thing you <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> do is select an object and its ancestor at the same time (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch05s10.html" title="5.10 Selecting in Groups">5.10 Selecting in Groups</a></strong></span>).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05note01"/>Note</h3><p><a id="iddle1039" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1192" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1355" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1431" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1668" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1784" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1930" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1988" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2045" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2352" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2629" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2635" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2636" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2637" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2639" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2644" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2651" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2652" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2654" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2665" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2666" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2675" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2679" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2681" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2967" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3108" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3129" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3223" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3480" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3503" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3660" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3980" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4037" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4053" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4092" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4228" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4285" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4318" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4672" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4824" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4947" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4970" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5011" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Even hidden or locked objects can be included in the selection.

By default, this cue is a dashed frame around the object, showing that object’s bounding box (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html" title="4.2 The Bounding Box">4.2 The Bounding Box</a></strong></span>).

For this, look for checkboxes labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Show selection cue</strong></span> on each tool’s page in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog. By default, every tool shows the selection cue, except for the Calligraphic pen and Paint bucket tools, which are more artistic than technical—there, the cue is not very useful and may be a distraction. (Of course, the selection is still there whether the cue is displayed or not—it remains the same now matter how much you switch tools.)</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.2 Selection and the Status Bar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot2_selection_and_the_status_bar"/>5.2 Selection and the Status Bar</h1></div></div></div><p>A lot of things happen throughout the program when you select or deselect objects. Inkscape instantly redirects all its attention to the new selection: It redraws the selection cues, scrolls the canvas to show the selected objects if necessary (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s10.html" title="3.10 Panning">3.10 Panning</a></strong></span>), and updates various displays and indicators all over the interface.</p><p>One of the most important sources of hints in Inkscape, the status bar, displays as much information about the selection as is reasonably possible to fit into it. For a single selected object, it tells you the type of the object, certain additional properties for some of the types (such as the number of nodes for paths, font family and size for texts), and the layer in which this object resides, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05s02.html#status_bar_description_of_a_single_selec" title="Figure 5-2. Status bar description of a single selected object">Figure 5-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="status_bar_description_of_a_single_selec"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00051"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735542.png.jpg" alt="Status bar description of a single selected object"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-2. Status bar description of a single selected object</p></div><p><a id="iddle1745" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2341" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2739" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3907" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3911" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3950" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3969" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3984" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4013" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4047" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4421" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4456" class="indexterm"/>For multiple selections, Inkscape tells you how many objects are selected and, if there are no more than three different types of object selected, lists these types:</p><div class="figure"><a id="status_bar_description_of_multiple_selec"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00052"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735544.png.jpg" alt="Status bar description of multiple selected objects"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-3. Status bar description of multiple selected objects</p></div><p>If there are too many object types to list and they are in more than one layer, Inkscape just gives you the number of objects, object types, and layers:</p><div class="figure"><a id="status_bar_description_of_multip-id00001"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00053"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735546.png.jpg" alt="Status bar description of multiple selected objects of multiple types in multiple layers"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-4. Status bar description of multiple selected objects of multiple types in multiple layers</p></div><p>To the left of the status bar message area is the current layer indicator (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html#fourdot6dot3_the_current_layer_indicator" title="4.6.3 The Current Layer Indicator">4.6.3 The Current Layer Indicator</a></strong></span>). Since selected objects can be located in many layers, this widget is not directly connected to the selection. However, when you select an object by clicking, Inkscape assumes that you now want to work in that object’s layer, so it makes that layer current, which the indicator reflects.</p><p>Further to the left is the <span class="emphasis"><em>selected style indicator</em></span>, which always reflects the style of the current selection (if many objects with different styles are selected, it displays their <span class="emphasis"><em>averaged</em></span> style). We will discuss this important widget in detail in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s01.html" title="8.1 Style Fundamentals">8.1 Style Fundamentals</a></strong></span>.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.3 Subselection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot3_subselection"/>5.3 Subselection</h1></div></div></div><p>Some tools allow a finer-grained type of selection, so that they can work on a part of a selected object rather than the entire object. This selected part of a selected object is then called the <span class="emphasis"><em>subselection</em></span>.</p><p>One example is the Text tool. You can select an entire text object, but then you can select a <span class="emphasis"><em>fragment</em></span> of text inside that text object by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00142"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and an arrow key or by dragging the mouse just like you do in a text editor (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15s01.html#one5dot1dot1_selecting" title="15.1.1 Selecting">15.1.1 Selecting</a></strong></span>). That selected part of the text is the text subselection.</p><p>Another example is the Gradient tool. A gradient can have many stops (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10s05.html" title="10.5 Multistage Gradients">10.5 Multistage Gradients</a></strong></span>), and the tool can select one or more of these stops at a time. Naturally, gradient stops are only visible for selected objects, so if you select one stop, you’re creating a subselection within the regular object selection.</p><p>When you change subselections, many things in Inkscape behave the same as when you change selections. Perhaps most importantly, the selected style indicator in the status bar (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s01.html" title="8.1 Style Fundamentals">8.1 Style Fundamentals</a></strong></span>) displays the style of the subselection—that is, the style of the selected text fragment and not the entire text, or the style of the selected gradient stop and not the entire object. Also, any style setting commands (such as clicking a color on the palette, or pasting a style by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00143"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735400.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) will apply to the subselection if it is present. In other words, subselection allows you to deal with parts of your objects almost as though they are separate objects in their own right.</p></div>

Of course, there is much more to the Selector tool than that, but let’s look at this simple action in more detail.</p><p>First, note that clicking an object <span class="emphasis"><em>deselects</em></span> any previous selection. Also, observe that with the Selector tool, you can not only select objects, but also <span class="emphasis"><em>drag</em></span> the selected objects in any direction. Combined, these two features make it extremely easy and natural to move objects around, almost without thinking about “selection” at all: You see an object, and you click and drag it to where you want it. The click selects it, deselecting anything else, and the drag moves it.</p><p>Sometimes, this may be an annoyance. Especially if you use a tablet with a pen and not a mouse, you may find that it’s too easy to accidentally nudge an object when all you intended to do was just select it by clicking. To make this less of a problem, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Mouse</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog and adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Click/drag threshold</strong></span> value. This sets the allowed “slippage” in screen pixels, the default being 4; if you click and drag an object by less than this many pixels, your action is still considered a click and the object does not move. Increase this value if you often end up accidentally moving objects instead of clicking them; conversely, decrease it if you find that objects annoyingly “stick” more than you like when you really want to move them.</p><p>Before you can click anything, however, you want to be sure that you’re clicking in the right place so that your click will not be wasted. Here, Inkscape is very helpful: It changes your mouse cursor when you are over a clickable area of an object, as opposed to an empty canvas where the cursor is an arrow. The exact shape of the over-the-object cursor is different on different platforms; for example, on Ubuntu Linux it looks like a hand, while on Windows it looks like a cross with arrows on the ends.</p><p>Play with this cursor-changing capability a little. You will discover that objects with no fill cannot be selected by clicking inside them and that fully transparent objects are not selectable by clicking at all (although you can select them with the rubber band, as you’ll see in the next section). In Outline mode (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s11.html" title="3.11 Rendering Modes">3.11 Rendering Modes</a></strong></span>), you can select any object only by clicking its outline.</p><p>As you can imagine, this changing cursor is less helpful in complex drawings where the entire canvas is often covered with objects. However, if you separate all the background objects into a layer and lock that layer (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html" title="4.6 Layers">4.6 Layers</a></strong></span>), then these background objects, now unselectable, will stop changing the cursor—and you can again sense the foreground objects by moving your mouse over them.</p><p>Also, you will notice that every clickable object has an invisible margin, several pixels wide, on all sides. A click in that margin will still select that object. This is very handy for selecting small objects which would otherwise be almost impossible to accurately click upon. On the downside, this also explains why it’s sometimes so difficult to select the bottom object in a stack even if that bottom object protrudes a little from under the top one.</p><p>If you don’t like the size of this clickable margin, you can change it on the <span class="strong"><strong>Mouse</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog: Adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Grab sensitivity</strong></span> value, <a id="iddle1040" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1669" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1989" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2353" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2457" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2968" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3661" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3785" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3942" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3946" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3947" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3951" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3954" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3959" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3963" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3966" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3970" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4003" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4008" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4040" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4229" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4286" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4673" class="indexterm"/>the default being 8 screen pixels. Note that both this value and the <span class="strong"><strong>Click/drag threshold</strong></span> are in screen pixels. This means they do not depend on zoom, so even if the values remain the same, you will find it much easier to perform small moves and select small objects simply by zooming in.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.5 Selecting by Clicking: Other Tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot5_selecting_by_clicking_other_too"/>5.5 Selecting by Clicking: Other Tools</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the most important principles of Inkscape’s user interface is consistency: Unless there’s a reason to do otherwise, all tools and modes must behave the same. In selecting, this means that many tools, just like the Selector, can select an object by clicking it.</p><p>The tools in which clicking to select works are: Node (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html" title="12.5 The Node Tool">12.5 The Node Tool</a></strong></span>), all of the shape tools (<a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Shapes">Chapter 11</a>), Text (<a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Text">Chapter 15</a>), Connector (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html" title="1.2 What Can You Do with Inkscape?">1.2 What Can You Do with Inkscape?</a></strong></span>), and Gradient (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10s01.html" title="10.1 The Gradient Tool">10.1 The Gradient Tool</a></strong></span>). (The tools that <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> select by clicking are different for a reason: In those tools, a single click is reserved for a different function specific to each tool.)</p><p>Unlike the Selector, all these tools directly select individual objects, even if they are inside groups (in other words, in these tools simple clicking is equivalent to <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00144"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking in the Selector, see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch05s10.html" title="5.10 Selecting in Groups">5.10 Selecting in Groups</a></strong></span>). This makes sense: All of these tools work on individual objects of various types, so in most cases selecting a group is not what you really want to do. For example, if you select a group with the Node tool, you would not be able to do anything useful with it—a group has no path nodes to edit. That’s why this tool always directly selects the <span class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span> you clicked, regardless of whether it is grouped with anything else or not.</p><p>Also, unlike the Selector, other tools don’t change the cursor over selectable objects. The only exception is the Text tool, which switches to the text insertion cursor when over an editable text object (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15s01.html" title="15.1 Basic Editing">15.1 Basic Editing</a></strong></span>).</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.6 Adding to a Selection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot6_adding_to_a_selection"/>5.6 Adding to a Selection</h1></div></div></div><p>A selection may contain more than one object. Sometimes, you have spent some effort selecting several objects, and then you want to select a few other objects as well. Can you do that without starting the selection all over again?</p><p>Yes. To <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> another object to the current selection, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00145"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click it. If, however, you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00146"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click an already selected object, it will be <span class="emphasis"><em>removed</em></span> from selection. In other words, this shortcut works as a toggle that reverses the selected status of the object on which you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00147"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.7 Selecting with the Rubber Band"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot7_selecting_with_the_rubber_band"/>5.7 Selecting with the Rubber Band</h1></div></div></div><p>Another way to select multiple objects in the Selector is by dragging around them. Imagine a rectangle surrounding all the objects you want to select and drag from one corner of that rectangle to the opposite corner. (The exact direction of the drag—top left to bottom right versus top right to bottom left, for example—does not matter.) This rectangle (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05s07.html#using_the_rubber_band_left_parenthesismo" title="Figure 5-5. Using the rubber band (mouse drag) to select multiple objects">Figure 5-5</a>), which is visible while you’re dragging, is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>rubber band</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>marquee</em></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_the_rubber_band_left_parenthesismo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00054"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735548.png.jpg" alt="Using the rubber band (mouse drag) to select multiple objects"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-5. Using the rubber band (mouse drag) to select multiple objects</p></div><p><a id="iddle1118" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1353" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1443" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1703" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1906" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2733" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3109" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3124" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3130" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3981" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3990" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4014" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4021" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4077" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4709" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4948" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5025" class="indexterm"/>Selecting by rubber band is <span class="emphasis"><em>not a toggle</em></span>; once you start a new rubber band, any previous selection is deselected. This is why, logically, single-clicking on empty space (not an object) deselects anything—this is just a zero-size rubber band that deselects the old selection but does not create a new one.</p><p>The rubber band selects enclosed objects in all visible and unlocked layers—in other words, across the z-order stack of the entire document, not the current layer only. (For this reason, selecting by rubber band does not change the current layer, even if it resulted in selecting a single object in a layer different from the current one.) Also, the rubber band allows you to select those objects that you cannot select simply by clicking them—those that are underneath others, those without fill and stroke, and those that are made fully transparent (with zero opacity). However, objects that are hidden or locked (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s01.html" title="4.1 Object Properties">4.1 Object Properties</a></strong></span>) still cannot be selected.</p><p>In short, if the object’s bounding box is completely inside the rubber band rectangle and that object is at all selectable, it <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> get selected.</p><div class="note" title="AI"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05note02"/>AI</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In Adobe Illustrator, rubber band works slightly differently: It selects all objects whose bounding box lies within</em></span> or intersects <span class="emphasis"><em>its rectangle.

This is not the case, however. Pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00149"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and dragging with the Selector tool works exactly like simple dragging with one exception: It always creates a rubber band, even if you start from an object and not from an empty canvas. Without <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00150"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, dragging from an object will simply select and move that object, but pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00151"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and dragging <span class="emphasis"><em>forces</em></span> the rubber band, and thus makes it a lot more useful in complex drawings where empty canvas may be hard to come by.</p></div>

But what if you already have some selection and want to <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> to it by touch selection?

The touched objects are then <span class="emphasis"><em>added</em></span> to selection.</p><p>If you touch objects so that you can then delete them, the Delete mode of the Eraser tool performs both functions at once: Drag over objects and get them deleted once you release the mouse.

<div class="sect1" title="5.9 Selecting Objects from Underneath"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot9_selecting_objects_from_undernea"/>5.9 Selecting Objects from Underneath</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the most common problems with selecting objects in complex drawings is that some objects obscure others. Even if the top object is partially transparent and you can see another object underneath, simply clicking it will still select the top object.</p><p>If the bounding box of the bottom object is smaller than that of the top one, you can <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00159"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag a rubber band around the small bottom object, and this will select it without selecting the top object. However, this is not always possible.</p><p>Inkscape offers a convenient way to select objects that are not at the top of the z-order: <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00160"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click <span class="emphasis"><em>selects under</em></span> the currently selected object. This means that the result of an <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00161"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click depends on the current selection; if nothing is selected, <a id="iddle2441" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2456" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2458" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3941" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4041" class="indexterm"/>or if you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00162"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click outside the current selection, the result is the same as if you simply clicked without <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00163"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>.</p><p>If, however, you click a selected object and there are other objects underneath it, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00164"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click will deselect the selected object and instead select the object immediately beneath it. The next <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00165"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click will select a still deeper object, and so on. When you reach the bottommost object at the click point, the next <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00166"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click again selects the topmost one.</p><p>For example, suppose you have three stacked objects, numbered 1, 2, 3, from bottom to top. With nothing selected, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00167"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking them selects the topmost one, 3. The next <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00168"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click selects 2, then 1, then 3 again, and so on.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00169"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735554.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click differs from <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00170"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click in the same way <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00171"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click differs from a simple click: It adds to the selection or removes from it without unselecting it completely. So, in our 1, 2, 3 stack of objects, the first <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00172"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735554.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click selects 3; after another <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00173"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735554.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click you will have 2 and 3 selected; finally, one more <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00174"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735554.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click adds the bottommost object to the selection as well—so, after three <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00175"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735554.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicks you will have all of 1, 2, and 3 selected.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.10 Selecting in Groups"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot10_selecting_in_groups"/>5.10 Selecting in Groups</h1></div></div></div><p>Grouping is a wonderful thing when you need to treat a collection of objects as a whole. If you simply click any object in a group with the Selector tool, the entire group gets selected. However, quite often you want to select and edit an object inside a group without ungrouping it. This is possible by <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00176"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking an object in a group.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00177"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking completely ignores <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> grouping, no matter how many levels deep it is. For example, if object A is a member of group B which, in turn, is a member of top-level group C, then <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00178"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking A will select A, cutting right through both levels of grouping. There’s no way to select group B by <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00179"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking; it will always select only the lowest-level nongroup object.</p><p>The only way to select group B, which is inside group C, is by <span class="emphasis"><em>entering</em></span> group C (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html#fourdot6dot1_layer_hierarchy" title="4.6.1 Layer Hierarchy">4.6.1 Layer Hierarchy</a></strong></span>). Entering C makes it a temporary layer. Once in that layer, you can select B by simply clicking.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00180"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click can be combined with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00181"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> (select under). Logically, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00182"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735556.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click does the same thing as <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00183"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click, except that it disregards any groupings and browses through the z-order stack of objects at the click point as if they were all ungrouped.</p><p>Similarly, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00184"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click can be combined with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00185"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to add an object to selection or remove it from selection. Finally, you can <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00186"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735558.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click, which means “Add to selection the topmost nonselected object in the z-order stack at this point, ignoring grouping; if all objects at this point are selected, deselect the topmost one.”</p><p>The only limitation to the power of selecting by clicking with various modifiers is this: You cannot have both an object and a group which contains that object selected at the same time. So, for example, if you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00187"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click an object inside a group and then <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00188"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click (without <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00189"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> !) another object of the same group, thus trying to add the group to the selection, the group becomes selected, but the first selected object is deselected. A situation where both a group and an <a id="iddle2662" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2734" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3987" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5016" class="indexterm"/>object inside that group are selected at the same time would lead to various logical impasses, so Inkscape does its best to prevent this from happening.</p></div>

However, keyboard shortcuts can also be used for two very common selection operations: selecting the <span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>previous object</em></span> (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00190"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735366.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00191"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735368.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and selecting <span class="emphasis"><em>all objects</em></span> (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00192"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735370.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>).</p><p>The concepts of <span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>previous</em></span> actually refer to the z-order of objects inside the document (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title="4.3 Z-Order">4.3 Z-Order</a></strong></span>). When you press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00193"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735366.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, you select the object immediately <span class="emphasis"><em>above</em></span> the currently selected object in the z-order (or above the topmost selected object, if several objects are selected). Correspondingly, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00194"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735368.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> selects the object immediately <span class="emphasis"><em>below</em></span> the (bottommost) selected object.</p><p>If nothing was selected, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00195"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735366.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> selects the bottommost object in the current layer, and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00196"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735368.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> selects the topmost one. Since objects are typically added to the top of the current layer’s z-order, pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00197"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735368.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> with no previous selection is therefore a convenient shortcut for selecting the most recently added (drawn, pasted, imported, etc.) object.</p><p>Some aspects of the behavior of these three shortcuts can be changed on the <span class="strong"><strong>Selecting</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog:</p><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_tab_of_the_inkscape_preference"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00056"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735560.png.jpg" alt="The Selecting tab of the Inkscape Preferences dialog"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-7. The Selecting tab of the Inkscape Preferences dialog</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>By default, these keys are limited to the current layer (which may be a group that you have entered, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html#fourdot6dot1_layer_hierarchy" title="4.6.1 Layer Hierarchy">4.6.1 Layer Hierarchy</a></strong></span>).

<div class="sect1" title="5.13 Following Links"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot13_following_links"/>5.13 Following Links</h1></div></div></div><p>As you will see in the following chapters, objects in Inkscape can be linked to each other in various ways. You will often want to follow such links to find the object to which your current selected object is linked. Inkscape has a universal keyboard shortcut for this, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00204"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735568.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. Depending on what kind of object is selected, pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00205"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735568.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> will select:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The original of a clone (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16s04.html" title="16.4 Chaining Clones">16.4 Chaining Clones</a></strong></span>), if a clone is selected</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The path to which the selected text-on-path object is attached (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#one5dot2dot3_text_on_a_path" title="15.2.3 Text on a Path">15.2.3 Text on a Path</a></strong></span>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The path to which the selected linked offset object is attached (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s04.html" title="12.4 Offsetting">12.4 Offsetting</a></strong></span>)</p></li></ul></div><p>Remember that some of the document objects may be stored in the <code class="literal">defs</code> (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="apas04.html" title="A.4 Defs, View, and Metadata">A.4 Defs, View, and Metadata</a></strong></span>), in which case they can be referenced from the document but are not visible anywhere on the canvas. If your on-screen clone, text-on-path, or linked offset refers to an object in <code class="literal">defs</code>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00206"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735568.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> will fail with an error message in the status bar.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.14 Deselecting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot14_deselecting"/>5.14 Deselecting</h1></div></div></div><p>In almost any tool, context, or mode, pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00207"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735372.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> will deselect the current selection. If you have a subselection, typically pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00208"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735372.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> once will deselect the subselection and the second <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00209"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735372.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> will deselect the regular selection.</p><p>Another way to deselect is by clicking the empty canvas (or a locked object with nothing underneath it). This, however, works only in Selector and in those tools where a simple click selects objects (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html" title="5.5 Selecting by Clicking: Other Tools">5.5 Selecting by Clicking: Other Tools</a></strong></span>). In complex drawings where accessing empty canvas may be difficult, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00210"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735372.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> is by far the most convenient way to deselect.</p><p>Also, by default Inkscape deselects when you switch the current layer (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html" title="4.6 Layers">4.6 Layers</a></strong></span>). This can be disabled on the <span class="strong"><strong>Selecting</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="5.15 Selection Miscellany"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fivedot15_selection_miscellany"/>5.15 Selection Miscellany</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1645" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1854" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2101" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2569" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3114" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3996" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4852" class="indexterm"/>When you undo an action, sometimes, though not always, the current selection is deselected. (Whether this happens or not depends on what kind of action you’re undoing.) This is not the intended behavior; in fact it is a bug, and future versions of Inkscape are likely to fix it.</p><p>Another similar problem is that selection is often lost after an extension (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch13s03.html" title="13.3 Path Extensions">13.3 Path Extensions</a></strong></span>) is run. Moreover, if an extension opens a configuration dialog and in it, you check the <span class="strong"><strong>Live preview</strong></span> checkbox, you cannot change selection (or do anything else on the canvas) while that dialog is open.</p><p>Inkscape’s powerful command-line interface has a special parameter for selecting objects, <code class="literal">--select</code> (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="apcs05.html" title="C.5 Verbs">C.5 Verbs</a></strong></span>). To use it, you need to know the IDs of the objects you want to select. This makes it possible to script fully automated Inkscape editing sessions where a single command loads a document, selects some objects, performs some actions on them, saves the document, and quits—all without any user interaction.</p></div></body></html>
