</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you know that Linux rocks, it is  time to don that beret of yours and move on  to the artistic side of Linux. Yes, Linux does  art, and as you will soon find out, there are a  good number of programs on your system that  allow you to create and manipulate graphic files. The  most notable (and famous) of these applications is the  GIMP, which you might think of as the Linux equivalent  of Adobe Photoshop. To run the GIMP, just go to the  Main menu, and select <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> The GIMP</b>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GIMP allows you to create bitmap graphics and, quite importantly, retouch or  completely doctor image files, such as those from your digital camera. (Want to put  some color in your cheeks, you say?) With the GIMP you can get rid of red-eye in your </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">digital photos, airbrush out unwanted shadows (or even facial blemishes), give  your image a canvas texture, change a photo into an oil painting, and even add a  bell pepper here and there (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU142">Figure 14-1</a>).</p>

<span><span>Figure 14-1: </span> Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GIMP is also a very handy tool for resizing images. This can easily be done by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then selecting <b class="calibre13">Image </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  Scale Image</b> in the pop-up menu. This will bring up the Scale Image window,  where you can set the new size of the image. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GIMP is also an excellent tool for converting images from one file  format to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (.bmp) file and save it  as a PNG (.png) file, or save a JPEG (.jpg) file as a GIF (.gif) file, and so on. The  GIMP supports an extremely wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save  an image file as a compressed tarball. To perform a file conversion, just right- click an image opened within the GIMP and then select <b class="calibre13">File </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Save As</b> in the  pop-up menu. This will bring up a dialog box in which you can specify the new file format by replacing the original file extension in the <b class="calibre13">Selection</b> box at the  bottom of the window with the extension for the format you want to convert the  image to. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It is lots of fun to learn to use the GIMP by just playing around with it for a  while. Of course, you should make a backup copy of any file you are planning  to experiment with before doing so. If you prefer working through tutorials to  just finding things out by goofing around, the GIMP Documentation page(<a target="_top" href="http://www.gimp.org/tutorials.html">www.gimp.org/tutorials.html</a>) has a number of links to tutorials covering  various functions, features, and skill levels. In my opinion, the best of these is the GIMP Tutorials page (<a target="_top" href="http://empyrean.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/">http://empyrean.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/</a> gimp/tuts).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you don’t really need all the power that the GIMP provides, and you are  instead just looking for something simple for the kids to paint with (or even for  when you just want to whip out a quick doodle or two), you can always try KPaint,  which is a very lightweight equivalent of Windows Paint or MacPaint from the  early Macintosh days (both lightweight programs, themselves). KPaint comes as  part of your Fedora Core system, and it can be run by going to the Main menu  and selecting<b class="calibre13"> Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More Graphics Applications </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Paint Program</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you would like something a bit more fun and attractive, you should check  out Tux Paint (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU143">Figure 14-2</a>). Tux Paint is a very easy-to-use, kids-oriented  paint program with a highly intuitive and attractive interface that anyone of  almost any age can get the hang of after a minute of use (slightly more, perhaps,  for the real young’uns). If you also download and install the separate rubber  stamps package, you or your kids can stamp all sorts of odd things all over the  page: tropical fish, penguins, nickels, dimes, Euros, clothespins, and even bell  peppers, like in the GIMP. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GIMP, like other so-called paint programs, creates bitmap (.bmp) images.  These are images in which the location and color of every single pixel is  recorded. The image is essentially a collection of dots, or bits. The file you create  is thus a rather hefty map of these bits (hence its name), and this map tells your  system where everything in your image is supposed to go when it is displayed or  printed. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Drawing programs, on the other hand, create vector images, or drawings.  The vector image file is a collection of mathematical formulae representing the  various shapes in your image. This may sound rather unimportant to you, but  such drawings have advantages in certain cases. One of these advantages is that  vector image files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another,  and perhaps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain  their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as a  bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges (the jaggies) when enlarged to any extent, while the same circle in a vector image would remain  smooth and round no matter how much you increased its size.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fedora comes with a couple of programs that are called drawing programs  (OpenOffice.org Draw and Dia), but these are really more appropriate for  creating simple flyers and diagrams, as you will see later in this chapter. My pick  for the easiest-to-use drawing program for creating true graphics is Sodipodi —  the name is Estonian for mishmash (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU144">Figure 14-3</a>). </p>

There are limitations to what Nautilus can do, however, so it is time for you  to become acquainted with another program that comes with your Fedora Core  system: gThumb (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU145">Figure 14-4</a> on the next page).

<span><span>Figure 14-4: </span> Viewing images in a folder with gThumb</span>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once gThumb is up and running, you will want to direct it to the folder  where you keep your images. You can do this by clicking the folder icons in the  left panel of the program window, or by typing in the location in the location box  above the left panel (<span>/home/username/Photos </span>if you created the folders I told you to  in <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>).

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">So what? Well, gThumb also lets you resize an image, adjust the brightness  and contrast of that image, and even rotate it by simply clicking the image you  want to modify and then selecting from the various choices in the <b class="calibre13">Image</b> menu.  You can also change the file format of a given file in gThumb (from .jpg to .png, for example), though without the various options available when doing the same  in the GIMP. Finally, if you want to print out one of your images, doing so via  gThumb is extremely easy.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the first things my mother asked me after she got Linux up and running was how to create her own emblems. You already learned how to deal with  emblems in <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>, but now that I have introduced many of the graphics tools  at your disposal, it might be a good time to address my mother’s question as well.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Probably the easiest way to get started creating emblems is to use one of the icons  on your system as an emblem. The only problem with that idea is that most of  your system icons are 48 by 48 pixels in size, while emblems are 36 by 36 pixels. If  you don’t want your new emblem to look weirdly oversized and out of place, it is  best to resize it.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned in the <a href="DDU0105.html#637" target="_parent">previous section</a>, the gThumb application is very  handy for resizing images. For this project, we will use the <b class="calibre13">gnome-tigert</b> icon, so  in the left pane of the gThumb window, navigate to <b class="calibre13">/usr/share/pixmaps</b>. Once  there, look for the <b class="calibre13">gnome-tigert.png</b> file, click it once, and then go to the <b class="calibre13">Image  </b>menu and select <b class="calibre13">Resize</b>. This will bring up the Scale Image window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU146">Figure  14-5</a>) where you can change the width of the icon to 36 pixels (the height will  change automatically, as long as the <b class="calibre13">Keep aspect ratio</b> box is checked).

Save the file as <span>gnome-tigert_emblem.png</span> in  your Home folder. You can do this either by navigating through the folders in  that window or by changing the text in the Selection box at the bottom of that  window from <span>gnome-tigert.png</span> to <span>/home/username/gnome-tigert_emblem.png</span>.

Then, once you are logged in and ready, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Scanning</b>. This will bring up the Sane scanning program. If  Sane can recognize your scanner as is, the main program windows will open (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU150">Figure 14-9</a>), and you can begin scanning. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If Sane cannot recognize your scanner, or if you are trying to figure out what type of scanner to buy, you will probably want to go to the Sane Web site to see what  scanners are supported, or if you can get yours to work with a little tweaking.  The URL for the Sane hardware support page is <a target="_top" href="http://www.sane-project.org/sanemfgs.html">www.sane-project.org/sanemfgs.html.</a> <a name="653" id="653"/><a name="IDX-203" id="IDX-203"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your scanner is part of one of Hewlett-Packard’s all-in-one scanner/printer  combinations (a multifunction device) you will need to install <b class="calibre13">libsane-hpoj</b>,  which you can install via the Package Management window, which you learned  to use in <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a>.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While scanner support for Linux is still a bit spotty, support for digital cameras is  significantly better. Linux supports over 400 cameras through the gPhoto2  digital camera software package, which is a part of the default installation in  Fedora Core. To see if your camera is supported, go to the gPhoto2 project page  (<a target="_top" href="http://www.gphoto.org">www.gphoto.org</a>), and scroll down and click the link that says <b class="calibre13">400 cameras</b>.  Once on that page you will find a complete list of all the cameras supported by  gPhoto2. If your camera isn’t on the list, it most likely means (as that page points  out) that your camera is so old that there is little demand for support for it or  that it is so new that there hasn’t been enough time to develop support for it. Of  course, gPhoto2 is constantly being updated, so if your camera isn’t on the list  now, it could very well be so in the future. Updating gPhoto2 with Synaptic now  and again, should keep you as up to date as possible.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your camera is not currently supported by gPhoto2 and you really want to  get cracking right away, all is not lost because you can still get your images to your  hard disk by setting up your system to work with a USB flash memory card reader, as I discussed in <a href="DDU0089_split_000.html#520" target="_parent">Chapter 12</a>. After adding your card reader to your system’s <i class="calibre11">fstab  </i>file, remove the flash media card from your camera, pop it into your USB card  reader, and then mount the reader by right-clicking your desktop and selecting <b class="calibre13">Disks </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> cardreader</b> (or whatever you named it). Once you’ve done that, it is a  simple drag-and-drop process to get the images to your hard disk. Of course, you  can use this method even if your camera is supported, which I think is the easiest  way to deal with things.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your camera is supported by gPhoto2, and you prefer to access your photos  directly from your camera rather than fiddle with flash storage cards, then gtKam  is the program to use. The gtKam program is essentially a graphical front end to  gPhoto2 and is also installed by default in Fedora Core. Before running gtKam,  however, you need to connect your camera to your computer, usually via a USB  cable. Once you’ve done that, turn your camera on and set it to communicate  with your computer. Switching the camera to <b class="calibre13">Play</b>, rather than <b class="calibre13">Camera</b>, mode  usually seems to do the trick, but you should check your owner’s manual just to  be sure.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once your camera is connected and set, you can run gtKam by going to the  Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Digital Camera Tool</b>. The first time you run  gtKam, you will have to set it up to recognize your camera. This is quite easily  done by going to the <b class="calibre13">Camera</b> menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Add Camera</b>. Once you do this,  a small camera selection window (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU151">Figure 14-10</a>) will appear. The easiest way to go about things is to let gtKam find your camera itself by clicking the <b class="calibre13">Detect</b> button. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Within a second or two, gtKam will find your camera and select the appropriate  settings. Once it has done its job, just click<b class="calibre13"> Apply</b> and then <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. An icon for your  camera will then appear in the left pane of the gtKam window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that gtKam is ready, you can easily access your files by clicking the little +  symbol next to the camera icon in the left pane of the gtKam window. This will  reveal the folders that are present on the flash storage card in your camera.  Click any folder (or folders) you wish to view, and the contents will appear as  thumbnailed images in the right pane of the gtKam window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU152">Figure 14-11</a>). <a name="658" id="658"/><a name="IDX-205" id="IDX-205"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To copy images to your hard disk, first select the images you want to transfer by  clicking them one by one. If you want to copy them all, go to the <b class="calibre13">Select</b> menu  and choose <b class="calibre13">Select All</b>. Once you are done selecting your images, click the floppy  disk icon at the top left of the gtKam window. This will bring up a Save As  window. The default settings in this window should be fine enough, so just click  <b class="calibre13">OK</b> to complete the job. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can delete images from your camera just as easily by first selecting the  images you want to delete. Once done, click the trash can icon (to the right of the floppy disk icon). This will bring up a handy final confirmation window (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU153">Figure 14-12</a>). In that window, you can deal with any second thoughts you  might have by unchecking the box next to any file you don’t want to delete after  all. Once done, click <b class="calibre13">Delete</b>, and the files that are still selected will be gone for good.<a name="660" id="660"/><a name="IDX-206" id="IDX-206"/>
