Even those who deny being gamers often find themselves caught in the act of rapping off a quick round of solitaire between work projects. As a Linux user, you will most likely find that one of the most common questions you will be asked about Linux by users of other operating systems is, "What games does it have?" Well, although there might not be as many games in the Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1396" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Ubuntu, for example, comes with the games AisleRiot Solitaire (a collection of more than 80 solitaire card games), gbrainy (a collection of puzzles, memory trainers, and brain teasers, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#gbrainy" title="Figure 17-1. gbrainy">Figure 17-1</a>), Mahjongg (a tile-matching game, similar to the one introduced in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. SIMPLE KITTEN WAYS">Chapter 9</a>), Mines (the Linux world's answer to Minesweeper), Quadrapassel (a Tetris clone), and Sudoku.

One of the most well-known and well-liked of these is Frozen Bubble (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#frozen_bubble" title="Figure 17-4. Frozen Bubble">Figure 17-4</a>). Frozen Bubble qualifies as the ultimate Linux classic: It was written for Linux, it's Linux (penguin) themed, and Linux versions are always released first.

It's a rather odd (but fun) race-against-the-clock sort of game, in which you guide Tux as he slides down a long, icy mountain trail. You should be aware, however, that unless you have an accelerated graphics card, Extreme Tux Racer will run painfully slowly. If you're not sure whether your computer can handle it, just give it a shot and see for yourself—it's free, after all!<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1414" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1415" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To install Extreme Tux Racer, search the Ubuntu Software Center for <span class="emphasis"><em>extreme tux racer</em></span>, and install it.

It's a maze game, based on the old classic Lemmings. Your goal is to lead your group of adorable little penguins safely to the end of each level, without letting them be dashed to bits on the dangerous obstacles awaiting them. There are 22 playable levels included with the game, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can try playing some of the untested levels—there are more than 200 of them!

Sure, 2D games can be fun—I've certainly lost a significant portion of my life to Sudoku—but they don't have the excitement factor that you get from shooting hordes of aliens or crashing a high-powered sports car into a wall. Unfortunately, games designers have traditionally neglected Linux to concentrate on the significantly larger Windows market, so up until a couple of years ago there were few Linux-friendly 3D games to choose from. As the penguin has grown in popularity, however, people have started to take notice, and more Windows games now come with a Linux version.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1418" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1419" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1420" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The open source gaming community has come on leaps and bounds too, and there are some really high-quality games now. In this section I'll run through a few of my favorites, after first making sure that your computer can handle the strain of 3D graphics.</p><div class="sect2" title="Checking for Hardware Acceleration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="checking_for_hardware_acceleration"/>Checking for Hardware Acceleration</h2></div></div></div><p>To play 3D games, you need a graphics card that can handle <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware acceleration</em></span>. Without hardware acceleration, your computer's processor has to try to do all of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn't designed), so your games end up running at a snail's pace, if at all. Most modern graphics cards have some hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is enabled will depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find out how good 3D support is for your graphics card at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/</a>.</p><p>If you just want to know whether you have the minimum level of acceleration required to play games, then open a Terminal (<span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>), type <strong class="userinput"><code>glxinfo | grep rendering</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. (That vertical line is the "pipe" symbol and can normally be inserted by pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>shift</strong></span> and \ on your keyboard.) If you get a message telling you that glxinfo isn't installed, use the Ubuntu Software Center to install <span class="emphasis"><em>mesa-utils</em></span> and then try again.</p><p>If hardware acceleration is enabled, you'll see <code class="literal">direct rendering: Yes</code> appear in the Terminal. That's good news, because it means you can skip to the next section and sink your teeth into some three-dimensional gaming goodness.</p><p>If you received the message <code class="literal">direct rendering: No</code> instead, you'll need to install different graphics drivers if you want hardware acceleration to work.

In fact, I still have a soft spot for Doom, arguably the granddaddy of all FPSs. What could be more fun than battling endless waves of hellish monsters in a military outpost on Mars? Nothing!<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1421" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Doom looks a little dated nowadays, but if you have similarly nostalgic thoughts of this classic game, you'll be pleased to know that a version is available for Ubuntu. It's called Freedoom (<a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#freedoom" title="Figure 17-7. Freedoom">Figure 17-7</a>), and you can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center (like all the games in this section).<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1422" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1423" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="freedoom"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e21866"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656629.png.jpg" alt="Freedoom"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-7. Freedoom</p></div><p>The gameplay in Doom may have aged gracefully, but the graphics sure haven't. If pixilated blobs are failing to intimidate you, why not try something a little smoother, in the form of Nexuiz (<a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#nexuiz" title="Figure 17-8. Nexuiz">Figure 17-8</a>)? In terms of gameplay, Nexuiz feels quite similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect a wide array of weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting at opponents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most deathmatch-style games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are other game modes, like "capture the flag." There's also an online multiplayer option if you're finding that the computer-controlled opponents aren't providing enough of a challenge.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1424" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1425" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Tremulous (<a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#tremulous" title="Figure 17-9. Tremulous">Figure 17-9</a>) is another popular open source FPS, although its gameplay also contains elements of real-time strategy. You play online, taking the side of either humans or aliens. As you work to destroy the opposing team, you build structures and collect power-ups to gain as much of an advantage as you can. It can get quite involved, so I recommend that you read the notes at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tremulous.net/">http://www.tremulous.net/</a> before you begin playing.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1426" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1427" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="nexuiz"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e21904"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656631.png.jpg" alt="Nexuiz"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-8. Nexuiz</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="tremulous"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e21912"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656634.png.jpg" alt="Tremulous"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-9. Tremulous</p></div><p>Plenty of other FPSs are available: AssaultCube, Warsow, and Alien Arena immediately spring to mind.

You start off on a battleground with a small collection of vehicles, which you must command to build a base and defend it from enemies. Once your base is in good shape, you can build new units and send them to attack your foes. Your opponents are doing the same, however, so battles can turn into subtle tactical affairs, where your ability to launch successful attacks must be balanced against the limited availability of resources and the constant threat of your base being destroyed.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1428" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1429" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="warzone_2100"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e21947"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656636.png.jpg" alt="Warzone 2100"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-10. Warzone 2100</p></div><p>If you're struggling to find the time to mastermind an entire military campaign, perhaps Wormux (<a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#wormux" title="Figure 17-11. Wormux">Figure 17-11</a>) will be more your kind of thing. It's a clone of the popular Worms game, which sees you in command of a small team of heavily armed worms (or, in the case of Wormux, open source mascots like the Firefox fox) scattered around an oddly shaped landscape. You take turns, using your overstocked arsenal to remove opponents from the map in elaborate ways before they can do the same to you.

If this sounds like your sort of thing, Project 18C-3 will be of particular interest to you—a neat little app called PlayOnLinux (<a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#playonlinux_comma_displaying_a_list_of_s" title="Figure 17-16. PlayOnLinux, displaying a list of some of the Windows games it supports">Figure 17-16</a>) can be used to handle most of the fiddly configuration stuff that is often required to get less-well-supported games running under Wine.</p><div class="figure"><a id="playonlinux_comma_displaying_a_list_of_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e22135"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656649.png.jpg" alt="PlayOnLinux, displaying a list of some of the Windows games it supports"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-16. PlayOnLinux, displaying a list of some of the Windows games it supports</p></div></div></div>

As you have also learned, however, there are also many games beyond those in the Ubuntu Software Center. These include the games you worked with in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. SIMPLE KITTEN WAYS">Chapter 9</a> that were written in scripting languages, such as the Python-based pyWings and the Tcl/Tk–based Briscola, but it just wouldn't be right to leave out games written in what might be considered the mother of all scripting languages—Java. In this project, you'll learn how to install the Java Runtime Environment and how to install and run the Java-based version of a classic Austrian card game: Schnapsen.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1449" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1450" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1446" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1447" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1448" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="17B-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_installing_the_java_runtime_en"/>17B-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment</h2></div></div></div><p>To run Java-based applications, or <span class="emphasis"><em>scripts</em></span>, you need to first install the Java Runtime Environment. You can do this via the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for and installing <span class="emphasis"><em>openjdk java 6 runtime</em></span>. The whole set of Java packages is pretty hefty in terms of download weight, so don't get freaked out if it seems to take longer than usual. When the process is complete, close the Ubuntu Software Center, and move on to the next part of the project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="17B-2: Getting and Extracting Schnapsen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-2_colon_getting_and_extracting_schnaps"/>17B-2: Getting and Extracting Schnapsen</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you've installed the Java Runtime Environment, you need to run a Java application in order to see it at work.

Numerous websites allow you to play games online for free, as long as you have the proper browser plug-ins installed. (See <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#multimedia_plug-ins" title="Multimedia Plug-Ins">Multimedia Plug-Ins</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#keeping_up-to-date_with_live_bookmarks" title="Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks">Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks</a> for help installing plug-ins.) For example, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.popcap.com/">http://www.popcap.com/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://gametrick.net/">http://gametrick.net/</a> for some great online time-wasters. You can also play any of the games found on Facebook or other social networking sites, such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, without ever leaving the comfort of your Ubuntu desktop.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1453" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1454" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1455" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Searching for More Games"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="searching_for_more_games"/>Searching for More Games</h1></div></div></div><p>There are lots of other great games for Ubuntu that I haven't covered, but rest assured that they're out there. Some are available as DEB files, and can be installed in the same way you installed Skype in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a>. A good example is SDL Hana, a Linux version of the Japanese flower card game Hanafuda (<a class="xref" href="ch17s05.html#sdl_hana" title="Figure 17-19. SDL Hana">Figure 17-19</a>), which is available from <a class="ulink" href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/pr/sdlhana/">http://savannah.nongnu.org/pr/sdlhana/</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1456" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-1457" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="sdl_hana"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e22411"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656655.png.jpg" alt="SDL Hana"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-19. SDL Hana</p></div><p>Still more are available from the Ubuntu Software Center: Some of my old-time favorites include the Serbian Pac Man clone, Njam; and the Czech maze game, Fish Fillets NG, in which you guide two fish through all sorts of cumbersome, but very attractive, underwater locations.</p><p>There's plenty more available on the 3D side of things, too. In the beautifully designed Yo Frankie! (<a class="xref" href="ch17s05.html#yo_frankie_exclamation" title="Figure 17-20. Yo Frankie!">Figure 17-20</a>), you play an evil sheep-throwing squirrel called Frank, who runs through idyllic landscapes being chased by unfriendly animals—kids (and aesthetes) will love it. You can also lose yourself in the Balazar role-playing game, with plenty of magic and monsters to keep you company; fly a space fighter in 4D in Adanaxis (yes, they managed to squeeze an extra dimension in there, sort of); and race go-karts, penguin-style, in SuperTuxKart (<a class="xref" href="ch17s05.html#supertuxkart" title="Figure 17-21. SuperTuxKart">Figure 17-21</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-17-1458" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, you can just see what else there is in store for you by browsing the Ubuntu Software Center's Games category.
