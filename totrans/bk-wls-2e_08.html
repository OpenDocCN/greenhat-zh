Because Apple controls both ends of the network link—the access point and the network client—an AirPort network is a lot easier to set up than a generic Wi-Fi network. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0761"/>AirPort Extreme (Apple's name for its access point) automatically loads its Internet configuration settings from an existing Macintosh connection and transfers those settings to all the other computers on the same network.</p><p>Apple is a member of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0762"/>Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0763"/>WECA), and both the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0764"/>AirPort Extreme and the AirPort Extreme Card carry Wi-Fi certification. Therefore, a Macintosh with an AirPort card can join any Wi-Fi network almost as easily as it can join an AirPort network. A mixed-platform wireless network that includes Macs, Windows-based PCs, and Unix or Linux machines can use one or more AirPort Extremes as access points.</p><p>Apple uses different names for some of the features and functions in its wireless networks, but the general rules for designing, configuring, and using an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0765"/>AirPort network are the same as the rules for setting up generic wireless networks. The only difference between an AirPort network and any other Wi-Fi network is some of the terminology and the software that moves configuration data from a network client to the base station.</p><p>This chapter explains how to set up and use a wireless AirPort network on Macintosh computers, how to add a Macintosh with an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0766"/>AirPort Extreme Card to an existing Wi-Fi network that does not use an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0767"/>AirPort Extreme access point, and how to add a computer running Windows to an AirPort network.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="airport_components"/>AirPort Components</h1></div></div></div><p>The AirPort product family includes three components: wireless network adapters called the AirPort and the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0768"/>AirPort Extreme Card, and an access point called the AirPort Extreme.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>AirPort Extreme Card</em></span> is an internal Wi-Fi adapter that fits inside many Macintosh models.

But that's not the only possible way to use a wireless network with a Macintosh. Because the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0800"/>Setup Assistant automates the process, it's easier to connect Macs to an AirPort Extreme network than it is to build a mixed-platform <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0801"/> wireless network that can use access points, network adapters, and configuration software from different sources. AirPort Extreme Cards do meet the Wi-Fi specification for interoperability, so they can also communicate with Wi-Fi access points made by many other manufacturers (and in ad hoc networks with other Wi-Fi adapters). Therefore, it is not a problem to use a Macintosh computer in a new or existing wireless network that also includes network clients that run Windows or other operating systems.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0802"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0803"/></p><p>For example, PowerBook and MacBook owners who carry their computers to offices and public spaces served by Wi-Fi hot spots can connect to those networks just as easily as the owners of Windows-based laptop computers, and a wireless network in an office or household can provide service to both Macs and PCs without any changes to the network configuration.</p></div>

So it's likely that most people and most businesses that use an AirPort Extreme will have one or more Macintoshes in their <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0832"/>networks. Therefore, the Macintosh Admin Utility is generally the best choice for setting up an AirPort Extreme network.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0833"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0834"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0835"/></p><p>However, Apple also offers free software that you can use to set up and run an AirPort Extreme network from a computer running Windows. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0836"/>AirPort Express Assistant, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html#the_airport_express_assistant_for_window" title="Figure 8-4. The AirPort Express Assistant for Windows provides a step-by-step process for setting up an AirPort Extreme network.">Figure 8-4</a>, is part of the free AirPort for Windows package, available for download from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airport42forwindows.html">http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airport42forwindows.html</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_airport_express_assistant_for_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9144"/><img alt="The AirPort Express Assistant for Windows provides a step-by-step process for setting up an AirPort Extreme network." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254742.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 8-4. The AirPort Express Assistant for Windows provides a step-by-step process for setting up an AirPort Extreme network.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="is_airport_the_answer"/>Is AirPort the Answer?</h1></div></div></div><p>Because Apple could control both ends of its AirPort design—the access point and the network clients—it has come up with a system that automates the configuration hassles that confront many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0837"/>other Wi-Fi networks. And once you know the secret handshake (in the form of AirPort's oddball names for some standard features and functions), your Windows and Linux/Unix computers with other manufacturers' network adapters will also work perfectly well on an AirPort network.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0838"/></p><p>An AirPort network is indeed the obvious choice for a wireless network in a business or household where most of the computers are Macintoshes. For the rest of us, the AirPort Extreme is a completely adequate access point, but it's considerably more expensive than many other brands, so some other type of access point can generally provide similar performance at lower cost.</p><p>Keep in mind that AirPort Extreme is not your only choice if your PowerBook or desktop Mac didn't come with a built-in Wi-Fi adapter. Other makers' PC Cards and USB Wi-Fi adapters, combined with third-party drivers and control software, will allow you to add your Macintosh to a Wi-Fi network just as well as the more expensive Apple products do.</p></div></body></html>
