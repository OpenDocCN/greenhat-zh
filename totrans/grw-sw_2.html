      at the heart of the intellectual property of the company. Superior
      product definition leads to superior product, and good technical tools

<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="defining_the_product"/>Chapter 5. DEFINING THE PRODUCT</h1></div></div></div><p>At its core, a <span class="emphasis"><em>product definition</em></span> is not a
      knowledge or resource issue; it is a <span class="emphasis"><em>relationship</em></span>
      issue. When you and your development team build strong <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0238"/>relationships with marketing staff and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0239"/>with your customers, defining the product becomes much
      simpler. Open and regular communication with members of other teams can
      help you align your development goals with company goals. In addition,
      developing trust among corporate divisions as well as between the
      company and its customers can result in a quicker consensus on the most
      appropriate product definition.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0240"/></p><p>Some of the most difficult relationship strains occur between
      marketing and development teams. Establishing a positive relationship
      between these teams can be challenging, because the roles played by
      marketing and engineering staff are very different. Marketing's function
      is to understand customer needs and promise the solutions required to
      meet those needs.</p><p>Engineering's role emphasizes the practical aspects of building
      products efficiently and then supporting them after they are built.
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0241"/>With a strong relationship between the two teams, they can
      work together to devise the best and most balanced solutions to meet the
      customer's and company's needs.</p><p>This chapter covers the basics of defining a product. You'll learn
      about crucial <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0242"/>relationships, study example <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0243"/>processes for creating <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0244"/>product definitions, read about what goes into a
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0245"/>product definition, and learn a bit about prototyping and
      how to use templates to help define a product. In addition, you'll learn
      how products are put together and how different partners in the
      relationship perceive the product.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="product_definition_process"/>Product Definition Process</h1></div></div></div><p>Creating a refined product definition can be a challenge for
        companies for several reasons: The number of options surpasses the
        company's ability to build them, information is lacking, and the
        relationships between marketing and engineering are weak. However, if
        the marketing and engineering teams' relationship can be improved,
        they can work together to define the product through a process of
        high-level reviews and quick cost assessments.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0246"/></p><p>Creating a joint and cooperative definition doesn't necessarily
        imply that engineering and marketing have completely overlapping
        responsibilities and authorities in product definition. Some companies
        give engineering the final word, while others give marketing the lead
        role. When the marketing team is strong, the marketing-driven approach
        usually works the best. In either situation, cooperative behavior
        produces the best results.</p><p>During the initial product definition process, short daily
        discussions between marketing and engineering encourage more rapid
        closure on choosing the best options to pursue. The daily discussion
        becomes a <span class="emphasis"><em>continuous conversation</em></span> that allows
        iterative refinement of the requirements and ultimately the
        definition. The teams can analyze the feature costs, timeline, and
        definition in stages—be they quick overviews, intermediate level
        reviews, or fuller definition reviews. At each stage, the teams work
        together to select and eliminate options through thoughtful analysis
        and data collection.</p><p>Ideally, the marketing/engineering evaluation works as follows:
        First, engineering works <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0247"/>with marketing to define preliminary <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0248"/>quick estimates of product size and scope. Next, both
        teams agree on how to pare down the list. Remaining items are analyzed
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0249"/>with more detail. Then this <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0250"/>process is repeated until both teams agree on a final
        set of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0251"/>product definitions, costs, and timelines. <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#sifting_through_initial_product_ideas_to" title="Figure 5-1. Sifting through initial product ideas to produce final choices">Figure 5-1</a> illustrates this
        filtering process.</p><div class="figure"><a id="sifting_through_initial_product_ideas_to"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e3568"/><img alt="Sifting through initial product ideas to produce final choices" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266069.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5-1. Sifting through initial product ideas to produce final
          choices</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>If a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0252"/>trusting relationship does not exist between the
        marketing and engineering teams, the steps in the process will
        degrade. For example, if marketing treats preliminary quick estimates
        from engineering as full commitments and pressures engineering to meet
        those commitments, engineers will probably stop providing quick
        estimates. Engineers create quick estimates based on limited
        information; these estimates are unsuitable for accurate budgeting and
        scheduling, but fine for establishing ballpark costs so that the
        initial direction can be set. Providing quick estimates as cost ranges
        emphasizes the uncertainty involved, but the analysis is insufficient
        to use in creating an accurate project schedule.</p><p>Once mistrust has soured the engineering and marketing
        relationship, the very expensive process shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#wasteful_selection_process" title="Figure 5-2. Wasteful selection process">Figure 5-2</a> ensues. In this case, both
        teams treat conversations as mini-contracts, eliminating speculative
        discussions. All feature and project ideas require extensive
        evaluation before engineering will provide any type of estimate, and
        engineering devotes considerable time to precise, in-depth estimates.
        Marketing has to invest substantially more time in fully defining
        every idea before presenting them to engineering. Worst of all,
        engineering must create detailed estimates for
        <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the options before presenting them to
        marketing.</p><div class="figure"><a id="wasteful_selection_process"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e3589"/><img alt="Wasteful selection process" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266071.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5-2. Wasteful selection process</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Why do so many companies choose such a wasteful approach to
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0253"/>product definition? Past bad behavior usually drives
        defensive <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0254"/>relationships. If in the past, engineering produced
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0255"/>quick estimates based on initial ideas, and then
        marketing insisted that these numbers be treated as final, engineering
        has little incentive to provide quick estimates in the
        future.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0256"/></p><p>When operating under a successful approach, however, engineering
        and marketing can collect more information and refine definitions for
        the ideas that will be implemented. <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#clarity_of_definition_versus_amount_of_d" title="Figure 5-3. Clarity of definition versus amount of detail">Figure 5-3</a> illustrates the
        pyramid of information associated <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0257"/>with refining a definition. Each layer reflects more
        product information.</p><p>A refined definition starts at the <span class="emphasis"><em>top
        level</em></span> and focuses on the customer's needs. As the
        definition process continues, marketing and engineering produce a more
        detailed description of the product: detailed requirements, high-level
        implementation descriptions, detailed concept models and prototypes,
        and then the functional specifications. Then engineering considers the
        product architecture, examines the requirements of the product's
        construction, and prepares a detailed description of its features and
        user interface. Finally, engineering and marketing together flesh out
        the complete definition of the product offering.</p><div class="figure"><a id="clarity_of_definition_versus_amount_of_d"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e3638"/><img alt="Clarity of definition versus amount of detail" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266073.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5-3. Clarity of definition versus amount of detail</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0258"/>process is challenging because the teams must make
        product decisions based on incomplete information. Decisions involve
        trade-offs between features, timelines, resources, and implementation
        approaches. Making sound <span class="emphasis"><em>initial</em></span> decisions
        requires not waiting until development is building the product before
        thoroughly analyzing what needs to be built. If questions about the
        technical feasibility of specific functions of features arise, a
        senior engineer should be asked to create simple prototypes for these
        technical areas before building the software. Prototypes are discussed
        in detail later on.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="product_definition_contents"/>Product Definition Contents</h1></div></div></div><p>As you strive to define your product, create a document that
        outlines product <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0259"/>specifications, and continue to update this document as
        you work with marketing staff and customers to refine the focus.
        Sketches and notes might be useful for initial discussions, but they
        will not provide sufficient background data for the future as you are
        required to make revisions and improvements.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0260"/></p><p>Small companies benefit from short, concise definitions rather
        than formal specifications. Instead of creating a complex
        specification that's time consuming to create and maintain and
        difficult to read, create your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0261"/>product definition with readability and idea sharing in
        mind.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e3678"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e3683"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e3688"/></p><p>Simple definitions improve development agility. Follow these
        general guidelines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Keep the documentation short and readable. Focus on
            high-level definitions of functionality, and do not elaborate on
            detailed specifics. Simplicity in definition can sometimes require
            negotiating with marketing and other teams about the nature of the
            document. Too much complexity will render the document less
            readable as reviewers fill in every detail.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Avoid adding implementation details as part of the
            definition, because they do not provide clarity to the solution
            and can limit your options later when you're considering how to
            supply what the customer needs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Keep the document readable in layout. Avoid a formalized
            template that requires labeling and numbering every
            statement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0262"/>pictures as focal points for written definitions.
            Reviewers might have a hard time visualizing the top-level system
            definition if only text is provided. A diagram can be used to
            clarify difficult concepts and acts as a catalyst for ongoing
            discussions of the system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Layer the discussion by starting with overview information
            before explaining the lower-level details. Overview information
            provides context for the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0263"/>product including audience, most important
            objectives, and problems solved. Engineers often describe systems
            linearly from start to finish. For nontechnical or even unfamiliar
            readers, an overview provides context that makes the lower-level
            details much easier to understand.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create user interface <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0264"/>prototypes as part of the product definition, and
            use them selectively in your requirements document. Pages and
            pages of screen captures don't add context or value.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Consider employing use cases to define sections of the
            product. A <span class="emphasis"><em>use case</em></span> describes all the steps a
            user would take to obtain a specific goal using the product. Use
            cases supplement and clarify the product definition but should not
            be considered full <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0265"/>specifications in themselves.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make requirements testable and nonambiguous. Avoid words
            that require interpretation or those that QA cannot measure.
            Requirements outside of functional requirements fall into this
            category. For example, don't say your product requires
            <span class="emphasis"><em>rapid response, high speed</em></span>, and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>support for large data sets</em></span>. It's better to
            use definitions such as <span class="emphasis"><em>2 seconds or less response on
            all screens using our standard hardware</em></span>,
            <span class="emphasis"><em>translation data rate minimum of 1.5MB per
            second</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>support for data sets of 500
            million user records</em></span>. Creating nonambiguous and
            testable requirements doesn't mean that the specification has to
            be formal and extensive. Just ensure that what you do specify is
            clear and worthwhile. "Good quality" doesn't cut it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use a requirements definition template to organize your
            requirements document. A template organizes the information in a
            consistent way from document to document, which provides an easy
            context for people in your company who read it. A good template
            can help you avoid omitting important topics if it properly lists
            all of the types of information needed. The best templates are
            accepted by the team as being practical and useful—not just a form
            to fill out to keep management happy.</p></li></ul></div><p>A number of good templates for requirement definitions exist.
        Review multiple templates before selecting one that suits your needs.

        should replace all the words in italics with the information required
        for your project.)<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0266"/></p><p>Prioritize requirements as you define the product. If you
        discuss priorities with marketing early on, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0267"/>product definitions will be smoother and you can avoid
        having to check back with marketing to clarify issues. Establish
        priorities for <span class="emphasis"><em>agile</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>iterative</em></span> processes, as they allow you to make
        trade-offs in the design. They also assist in the project planning,
        allowing you to organize efforts to focus on highest priority items
        earlier. Completing the highest priority features first will minimize
        problems that occur when plans are changed or schedules are shortened
        as business needs change.</p></div>

        provides a high-level view of the customer's requirements. This
        definition does not include enough detail for engineering to build the
        product, however; several additional layers of information are
        required to help you build a solution. Engineering must create working
        definitions of the product's <span class="emphasis"><em>user interface (UI)</em></span>,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>application programming interface (API)</em></span>, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>business logic</em></span>. The most expensive way to create
        such working-level definitions is for individual engineers to decide
        how to build the software, build it, and then present the results to
        marketing. Invariably, this approach leads to several expensive cycles
        of rework. A better way is to spend the required time up front
        defining the product in key areas and working with marketing until
        reaching agreement on a product definition.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0272"/></p><p>After the product has been sufficiently defined, presenting a
        series of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0273"/>prototypes to marketing and the customer along with new
        ideas will allow for several quick review cycles and a better final
        product.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="prototypes_in_general"/>Prototypes in General</h2></div></div></div><p>Engineers want to deliver software that solves the customer's
          problems, rather than simply delivering code that's been built based
          on a marketing requirements document. Generally, marketing and the
          customer are unable to provide a detailed definition of the best
          solution. They need to experience a <span class="emphasis"><em>prototype</em></span>
          to appreciate and understand what they like and dislike about
          various choices. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0274"/>Prototypes allow customers to "touch and feel" the
          product to help them make informed decisions. Without a prototype,
          realizing a clear product definition can require a long process of
          trial and error.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0275"/>Prototypes are helpful in obtaining information from
          the customer and marketing staff. The process only begins with the
          first prototype developers create—the development team will collect
          feedback and improve the prototype until marketing and ultimately
          the customer are pleased with the results. The feedback and
          prototype improvement cycle enables you to define the product
          effectively. It also protects you from time wasted traveling too far
          down the wrong development paths.</p><p>You can use a number of techniques to create prototypes. Paper
          sketches of the interfaces can be presented in different sequences
          to describe concepts to customers. Better yet, you can use
          software-based tools to create interfaces that resemble the final
          software. Many such tools are designed specifically to assist in
          creating rapid prototypes, allowing you to define a prototype that
          is both accessible and easy to distribute to others for their
          feedback. Some example systems are discussed in this chapter.</p><p>After you have created a prototype, review it with marketing
          and the customer, as well as with other teams. Talk with QA,
          customer service, and operations; they can offer new insights into
          how the product definition prototype affects other parts of the
          company and help you define ways to improve the product.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="quick_and_nimble_approaches"/>Quick and Nimble Approaches</h2></div></div></div><p>Limit the time spent creating prototypes to make it easier to
          consider alternative approaches and changes later on. In addition,
          avoid creating expensive prototypes, because the high costs can make
          developers less likely to investigate alternative approaches.</p><p>Discourage engineers from spending more than a few days
          creating each <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0276"/>prototype. A developer who has spent many days
          creating a prototype might be reluctant to make significant changes
          to it. The developer might also be tempted to turn the prototype
          into the product itself, which is a bad idea.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0277"/>Prototypes are usually discarded after you've learned
          what you need to know from them—another reason to limit resources
          spent on prototyping. Discarding <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0278"/>prototypes will prevent you from being saddled with
          the flaws inherent in a quick construction. For this reason, you
          should discourage or prohibit the reuse of prototype code in
          production code. If the prototype tests the technical feasibility of
          a concept and the engineer must write it in the language of the

          means, don't wait to improve the UI until after you have shipped the
          product! It will be too late to make significant changes without
          incurring significant costs and creating confusion for your
          customers. Many engineering teams without UI experience design an
          interface based on ease of implementation rather than ease of use.
          As the interface is the primary customer contact point, a poor
          interface can make customers unhappy with a product, even if the
          rest of the product is superior.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0289"/></p><p>If the product requires a particularly challenging UI design,
          hire a human factors engineer or usability engineer to help refine
          the interface. These experts understand how people work with
          software and can help you make the product easy to use. Their input
          can greatly improve the product and your customer's satisfaction
          with it and with your company.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0290"/>Human factors engineers and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0291"/>usability engineers are not usually employees at small
          firms, because they typically don't have enough work to justify
          full-time employment. Hiring a usability consultant can be expensive
          but is a worthwhile expenditure, and good usability engineers are
          worth their fees. The consulting engineer can quickly devise great
          solutions for new UIs and evaluate existing UIs.</p></div></div>

        engineering and marketing can help both teams jointly own the product
        definition, roadmap, and delivery. In fact, they
        <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> jointly own these things. A good
        relationship <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0292"/>with marketing will help you do a better job as
        development manager, improve the quality of your company's product
        through better definitions, and make it easier to respond to problems
        that occur during the project tenure.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0293"/></p><p>Reach out to marketing and build a trusting relationship at the
        start. Behave in a manner that encourages mutual trust and cooperation
        between the marketing and development teams. Help build the
        partnership by communicating regularly—daily, or at least several
        times a week—to build trust and increase your understanding of each
        other's ways of working and particular needs. Your team's relationship
        with marketing will be defined by how you handle failures, as much as
        how you handle successes. Partnership means joint success and failure.
        When the partnership produces success, you can share the credit. When
        part of the project fails, you can jointly accept the failure rather
        than trying to minimize your roles or blame the other party.</p><p>To be a strong partner with marketing, you should understand
        basic marketing concepts, including how product requirements are
        defined by marketing, how items are packaged, and how various types of
        customers can be served by a single product offering. Spend time
        learning about the science and art of marketing by consulting books or
        signing up for an introductory marketing course.</p><p>Although <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0294"/>marketing and engineering are the major sources of
        product definitions in many small companies, other teams also
        contribute to the product definition. Make sure that you build
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0295"/>relationships with operations, sales, quality assurance,
        and finance. A great relationship with marketing without support from
        other teams can lead to lack of company support for any plan.
        Understanding the concerns of and seeking input from other groups will
        strengthen your team's relationships throughout the company.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e4062"/></p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="avoid_poor_relationships"/>Avoid Poor Relationships</h2></div></div></div><p>You might be surprised to hear this, but the relationship
          between <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0296"/>marketing and engineering teams can be adversarial at
          times. A natural push-pull tension exists between marketing and
          engineering over product definition, feature set, cost, and delivery
          schedules. Marketing teams commonly complain that engineering
          delivered the product late and that it is missing features.
          Development teams complain that marketing folks keep changing their
          minds about what features to include or that they have made feature
          promises to a client <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0297"/>without first discussing them <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0298"/>with engineering.</p><p>Finger-pointing and defensive behaviors will quickly erode a
          work environment and slow down product development, because each
          group will demand a more complete analysis before responding to the
          other group's concerns, as discussed earlier in the chapter.
          Marketing and engineering teams that cannot work together
          cooperatively can make the product development process a nightmare.
          Game playing, such as "we must have one more feature, but you cannot
          change the schedule," can frustrate both teams, ruin the product
          definition process, and wreck morale.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="politics_versus_productivity"/><p class="title"><b>POLITICS VERSUS PRODUCTIVITY</b></p><p>The marketing person I worked with had a long laundry list
            of things he wanted. To help with initial paring, I did a quick
            order-of-magnitude sizing on all of the items based on sketchy
            definitions. We agreed that we would revisit those of interest and
            figure out the details and then estimate them. Doing a detailed

            definition time.</p><p>The marketing VP stepped in and selected the items he
            wanted. He insisted that quick estimates were the final estimates
            and that he would base the final plans on them. Because of the
            politics of the company, saying no was not an option. This VP's
            actions changed the dynamic of engineering-marketing cooperation
            in the wrong way. Engineering would not do quick estimates for
            marketing going forward.</p><p>—Engineering manager</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keep_marketing_and_engineering_teams_tog"/>Keep Marketing and Engineering Teams Together</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0299"/>Marketing and engineering teams should be located in
          the same facility to encourage cooperation and produce the best
          product definitions. When team offices are in the same vicinity, the
          teams can communicate better and build trust. The opportunities for
          creating a joint product definition are improved when the teams can
          easily talk and share their ideas on a regular basis.</p><p>Conversely, splitting marketing and engineering into two
          separate facilities can make it difficult to establish the close
          working relationship that good product definitions require.
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0300"/>With remote teams, people miss opportunities for
          casual communication that helps build trusting <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0301"/>relationships. They communicate more often through

          <span class="emphasis"><em>balance</em></span>. You should be able to say no to a
          marketing request without that decision being considered a rebuff.
          Disagreements needn't result in the marketing manager asking the CEO
          to force a decision upon you. If you regularly find yourself in
          situations in which you cannot say <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>, perhaps
          you should say <span class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span> to a new position.</p><p>Before saying <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> to a marketing request,

          offer options to marketing's requests, you can improve the
          collaborative relationship and work together to seek the best
          solutions.</p><p>When looking for positive alternatives, consider these
          options: fit in a new feature or new product later in the product
          roadmap, swap a planned set of functionality with the new request,
          or delay a planned release to add the new functionality. In any
          case, be sure that you can support the alternative solutions that

          change has disrupted your company's next few releases and
          potentially its future revenue.</p><p>If an engineer adds unapproved features to product code, pull
          her aside and coach her about her action's impact on the product and
          the company. When talking to the responsible engineer, remember that
          your goal is not to stifle innovation, but to encourage team
          discussion of key features before they are implemented.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="best_intentions"/><p class="title"><b>BEST INTENTIONS</b></p><p>A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0321"/>customer service employee made a feature request
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0322"/>of an engineer working on one piece of our system.
            The engineer thought it was a neat change, so he implemented it
            without telling anyone else. When the release came out, the
            customer service person told key customers about the feature and
            the customers started using it. A few customers really liked the
            feature and started using it extensively. Customers built up their
            own data files tied into this feature.</p><p>However, two key customers quickly found out that the
            product did not support the feature in all areas. This was a huge
            problem for them and they became vocal about it. As large
            customers were pushing for the change, they forced us to change
            our release strategy to support this change. Full feature support
            was not cheap; we had to implement it as a quickly planned
            release. This left other customers unhappy and affected our
            ability to support other critical new features. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0323"/>unplanned feature really upset the marketing team.
            Going forward, I instituted clear rules for engineers not to add
            in any features without approval.</p><p>—Product development manager</p></div></div></div>

        Defining the future <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0327"/>of a product requires a clear understanding of the
        product <span class="emphasis"><em>as it stands</em></span>. Because you might not have
        been involved at the beginning of the product definition process, you
        can step back and take a snapshot view of the product and its features
        to illuminate any problem areas. Understanding an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0328"/>existing product also requires that you check "under the
        hood" for code and construction particulars.</p><p>The customer scrutinizes the product based on its functions and
        ability to meet requirements. However, under the hood, each product
        can consist of software packaging (the wrapper around the product
        executables and libraries that make it easy to unpack, install, set
        up, and use), multiple code executables, data files, and a database.
        Small companies often do not properly maintain documentation of a
        product's "internal engine."</p><p>Unraveling which software modules are included in which external
        product can be difficult if many executables have been built over time
        and staff changes have occurred during the process. In a few cases,
        engineers create hierarchies of code components as part of the build
        or packaging, which makes the product composition difficult to sort
        out.</p><p>For software services with many different components, tracking
        down which pieces the customer uses and which the administrator uses
        can be a complex task. Sometimes components are included in the
        software build but are no longer in use. If the product has a long
        history in the market, you should talk with multiple engineers, QA,
        and operations staff to determine the product composition.</p><p>In some cases, your company might have heavily customized a
        product to accommodate particular customers' needs. If the development
        team did not record these customization details, determining exactly
        which parts of a product are important to which customers becomes a
        huge problem when it comes time to maintain or update the
        product.</p><p>Three case histories illustrate the problems with unclear
        product definitions mapping to code. In all cases, much work was
        required to reach agreement on defining the product and then
        documenting the results.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0329"/></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>Case 1: Many Compatible

              <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0331"/>modules that had been developed over a decade. The
              operations team had built these modules into a hierarchy; the
              result was a few dozen different product offerings with
              overlapping modules. Seven levels of grouping hierarchy were
              required to build some products. The hierarchy and grouping had
              built up until the people building and packaging the products
              were unclear about their actual contents.</p><p>Unraveling this problem required getting the marketing
              descriptions, licensing descriptions, and the homemade packaging
              file. The development manager wrote a program to map components
              to products and identify overlaps and licensing issues. As it
              turned out, many conflicts existed, including license
              duplications. Going through the process simplified
              reorganization of the licensing and packaging and identified
              extra software that was being included unintentionally in some
              packages. This resulted in lost revenue for the company, as a
              key product was being given away instead of being sold with
              every shipment.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0332"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>Case 2: Too Much Custom

              offerings. Unfortunately, no one had documented them along with
              pricing and construction information. Management had no clear
              vision of the various offerings, and sales treated the offerings
              as full custom efforts and made no effort to address the process
              and cost issues associated with this approach.</p><p>Marketing, engineering, and management resolved this issue
              by defining each product's content, construction, and pricing,
              and then publishing the results. They produced a standard
              pricing spreadsheet that they required everyone to use. This
              lowered the need for expensive new development with each new
              customer. It also streamlined the process of bringing in new
              customers.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0333"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>Case 3: Undocumented System with

              software through an API. The system included multiple modules
              that talked to each other and resided on different services. To
              complicate the situation, the company had gone through several
              different versions of the system, and legacy code still resided
              in the production code. Various employees offered different
              answers about the product's composition because few understood
              the big picture that included all the elements.</p><p>After talking to operations and engineering staff, the
              engineering manager wrote a high-level summary showing the
              different modules and how they corresponded to the system. The
              manager created a detailed system diagram that showed the
              various servers and which modules were deployed to each one,
              including those used only by operations. The team used this
              summary for future testing and planning, which allowed for
              identification of modules to be removed from the system,
              lowering maintenance costs.</p></dd></dl></div><p>In all these cases, the core problem was that although
        construction of the product changed over time, nobody in the company
        drove the choices or documented them. Development management needs to
        work actively with marketing to define product composition and keep
        internal documents up to date. Product composition issues might appear
        to be unlikely problems, but they do occur regularly in small
        companies.</p></div>

      your company's software product into your customers' hands. In fact, the
      method you use to deliver the code is not as important as the release
      process you use to <span class="emphasis"><em>prepare</em></span> it for delivery. A weak
      release process can not only add delays and unpredictability to your
      product delivery, but it can result in a low-quality product and a
      tarnished company image.</p><p>Small companies often have weak release processes because
      management doesn't realize the value of a well-defined plan. A company's
      release process isn't considered as important as product development and
      sales. Although the release process doesn't affect a company's
      <span class="emphasis"><em>short-term</em></span> bottom line, ignoring its importance can
      lead to ill-advised approaches, such as emailing the product's
      executables to customers from a developer's computer.</p><p>An unplanned, "ad hoc" release will negatively affect the
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0334"/>company's <span class="emphasis"><em>long-term</em></span> bottom line. The
      problems created by past ad hoc releases become most apparent as your
      company starts to grow. Ad hoc releases are <span class="emphasis"><em>not
      repeatable</em></span>, they are <span class="emphasis"><em>impossible to
      support</em></span> long term, and they are <span class="emphasis"><em>error
      prone</em></span>. A release that is not repeatable will lead to problems
      if and when you need to re-create and repair earlier release code, which
      typically occurs in supporting a customer using an older version of your
      product. Second, because of the casual nature of the delivery, ad hoc
      releases are difficult if not impossible to support. In some cases,
      engineers will ship a code copy built on a local machine rather than a
      copy from the source control repository, making it difficult to know
      which content ended up in which customer's hands. Third, ad hoc releases
      are error-prone because they do not go through the proper testing,
      documenting, and labeling necessary to ensure a high-quality,
      supportable release.</p><p>Other problems associated with poor <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0335"/>release planning can create nightmares for small
      companies: Poor release naming can lead to mistakes in the content;
      releases can ship without plans for resolving customer problems; and
      customers can become upset because a delivered release was unexpected
      and they were uninformed of its contents.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="release_planning"/>Release Planning</h1></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the most underrated aspect of the release planning
        process is its ability to reinforce or undermine your company's values
        and image. Over time, your releases should match your company's
        long-term vision, whether from the standpoint of strategy or corporate
        image. For example, if you want your company and its products to be
        known for their high quality, the release plans should support
        high-quality releases. If you want to be known for rapid innovation,
        releases should be innovative and frequent.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0336"/></p><p>Release planning also involves thinking ahead about the type and
        nature of releases. For example, you might decide that engineering
        will not plan patch releases in advance because releases will be
        designed to fix only serious problems. However, engineering can plan
        for such releases' quick delivery. Mapping out in advance each type of
        release will better prepare your team for the inevitable changes and
        surprises that will occur. Planning a release strategy is much better
        than letting releases just <span class="emphasis"><em>happen</em></span>.</p><p>Consider the release timeline and associated early release
        strategy as part of release <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0337"/>planning. Then, with guidelines in place, you can
        establish release criteria and processes to create more efficient and
        higher-quality releases.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release_timeline"/>Release Timeline</h2></div></div></div><p>Your company's <span class="emphasis"><em>release timeline</em></span> is the
          most influential part of matching your release strategy to your
          company's overall strategy and product vision. A clear timeline
          allows for more realistic release plans and lets your company
          establish appropriate <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0338"/>customer expectations. On the other hand, not planning
          release timelines means that your results will be variable and
          unpredictable, and they probably won't convey the image you want
          your customers to see. Develop a timeline with marketing and review
          it with the executive team to generate input and support to
          implement it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-3"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This section is intended as an introduction to
            release timelines and timeline planning. Release planning requires
            an understanding of several topics covered in Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING">Chapter 12</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. STARTING A PROJECT">Chapter 13</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. PROJECT EXECUTION AND TRACKING">Chapter 14</a>, and <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. DESIGNING A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS">Chapter 15</a></em></span>.</p></div><p>Your strategy for a release timeline will also define the
          types of releases you will create and guidelines for when they
          occur. When defining a release timeline, consider your customers'
          needs and your company's desired market image. For example, if your
          product is complex and customers want to upgrade versions only once
          a year, plan for major releases to occur yearly and optional minor
          releases to occur intermittently. At the other extreme, some product
          markets are highly competitive and change rapidly; quarterly or more
          frequent releases might be required.</p><p>Consider the practical minimum time for a release. For
          example, if a release requires four weeks of testing and a two-week
          approval cycle, more than six weeks must pass between releases.
          Alternatively, if you are building a web-hosted product that can be
          tested in a single day, fewer timeline restrictions apply to your
          strategy.</p><p>In addition, if your main product can be customized for
          individual customers, you could release customized versions more
          often than general releases. Another consideration is how far in
          advance your customers need to be informed of imminent releases. If,
          for example, customers require four weeks' notice before new
          software is released and available, having less than a four-week
          development cycle does not make sense.</p><p>After you have created an overall release strategy, consider
          your short-term plans for the next 6 to 12 months. During this
          period, you can map out your expectations for the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Number of major releases</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Number of minor releases</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Customized releases</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Expectations for patches</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Expectations of work not included on the normal release
              cycle</p></li></ul></div><p>With these expectations in mind, you can plan and number the
          near-term releases. When you are assigning approximate timelines,
          allow gaps in your schedule to accommodate unexpected issues and
          patch creation. If you do not include time for surprises, you will
          be habitually late in releasing your product. Make sure you have an
          up-front agreement with marketing and other teams about the
          flexibility of timelines. If product release dates require rigid,
          unmovable dates, increase the buffer time to allow for unknown
          events and opportunities that will occur.</p><p>As you plan the next few releases, consider both start and end
          dates for each release cycle. Releases that consider only end dates
          can suffer from overlapping resource use if separate parallel
          release efforts are planned. By mapping out start and end times for
          each planned release, you can determine where and when resource
          conflicts might occur.</p><p>Finally, for your next major release, consider the milestones
          for that release before finalizing your plan. If you plan a release
          date without considering testing, approvals, customer checkpoints,
          alpha releases, or beta releases, you will have to backpedal
          later.</p><p>Next, we'll look into the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0339"/>early release strategy and its impact on release
          timelines in more detail.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="early_release_strategy"/>Early Release Strategy</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>early release strategy</em></span> is an approach

                feedback on product features and concepts. In addition,
                because the code has undergone more testing, customers can
                often use it for practical applications, which can help them
                provide early feedback about implementation problems or

          Review all three release approaches with marketing, and decide
          together which risks are appropriate for your company. All
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0344"/>early releases impose costs on marketing and
          development that will slow delivery of the full releases.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="alpha_release"/>Alpha Release</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0345"/>Alpha releases allow customers to offer useful
            feedback <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0346"/>early in the production cycle while it is still
            relatively easy to make changes to the product code. In addition,
            customers can help you find problems that can be corrected well
            before QA has invested considerable time reviewing the
            code.</p><p>Two notable problems occur with alpha releases, however:
            First, customers often have inappropriately high expectations for
            the release. When reality does not meet those expectations, the
            customer can get a negative impression of the software and might
            not want to use the production version. To minimize such problems,
            you should properly describe the state of the alpha code to the
            customer along with the alpha release. Also consider adding a
            startup screen that highlights the fact that this is an alpha
            release with alpha code. This can help minimize problems that
            might occur, for example, if a primary customer contact passes the
            code to others in his company without passing them the
            disclaimers.</p><p>A second problem occurs when customers use alpha releases in
            a production environment. Sometimes impatient customers will run
            their production data against alpha or beta code despite their
            having agreed not to do so. Then, when a serious problem occurs
            with alpha or beta code, these customers will argue for immediate
            repair and data recovery. The common justification? "The new
            feature was so critical that we needed it immediately." You can
            avoid this problem by disabling or limiting the capabilities of
            the alpha release to prevent a customer from using it in a
            production setting. Unfortunately, this might not always be
            possible, as some alpha testing requires that the product be used
            on large data sets.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-4"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If a customer has a history of misusing alpha
              releases, consider giving them only beta or limited releases or
              not using that customer for an early release
              program</em></span>.</p></div><p>Overall, alpha releases are useful, but consider the risks
            and work to minimize them before shipping alpha code.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="beta_release"/>Beta Release</h3></div></div></div><p>The goals of a beta release are to get advance notice of
            problems when the customer uses the code and to get feedback on
            new features. However, making changes to the code in response to
            beta feedback can require production schedule changes, because
            beta code versions are typically sent to customers near the end of
            the release cycle—before QA has completed testing.</p><p>A beta release faces the same risks faced by an alpha
            release, but the quality risk is lower than an alpha because QA
            has completed more product testing. In a beta release, that extra
            QA testing lessens the chance of a code malfunction disillusioning
            the customer. It also provides a more appropriate opportunity to
            test the code in actual customer situations to determine whether
            customers can uncover any prerelease problems. Make sure your
            customers have a clear understanding about the valid uses and
            risks associated with beta code. To improve your beta results,
            engineering should let the customer know the true status of the
            code and set the proper expectations.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="limited_release"/>Limited Release</h3></div></div></div><p>A limited release differs from alpha and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0347"/>beta releases because the code is ready to ship. The
            goal of a limited release is to reduce the risk of widespread
            visibility in the event of problems. As a result, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0348"/>limited releases are sent only to
            <span class="emphasis"><em>friendly</em></span> customers. This approach works well
            if errors or problems found post-release are costly to repair,
            especially if customer safety or data is at risk.</p><p>Because problems in the code haven't reached all your
            customers and the code is production-ready, the limited release is
            a risk-reduction technique. If someone discovers a large problem,
            a few users will be unhappy, but not your entire user base. The
            situation is better than a full release because the team can focus
            directly on fewer customers. If a customer finds problems, the
            release team can create a patch as quickly as possible.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage of this approach is that only a few
            customers review the code; most customers get the new final
            software a few weeks later. Limited <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0349"/>releases also add to the overall cost of software
            development, as the development team does not fully focus on the
            next release during a limited release.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e4815"/></p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="planning_product_end_of_life"/>Planning Product End of Life</h2></div></div></div><p>Small companies can benefit from creating an
          <span class="emphasis"><em>end-of-life</em></span> process—that is, a process for
          retiring products. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0350"/>Planning for this stage might seem odd at first. Most
          software managers in small companies think, "We just created our
          product line, so why would we think about killing parts of it?
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0351"/>End of life is something that large companies worry
          about. Not us." However, end of life issues can arrive
          <span class="emphasis"><em>earlier</em></span> in small companies that tend to attempt
          several different solutions to a problem. And every software product
          has an ongoing cost that small companies can least afford. The real
          benefits of a good product retirement plan are improved customer
          satisfaction, reduced internal costs of supporting your customer
          base, and improved profits if your company can remove unprofitable
          products from production.</p><p>When and how do you actually realize those benefits? When
          you're planning for your next release, review your products and
          consider candidates for end of life. From an engineering
          perspective, a good candidate could be software whose platform is
          old or obsolete. <span class="emphasis"><em>Platform</em></span> in this case includes
          the hardware, operating system, or even a third-party software
          package. From a marketing point of view, the key factors for end of
          life are customer use and revenue. Products with small customer
          followings, significant technology issues, and little future
          potential might be good candidates for retirement.</p><p>It's true that retiring a product can annoy some customers who
          still use it, but sometimes the cost of supporting that product
          exceeds the value to the customer and the company. You and your team
          are in the best position to identify the costs associated with
          ongoing builds, testing, support, and maintenance. You're also best
          equipped to identify technical failings, which raises another
          important point: Sometimes development needs to take the initiative
          and raise the issue of retiring products. However, the engineers'
          assessment must recognize and balance technical dislikes and costs
          to the business of product end of life.</p><p>When you reach internal consensus to retire a product, create
          an end-of-life process. This process keeps you from missing
          important steps that can cause problems for your customers, cost
          your company money, cost your customers money, and hurt your image
          with your customers. Major steps to consider for this process

        required to release the product once development has built and tested
        it. It is a single step in the overall product development process. To
        develop a release process, first consider the process goals. Internal
        releases need to be named clearly and consistently. The process needs
        to support customer communication about critical issues such as timing
        and features. It also needs to be repeatable, must minimize release
        errors, and must have a review and improvement mechanism in
        place.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0361"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0362"/></p><p>Let's look first at criteria for release, followed by advice for
        defining a release process.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release_criteria"/>Release Criteria</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Release criteria</em></span> define what a successful
          release should look like. It answers the age-old question, "Are we
          there yet?" Knowing in advance what you expect in a release—when it
          comes to features, timing, process steps, and quality—will allow you
          to guide your team toward success while monitoring progress. If the
          criteria have gained consensus within your team, it can also
          minimize pressure to release the product prematurely.</p><p>The problem that often arises without release criteria is
          "tunnel vision." Without a definition of what a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>completed</em></span> release means, engineering will focus
          only on delivery date. The release will consist of what is available
          near the delivery date, with less attention paid to functionality
          and quality.</p><p>Release criteria can and should be unique to each company. For
          example, a company whose product and image require high quality will
          produce release criteria of high minimum quality standards; a
          company that emphasizes customer satisfaction should produce release
          criteria that require proper customer communication prior to the
          release; and a company that emphasizes ease of use should produce
          release criteria that require specific approval ratings from
          customers before the product is shipped.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e5005"/></p><p>It is wise to work with marketing and consider your business
          needs <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0363"/>before setting the release standards. Ensuring that
          you have corporate buy-in on those standards will help the team make
          good decisions when the pressure is on near release time.</p><p>To set <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0364"/>release criteria, consider the following
          questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What is the minimum quality acceptable for a

          overdefine the minimum standards for a release. Sure, management
          wants the best in all categories, but from a practical standpoint,
          that cannot happen. It is better to emphasize one aspect of the
          release criteria with higher standards and set more generous lower

          flexibility in decisions.</p><p>With <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0367"/>release criteria in place, defining a release

          should include development teams as well as other teams involved in
          the release cycle: marketing, customer service, and QA, for example.
          Informal one-hour sessions will probably be sufficient. The session
          should cover these points:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0375"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What went well in the release that we should continue

          few post-release review meetings of one to two hours each can be
          helpful. These meetings require much preparation, and everyone
          should be aware of that. Create an agenda for each meeting, and ask
          all participants to come prepared with their thoughts on the agenda.
          Also, arrange for a conference room with a whiteboard and mark out
          general categories of problems that are relevant to the release to
          help people generate ideas during the meeting.</p><p>To get ideas flowing at the start of the meeting, pass out
          large sticky notes and ask participants to write down issues or
          problems, one issue per note. Each person can post one problem at a
          time and say a few lines about it. This is not the time for detailed
          discussion, however—it's about collecting thoughts and ideas. Move
          around the room from person to person to assure that everyone, even
          quiet team members, can have his or her say.</p><p>Depending on the length of the session, attendees can
          prioritize the issues and problems at the end of the meeting or in a
          second meeting. After you've grouped similar issues together, ask
          the team to set priorities <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0376"/>for important outstanding issues. At the end of the
          prioritization, write up the results to highlight the issues and
          priorities and send this to everyone who participated. Then ask the
          group to be prepared to talk about potential solutions for the
          highest ranking problems at the next meeting. At a follow-up
          meeting, each person can present solutions to the highest priority
          issues, using sticky notes to summarize ideas in a single sentence.
          Avoid lengthy discussions on single topics until everyone has had a
          chance to present his or her ideas. In-depth discussions can occur
          later.</p><p>After the solutions meeting, write up the top problems and
          their solutions. Then ask team members to review the results and
          provide additional ideas. Select the problems you can address, and
          let the team know the plan for making improvements. Any problems you
          cannot address directly can be discussed with the executive team.
          Larger, expensive solutions might require that you write a business
          case to justify the costs and efforts. Large or small, make a good
          faith effort to address the important issues, and inform people
          about which issues you aren't addressing and why.</p><p>Be thorough and follow through with the ideas and solutions
          generated in <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0377"/>post-release reviews. Conducting an abbreviated review
          with no follow-up can be worse than having no review at all, because
          a lack of attention to issues can result in staff cynicism and a
          belief that the problems will never improve.</p></div></div>

        inconsequential, but small companies often run into difficulties by
        not properly identifying their releases. Poorly identified releases
        lead to wasted time and effort due to the following possible
        consequences:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0378"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Engineers add code to the wrong release.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Marketing sends the wrong information to customers about

          chapter provides an extended discussion of product numbering issues
          and practices</em></span>.</p></div><p>While large firms usually apply a well-defined <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0379"/>version numbering sequence, small firms often use
        inconsistent version identifiers. Frequently, the first identifiers
        are release names based on feature sets. Examples would be the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Database Throughput Release</em></span> or the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Customer ABC Support Release</em></span>.</p><p>As your company gets a few releases under its belt, the need to
        identify each release in a unique and informative way increases for
        several reasons. Customers reporting issues need a clear version
        number to reference when reporting problems. Development needs to know
        which of the upcoming releases will get which critical feature. And
        both engineering and QA need to know which errors were found in which
        version to resolve each issue properly.</p><p>Clear release identifiers also make defect-repair planning
        easier, since you can assign individual defects to specific future
        releases. They also aid the documentation team in pulling together
        release notes. All of these reasons should push you toward an
        effective release naming method as early as possible in your company's
        growth.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="three-number_release_ids"/>Three-Number Release IDs</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a lot of psychology in how people react to numbers—a
          version number of 17 might imply that the developers never got it
          right and had to keep putting out major releases, while when a major
          new version comes out, the company renames it something new, like
          <span class="emphasis"><em>version 2.0</em></span>. Most software goes through quick
          cycles of initial growth and sustained use, and a common and simple
          numbering approach uses three numbers separated by periods, followed
          by a build number. This is referred to here as
          <span class="emphasis"><em>three-number release identification</em></span> (or
          <span class="emphasis"><em>release IDs</em></span>). With this method, an example
          release number could look something like <span class="emphasis"><em>3.5.2 build
          13</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>3.5.2 B13</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#release_numbers_illustrated" title="Figure 6-2. Release numbers illustrated">Figure 6-2</a>).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0380"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="release_numbers_illustrated"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e5312"/><img alt="Release numbers illustrated" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266081.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 6-2. Release numbers illustrated</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The first number is the <span class="emphasis"><em>major release
          number</em></span>, sometimes known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>marketing
          number</em></span>. This number is incremented no more than once a
          year, and it rarely gets far into the teens for most projects,
          because customers perceive <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0381"/>version numbers such as <span class="emphasis"><em>17.0.1</em></span> to
          be too old and outdated for their purposes—they expect a new major
          release instead of an updated old one. For long-lived products with
          many releases, marketing typically renames the product with a major
          rollout instead of issuing a new release number. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0382"/>Mature products do not undergo future major releases,
          only minor ones, limiting the first number.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0383"/></p><p>The second number defines the <span class="emphasis"><em>minor release
          number</em></span>, which represents feature changes rather than
          substantial changes to the system. A minor release occurs regularly
          during the year. Either <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> or
          <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> works for a starting value, but it should be
          consistent.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0384"/></p><p>The third number, the <span class="emphasis"><em>patch release
          number</em></span>, changes when a small defect is repaired (with a
          patch) in an existing release. This number can start with either
          <span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> but should be
          consistent.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>build number</em></span> tracks the software
          executable version during the release cycle. For convenience
          purposes, most build systems auto-increment the build number with
          each new executable. A development cycle for a release requires the
          creation of multiple builds, which engineering and QA then evaluate
          and test. With such an iterative process, the build number uniquely
          identifies the final build from earlier builds of the
          release.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0385"/></p><p>These examples help illustrate how to apply numbers to a
          sequence of releases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>1.0.0 B104: Initial release</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1.1.0 B99: A minor release with notable changes</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1.2.0 B57: Another minor release with notable

          <span class="emphasis"><em>encourage</em></span> them. That's an important
          distinction. Treat patch releases as an admission of a mistake, not
          as a quick opportunity to drop in another feature. Marketing might
          put pressure on engineering to add a critical feature to a patch
          release, but resisting this temptation will allow the required patch
          to be released quickly and with properly focused testing. Adding new
          features should always move the release into the minor release
          category, which requires more testing and time to ensure proper
          quality.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0387"/></p><p>Patch releases do require full regression testing to ensure
          that the patch does not make the product fail. Hence, patch releases
          have a high cost per benefit compared to a regular release.</p><p>Some companies avoid <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0388"/>patch releases and bundle many patch issues into a
          quickly created minor release. This approach can be effective, but
          only if the minor releases go out often enough that your customers
          aren't suffering from the lingering problems.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="component_numbers_vs_release_numbers"/>Component Numbers vs. Release Numbers</h2></div></div></div><p>Software releases commonly include more than one component or
          product that a customer uses. In a multi-component release, some
          components interact with other components, thus requiring a
          simultaneous release. The choice on how to label release components
          is both a marketing and engineering decision, because it has
          implications on customer perception, customer service, defect
          tracking, and engineering defect investigations. Consider the issues
          related to different component naming strategies while your company
          is in the startup stage, rather than waiting until your company is
          in the growth stage.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-6-FNOTE-1" id="CHP-6-FNOTE-1">4</a>]</sup> A thoughtful component naming convention allows you to
          track the dependent pieces and use these names in discussions
          internally and with customers.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0389"/></p><p>Each customer-viewable component in a release requires a
          unique identifier. One approach is to allow the components to keep
          individual numbers that change when the component changes and then
          bundle them together into the release. Another approach is to assign
          all the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0390"/>components in the release the same release number
          regardless of whether they have changed.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#two_approaches_to_component_numbering" title="Figure 6-3. Two approaches to component numbering">Figure 6-3</a>

          different numbers to be used for each component. In this approach,
          the numbers advance only when the component is changed. Tracking
          down components for a past release can be difficult down the road,
          however. A table showing the mapping must be publicly available and
          kept up to date so that teams working on the code can easily
          identify the source <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0392"/>version of particular user-reported problems. Relying
          only on the source control system to track this is a poor strategy

          components to the release number. The modules all get their numbers
          advanced to the release number even if no code changes. This
          approach makes it much easier to track what changes are included in
          which modules in each release. Determining the history of defects in
          each release is much easier with common release numbering.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="numbering_across_releases"/>Numbering Across Releases</h2></div></div></div><p>Numbering across releases has several different driving
          concerns. Most software consumers expect release numbers to be
          sequential. Development organizations assign release numbers early,
          often before development has a clear idea of what will go in each
          release.</p><p>Early release numbering can cause problems with sequential
          release numbering. Early release numbering reflects the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>future</em></span> planned release order. The original
          intent for the release numbers was to release them in sequence, but
          this does not always work out.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#release_numbers_fixed_at_project_start" title="Figure 6-4. Release numbers fixed at project start">Figure 6-4</a>
          illustrates an example of out-of-sequence release numbers. At the
          start of release 2.3.4, the plan was to release 2.3.4 first and then
          2.3.5. In this case, development delayed release 2.3.4, while 2.3.5
          shipped as planned. Following release 2.3.5, development released
          number 2.3.4, and now the numbering is out of order.</p><p>A company can live with an out-of-order release sequence;
          however, an alternative approach is to renumber future releases so
          that numbers are always sequential. Sequential numbering avoids
          confusion months or years later when, inevitably, problems occur in
          a past release. Referring to <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#release_numbers_fixed_at_project_start" title="Figure 6-4. Release numbers fixed at project start">Figure 6-4</a>, when the
          planned 2.3.4 release does not release before 2.3.5, you should
          retire the number 2.3.4 as a non-release and rename it with the next
          incremental number, 2.3.6. Do not increment the number until it is
          clear where final delivery will fall relative to other releases. For
          this example, the timeline would look like that shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#release_numbers_always_sequential_at_rel" title="Figure 6-5. Release numbers always sequential at release">Figure 6-5</a>. One caution
          when you renumber a release: Make certain that the documentation and
          the source code identifiers use the new number.</p><div class="figure"><a id="release_numbers_fixed_at_project_start"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e5492"/><img alt="Release numbers fixed at project start" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266085.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 6-4. Release numbers fixed at project start</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="figure"><a id="release_numbers_always_sequential_at_rel"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e5500"/><img alt="Release numbers always sequential at release" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266087.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 6-5. Release numbers always sequential at release</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="software_for_the_gentleman_farmer"/>Software for the Gentleman Farmer</h2></div></div></div><p>For a humorous cross-section of component numbering

          hobby farms but don't have much farming experience. You produce a
          suite of products. The main product is FarmingBreak, and you also
          provide add-on programs to help with specific activities and crops:
          CowBreak, CornBreak, and WheatBreak. Customers must buy the main
          program, FarmingBreak, to use any of the add-on programs. After the
          first release, your products were all numbered 1.0. The version
          number of each product is visible on the product's user

          feature set, so you provide an upgraded version four months after
          your first release. As you map out the next release, you realize
          that you have a numbering choice. You can do one of the
          following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Increment all items to version 1.1 and recompile all the
              modules to match.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Increment only CowBreak to 1.1 and leave the other
              products numbered at 1.0.</p></li></ul></div><p>You decide to take the easy way out and modify only CowBreak.
          This avoids having to increment the number for all products to 1.1
          and then explain to customers that nothing has changed.</p><p>Later you reach another decision point for the WheatBreak
          upgrade release. Should you call it 1.1 or go to 1.2? You elect to
          call it 1.1. Immediately after the release, a major problem is
          found, so you have to send out a patch. After the patch, WheatBreak
          is numbered 1.1.1.</p><p>You again modify CowBreak and name it 1.2 to add major dairy
          functionality.</p><p>As your business progresses, you map out a release to
          FarmingBreak, which you decided to call version 1.1. However, you
          have to change the database, and all of the products need to be
          recompiled to new versions, so you up their numbers. Now you have
          FarmingBreak at 1.1, WheatBreak at 1.2, CowBreak at 1.3, and
          CornBreak at 1.1. For new customers, this doesn't pose a huge
          problem—you just send them the latest versions of your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0396"/>software regardless of the number.</p><p>A few years down the road, your products are at the following
          version numbers: FarmingBreak 1.8, WheatBreak 1.9.2, CowBreak 1.4,
          CornBreak 1.5.3, and SoyBreak 1.1.3. During this time, you make one
          more database change that is incompatible with past versions. A
          customer calls with a problem in FarmingBreak 1.5 that you recall
          fixing a while back in FarmingBreak 1.6. The customer also has
          CornBreak 1.3.1 and SoyBreak 1.1. You agree to ship him an updated
          FarmingBreak copy, but you can't remember whether his other products
          are compatible or not. Furthermore, he doesn't want to upgrade to
          your latest versions, as he heard they were slow—so that eliminates
          the easy solution. At this point, you don't have version
          compatibility at hand and can't easily tell what is compatible,
          since you didn't keep all the products synchronized in version
          number. To resolve this situation, you stay up all night and read
          your notes until you can figure out which version numbers go with
          the customer's release. You then re-create those versions to ship to
          the customer, since you didn't save compiled copies, only the
          source.</p><p>Vowing to clean up some of your mistakes, when you make some
          major upgrades to FarmingBreak, you increment all your products to
          2.0 and archive copies of the code. From now on, you will keep your
          product numbers synchronized so you won't have to keep capability
          notes. Version 2.0 is a success.</p><p>With success in hand, you announce to the press that version
          2.1 is due out in six months. Two months after the announcement,
          your marketing team (yes, your company has grown) insists that
          CucumberBreak must have an immediate release in one month to deal
          with a strong competitor. Now you have a problem: If you call
          CucumberBreak version 2.1, then your main release will have to
          become 2.2, but you already announced it as 2.1 and have done all of
          your internal planning using that number. Hmm … maybe you jumped too
          quickly to synchronized numbering. You decide to keep the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>main release</em></span> name as 2.1, but you allow release
          components to have numbers out of synchronization with the release.
          Going forward, you will keep careful records of component
          capability.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#CHP-6-FNOTE-1" id="ftn.CHP-6-FNOTE-1">4</a>] </sup>See the book's introduction for definitions of various

      be used to protect <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0398"/>intellectual property, produce quality code, and manage
      operations efficiently. Although large companies can afford a large
      support staff to maintain tools and enforce the use of specific
      approaches, small companies do not often have that luxury.</p><p>Failing to protect your company's <span class="emphasis"><em>intellectual
      property</em></span> is gambling with your company's assets and
      shareholder value. <span class="emphasis"><em>Intellectual property</em></span> doesn't
      just refer to your company's code, it also includes how you build and
      release your product, your ideas and data, how you track defects (bugs)
      and the defect data, and what technical documentation you create. A
      large component of a small company's value consists of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0399"/>intellectual property. If your company is being sold, the
      purchasing company considers the intellectual property as part of the
      offer price. If you have poorly maintained your company's intellectual
      property, then the buyer will see less value and make a lower offer for
      your company.</p><p>To protect your intellectual property, and ultimately your
      company's value, review your tools and the methods you use in at least
      the following areas:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span>Data backup</span> Have a systematic and
        automatic approach to creating secure secondary backup copies of data

        documentation for internal use.</p><p><span>Source code control and configuration
        management</span> Track and archive source code files during and
        after <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0400"/>development, and identify sets of files into defined
        releases.</p><p><span>Software builds</span> Control how the
        software source creates the executable code that clients can
        use.</p><p><span>Bug tracking</span> Use appropriate
        technology to track defects (bugs) and their repair.</p><p><span>Release method</span> Employ the
        appropriate methods and technology to release your software.</p></blockquote></div><p>Consider <span class="emphasis"><em>tools and methods</em></span> in terms of your

        of protection for your company's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0401"/>intellectual property. Without a backup mechanism in
        place, all intellectual property can disappear instantly if it resides
        on your server's disk drives, because disk drives can and do fail for
        a number of reasons. In addition, without having secure <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0402"/>backups, you can lose intellectual property due to a
        fire, a malicious hacker, or a malevolent employee. A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0403"/>development manager must either ensure that a backup
        mechanism exists or immediately direct its creation. If a separate IT
        organization backs up your intellectual property, you should review
        the organization's backup strategy. Often you will be surprised to
        find that your important data is not a part of their backup
        strategy.</p><p>Several best practices are recommended for file backup. You can
        customize these to your company's needs based on costs and staffing
        requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Full copies of files are stored on permanent media (tape or
            CD, for example) and are not overwritten.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Full copies are stored on a regular basis in an offsite
            location.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Users are notified about which parts of the file system are
            backed up so that they can appropriately store their critical
            data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Backup copies are made daily. A company usually can't afford
            to lose more than a day's data.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e5707"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Source control and configuration management tools are used
            and the repository is backed up. To be effective, this requires
            team discipline, as the team needs to check files into the
            repository often.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Restoration of files from the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0404"/>backups is tested periodically. Otherwise, system

            disaster has struck. Common causes of backup problems are ignored
            error messages in the backup logs, unexpected mechanical device
            failures, and the omission of needed files from the backup list.
            Test your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0406"/>backups at least once a quarter.</p></li></ul></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-5"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Backup failures discovered after disaster strikes

        different trade-offs for complexity, cost, risk, time to implement,
        and time to recover data. Your choice will depend on how you determine
        the relative balance of these needs for your company. Common backup
        approach considerations include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Amount of disk space to include in the backup</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Choice of backup media</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Amount of automation in the backup process</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ease of use of the equipment versus associated costs to

              daily incremental backups</p></li></ul></div><p>Companies also use variations on these approaches. <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#three_backup_approaches" title="Figure 7-2. Three backup approaches">Figure 7-2</a> illustrates these
          approaches.</p><div class="figure"><a id="three_backup_approaches"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e5783"/><img alt="Three backup approaches" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266091.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 7-2. Three backup approaches</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>These approaches trade off administrator time and backup media
          space for ease and availability of data recovery. <span class="emphasis"><em>Daily
          full backups</em></span> require the most backup media and
          potentially the most operator time, depending on the equipment used
          to perform the backup. However, a full backup approach allows you to
          restore files using a single day's stored backup, while other
          approaches do not permit this. You should start with this approach.
          When the backup time starts taking too long, try <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0407"/>differential backups.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0408"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Weekly full backups plus daily differential
          backups</em></span> from the last full backup takes less time during
          the week than full backups. However, in some cases you might need
          two sources of backup media to recover multiple files. The extra
          effort in recovery and the time to recover creates an effort "hill"
          you'll need to climb to recover files. This extra effort can make
          the backup administrator slow or reluctant to locate file versions
          that have been inadvertently lost. This approach works well for
          companies in the growth stage.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0409"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0410"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Monthly full backups with weekly differential and
          daily incremental backups</em></span> require the fewest number of
          backup media and administrator efforts over a given month. However,
          a series of tapes can be required to recover a set of files. Set up
          each weekly <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0411"/>differential to cover all files that changed since the
          weekly backup (and not the last weekly). Avoid this approach unless
          you must back up large amounts of data and you have limited backup
          capabilities, or you are not concerned with time involved for file
          recovery during normal business operations.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0412"/></p><p>If full or full-plus-incremental <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0413"/>backups don't seem right for your situation, you can
          use other strategies regarding frequency and amount of data for your
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0414"/>backups. For example, the backup administrator could
          modify the approach to conduct <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0415"/>full backups every <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> day.
          This would save backup time, but it increases the loss risk to two
          days' work instead of one day's work. Alternatively, the
          administrator could perform the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0416"/>incremental backups to cover only a single day's
          changes. An example would be setting Friday's incremental backup to
          cover only Friday's changed files instead of all the changes that
          occurred since the last full backup. Recovering the system to
          Friday's state would require the last full backup media plus all the
          incremental backups created that week. However, with this approach,
          the daily backups will take less time during the week. This
          modification trades administrator time for decreased cost to recover
          files.</p><p>In general, you should choose the simplest backup and recovery
          approach when you're starting out—probably one of the first two
          options. As the data grows, look at other strategies and consider
          changing your backup equipment to minimize administrator effort.
          However, don't skimp on performing proper backups on important
          information because the backups take too much time.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="offsite_copies"/>Offsite Copies</h2></div></div></div><p>Regardless of the backup approach you choose, you should move
          your backup copies offsite to another location on a regular basis.
          Your choice of backup schedule reflects the trade-off of effort and
          risk. On the risk side, consider how many days of development work
          your company could afford to lose as part of disaster recovery. On
          the effort side, consider how much time your company can afford to
          spend making additional copies and moving them offsite.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0417"/></p><p>As tapes can be required to recover lost files, consider the
          time hit spent creating tapes for shipment offsite. An expensive and
          time-consuming approach is to create duplicate copies for onsite and
          offsite copies every night. Most small companies use a simple
          approach of alternating onsite and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0418"/>offsite storage of their full backup copies. This
          approach is not very expensive, but it makes file recovery more
          difficult when you need to recover a file that is stored in an
          offsite backup.</p><p>Some customers might compel you to keep offsite copies of
          product code. Additionally, some customer contracts can require
          <span class="emphasis"><em>software escrow</em></span> (periodic archiving of your
          source code with a third party). Customers ask for software escrow
          to minimize their risk; if your company fails, the customer receives
          a copy of the source code. This requirement forces periodic full
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0419"/>backups of parts of your source code in addition to
          the regular <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0420"/>backups.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0421"/></p><p>Most small companies look for simple solutions to offsite
          backups. If you start with the assumption that a disaster will
          damage only your physical facility, then moving copies out of the
          facility will be sufficient. The media should be stored in a
          commercial backup storage facility or a second building in the same
          town—not at the administrator's home. Storing backup media in a
          person's home can be a problem if the person leaves the company (or
          the country).</p><p>To create your offsite backups, you could create an additional
          copy of each backup daily, but this would double your daily backup
          time. Instead, take full backups from your regular process offsite.
          If you need quick access to backup files in your facility, consider
          making duplicate copies of offsite backup media.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="disk-only_backup"/>Disk-Only Backup</h2></div></div></div><p>Some system administrators use a dangerous backup practice of
          making periodic image copies of disk files to another disk,
          overwriting the last copy. When used as the sole backup mechanism,
          this method suffers from many weaknesses:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0422"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Corrupt source files might corrupt the backup copy and
              permanent records do not exist.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A disgruntled employee can alter the data. The backup
              files will store a copy of the problem code as the administrator
              creates these periodically but does not create a permanent
              record.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Occasionally, hardware does fail. Although unlikely, both
              disks could fail, obliterating all your files.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Users can delete files by accident. If you discover a lost
              file after the administrator makes the backup image, you cannot
              recover the file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Disk-to-disk <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0423"/>backups are usually done with onsite disks.
              Consequently, if disaster strikes your building, you will have
              lost everything.</p></li></ul></div><p>In general, avoid <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0424"/>disk-only backup approaches in which you image your
          data and then overwrite the image. It will not help if you need to
          restore a file that was deleted weeks ago. Instead, back up to a
          permanent or stable medium. A disk-to-disk backup can be cost and
          time effective only if different images are made and saved regularly
          and a complete backup is kept on permanent media.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="creating_and_managing_development_docume"/>Creating and Managing Development Documentation</h1></div></div></div><p>You can improve your development team's productivity by making
        development documentation easy to create and access through wikis,
        intranets, or content management systems. This will encourage the
        creation and use of documentation. Not having a system will lead to
        minimal documentation being created and shared.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0425"/></p><p>Unfortunately, many managers ignore documentation during the
        company startup phase because of lack of interest and because its
        absence does not appear to be an immediate problem. A small team can
        track internal documents easily, but as the team and product line
        grows, tracking all the internal documentation becomes difficult
        because of the number of documents and versions that can exist.
        Locating the most current version of a file for a six-month-old
        project requires an archeologist's skill and patience when a
        documentation repository does not exist or the document creator is no
        longer with the company.</p><p>With no development documentation, the task of training new
        people is difficult. The lack of documentation also wastes the time of
        the current team as they try to locate information that doesn't exist.
        As individual engineers store pieces of essential information, lack of
        diversified information creates a bottleneck when a key engineer is
        not available—development can get stuck.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e5932"/></p><p>Small company development environments often release many
        projects in rapid succession; you can't expect developers to remember
        the details of projects from more than a few months back. The cost of
        poor documentation can be realized months or years later when
        developers badly need the information. Trying to understand someone
        else's code can be difficult enough; trying to understand the
        motivations of specific design decisions can be nearly
        impossible.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0426"/>Development documentation covers many topics in addition
        to functional specifications. Here is a sample list of categories to
        consider:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Product definition documents and specifications</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Technical background information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Internal design documentation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Customer system architecture</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Data file format information</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Database design schemas</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Process definitions</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Application programming interface (API) description</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Schedules</p></li></ul></div><p>You can use various methods to make internal documentation
        available in small firms. Simple methods include keeping the main copy
        on local directories of work machines, emailing copies of documents to
        those who need them, creating copies in shared directories, and
        creating intranet pages and links.</p><p>All of the simple approaches have drawbacks, however. Document
        submitters can find many categories in which to place a file, and the
        team can find it difficult to track down the desired information. In
        addition, when a developer locates the information, she might not be
        able to determine whether she found the current version. With some
        approaches, opening the documents requires many mouse clicks. Simple
        approaches limit the file or text formats that are acceptable and do
        not block simultaneous edits. Finally, simple approaches do not
        provide levels of restricted access, so everyone has full access to
        every document.</p><p>One reasonable solution is to set up a wiki with a tool such as
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0427"/>MediaWiki (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">http://www.mediawiki.org/</a>). <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0428"/>Wikis are simple to use, but creating and editing wiki
        pages is not always "what you see is what you get," or WYSIWYG—it can
        involve a multi-step process of cutting, pasting, and formatting
        information into the wiki from other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0429"/>documents. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0430"/>Wikis also require an administrator who can set up and
        maintain the site.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>content management system</em></span> provides a
        method for everyone to access and edit documentation. A number of
        great open source systems are available, with <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0431"/>Plone (<a class="ulink" href="http://plone.org/">http://plone.org/</a>) being
        one good example. Excellent commercial systems exist as well, such as
        Microsoft <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0432"/>Project Server.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0433"/></p><p>The benefits generally exceed the costs, however, as a good
        system will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Allow easy searches for files</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Allow different levels of access for different account
            groups</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make file uploads simple for all file types</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make reading documentation easy, requiring a single click to
            open and instantly view documents</p></li></ul></div><p>Multiple commercial and open source tools are available for use
        in creating collaboration sites. Selecting the proper content
        management tool, setting it up, and maintaining it constitutes a major
        project. In addition, the content system administrator will require
        time to set up the system and organize the data. You will need to
        assign a person to drive the process.</p><p>All data storage systems need a <span class="emphasis"><em>gardener</em></span> to
        keep them organized. Without constant maintenance, the data in the
        systems quickly becomes "weedy" and out of date. As the data grows,
        the administrator will reorganize the layout as needed and manage or
        archive data that has become too old.</p></div>

        tag groups of files, and retrieve desired versions of files in a
        straightforward way. SCV software allows a team of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0434"/>development engineers to work on a product
        collaboratively, effectively sharing the use of a common set of source
        files. SCV software acts as a traffic cop to avoid file collisions and
        an archivist to track which files correspond with which product
        version.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0435"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0436"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0437"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e6065"/></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0438"/>SCV software supports the definition of <span class="emphasis"><em>named

        software, you can re-create a named version of the code later. SCV
        software also helps manage conflicts when two developers want to use
        the same file at the same time. An engineer can reserve, or
        <span class="emphasis"><em>lock</em></span>, a file for editing, preventing other
        engineers from modifying that file while it is locked. Without SCV
        locks, an engineer working on a file could find her changes
        overwritten by another engineer who modifies the same particular
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0439"/>source file.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-6"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Review the default behavior of your system for file

          files only when specifically requested to do so. Choose and

        first engineer's changes after the lock is released. Newer SCV systems

        management rarely defines best practices for their use. It is a good

        errors and potential team friction. These include the following
        practices.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>For single-repository systems: Allow

              out a file for modification at one time and avoids the potential
              for code merging. Automatic code merging causes problems that
              you might not see until after a release, because it can
              accidentally and silently remove earlier repairs from the
              system. An alternative is to require manual merging of
              <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0441"/>files for cases in which multiple engineers need
              to work together. If a developer must perform a manual merge of
              files, he can carefully inspect the merged code sections. If
              they overlap, the developer can create a new version of the code
              to incorporate both sets of changes as appropriate. Even with a
              careful merge, the merged code often has unexpected behavior
              because each engineer built his code from what was previously
              there, not accounting for the others' changes.</p><p>When planning work, ask developers to examine the sections
              of the code with which they need to work in advance and set up a
              process that avoids coding collisions. Developers can work
              around each other, communicating clearly about where in the code
              they are working and being considerate about how long they check
              out common files.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-6"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This recommendation does not apply to systems

        resist using a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0448"/>SCV system because of the extra effort involved in
        setting them up and using them. Startup engineers can resist SCV
        systems on cultural grounds, as they like the idea of working "fast
        and loose." In this environment, you'll need to provide careful
        preparation and introduction of the system. Involve the engineers in

        use for extracting the desired versions of source files, creating one
        or more executable versions of the code, and then storing it in the
        appropriate location for use. A standardized software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0449"/>build method ensures that one set of source files
        compiles into the same program, thereby avoiding the potential errors
        of manual program creation. Usually, the build method interacts with
        the source control tool.</p><p>In small companies, software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0450"/>build methods often start out being ad hoc designs.
        Different programs have different <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0451"/>build methods because the methods were created by
        different engineers, probably at different times. Ad hoc designs are
        often problematic, and few people know how to use them. One engineer
        might be the only person who knows how to build certain program
        executables.</p><p>You must ensure that the build process for each product is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>written down</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>tested successfully by
        a second engineer</em></span>. Having a second engineer go through the
        steps of building the code usually ensures that the instructions are
        correct. Often the creator of the instructions will leave out details
        or make mistakes because she knows the process too well. Ask the
        engineer in charge of the build to include a list of common problems
        that could occur and potential solutions to these problems.</p><p>When builds are done regularly, productivity is affected as
        well. Most small companies start out creating builds as needed. As the
        team grows larger, build collisions occur, with two engineers trying
        to build the code set at the same time, but using different files. At
        this point, regular builds become essential.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Daily builds</em></span> work best, although
        development can build the software less often. At some companies the
        daily builds are really <span class="emphasis"><em>nightly builds</em></span> that occur
        every evening. With daily builds, the build administrator finds file
        check-in mistakes daily, instead of later in the development cycle. In
        addition, the team will not push to delay a build so they can add more
        features or code—with weekly or less regular builds, the team might be
        tempted to delay weekly builds to accommodate last-minute changes. The
        team will also discover code integration problems after a while,
        making the debugging and repair considerably more difficult.</p><p>Building software during working hours has advantages over
        nightly builds. Daytime builds allow the team to see problems
        immediately so that the developer who created the problem can fix it
        quickly. With a nighttime <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0452"/>build, the developer who created the problem might not
        return to work until later in the morning, leaving other developers
        with the task of cleaning up the problem or sitting idle, waiting for
        the developer's return.</p><p>With either nightly or daily <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0453"/>builds, the developer who creates the problem should be
        held responsible for fixing it promptly. Breaking the build breaks the
        team's momentum and adds delays to the project. As developers can
        perform trial compiles and tests in their own local accounts, they
        have few excuses for breaking the build.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-9"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The best approach is for the build administrator to
          configure development sandboxes at the start of the project to
          ensure consistency of layout and versions. Mismatched sandboxes can
          lead to broken builds after check-in of code</em></span>.</p></div><p>As the code becomes more complex and the team grows larger, you
        should hire a single person to control and monitor daily software
        builds: a <span class="emphasis"><em>build engineer</em></span>. The build engineer
        builds the software, maintains the build <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0454"/>tools, and reviews build problems from the previous
        night. Require the build engineer to pursue build problems until they
        have been resolved.</p><p>In summary, you should move from an ad hoc build system to a
        repeatable system that runs regularly. Do not wait until your company
        is in growth mode to set up the system. Document this system and have
        an alternative engineer trained to understand how it works. Finally,
        treat your build system as an important part of your development
        infrastructure.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="software_release_process"/>Software Release Process</h1></div></div></div><p>The software release process describes the tools and methods
        required to get the software into the customer's hands. A release
        process moves the executable and supporting files into the release
        location. The process can include automatic changes to the database,
        creation of multiple image copies of files for multiple servers, and
        changing of file attributes so they correctly run on the production
        machine.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0455"/></p><p>As software distribution models vary considerably, release
        processes vary as well. The mechanisms of the process include customer
        downloads from a website, CD distributions, or files copied to
        customer-acceptable servers.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e6288"/></p><p>Like many processes, the software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0456"/>release process in small companies is usually ad hoc. As
        the software and product line become more complex, the frequency of
        release mistakes will increase, as each release is often a slight
        variation on a basic theme, providing opportunities for typing
        mistakes or mistaken assumptions about what is required to use the
        release.</p><p>At many small companies, only one person knows how to release
        the product—releasing software is a thankless task and not interesting
        to many engineers. If the engineer releases the code properly, nobody
        notices; if the engineer makes a mistake, everyone complains. Making
        the release effort more appealing to engineers is difficult, but
        showing appreciation for the engineer's effort is always worthwhile.
        In general, spread the release knowledge around the team and make it
        as simple as possible. Ensure that the release engineer writes down
        the process clearly and that at least two other people know the
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0457"/>release process.</p><p>You should automate the release process as much as possible.
        Release automation can be as simple as shell scripts, or you can
        include more complex scripts or commercial programs. In all cases,
        automation not only shortens release time, but it reduces release
        errors. Serious release mistakes can take days of engineering work and
        recovery time.</p><p>As the company grows, teams other than engineering can take over
        the release process, such as members of the IT or operations groups.
        Not having releases assigned to your team does not mean that you can
        ignore associated problems, however. Work with the managers of the
        other teams to improve the release workflow. Some additional
        engineering effort can lead to savings for the company overall.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="right_instructions_wrong_order"/><p class="title"><b>RIGHT INSTRUCTIONS, WRONG ORDER</b></p><p>Our company had a separate release engineer who released the

        abuses of a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0464"/>defect-tracking tool. Avoid these strategies at all

            development makes the repair and assigns the defect ticket back to
            submitters for review.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Reported problems are ignored by the assigned engineer
            because no process for nagging the engineer exists.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Submitters enter a defect so badly worded that nobody can
            figure out the problem or whether a problem even exists. When
            asked, the submitter does not remember what he was concerned
            about.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Defect submissions describe ten different problems in one

            the ticket out or track any of the problems individually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A defect submitter assigns the problem an incorrect and
            unusual status state, making the defect untracked.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A submitter enters a core-dump error message into the defect

            read after a few exchanges.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A support team member pastes in a 50-page customer email

        is usually necessary. Without enforcement and review of data in a
        bug-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0466"/>tracking system, so much junk data gets stored that
        people ignore older defects. Ensure that the defect tool has a clear
        process associated with it and enforce the process. A great way to
        enforce the process is to have a gatekeeper or gardener for the bug
        system who is responsible for the health of the bug data, not the
        system per se.</p><p>As part of the defect system process, define and enforce
        standards for <span class="emphasis"><em>resolution notes</em></span>. Resolution notes
        describe how the defect was resolved and are useful to the submitter,
        but they are also helpful in defect analysis and end-of-project
        reviews. Train other teams that use the bug-tracking system in proper
        system use, including customer service, sales, marketing, technical
        writing, and any consultants. Failure to train people will lead to
        extra effort in development dealing with the defects that people
        improperly submit.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0467"/></p><p>In summary, first make sure that your team has a useable
        defect-reporting system, and then ensure that your team has a proper
        process for using it. Monitor the usage and refer offenders to the
        proper correction institution. Finally, refer to <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. UNDERSTANDING QUALITY ASSURANCE">Chapter 17</a> for more information on

        can select at least one replacement system. Fortunately, in many small
        companies, the development manager can direct the choice of
        development tools. Having this choice gives you the flexibility to
        change and reconfigure systems as your needs change. This is not
        necessarily the case in large companies.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0468"/></p><p>Managers in startup companies often base their tool <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0469"/>selection on two criteria: familiarity and price
        (preferably, free). A thoughtful choice, however, will prevent future
        problems when the company grows and the product takes off.</p><p>Don't let price alone drive you toward selecting only from free,
        open source tools. Establish your long-term needs before ruling out
        buying a commercial tool. Since the cost of changing to a different
        tool later is usually very high, picking a tool based just on
        short-term finances will sometimes lead to painful development issues
        a few years later. If price must be an overriding factor (that is, if
        there literally is no money to spend), plan in advance for a
        transition strategy to your ideal tool when money is available.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="top-down_tool_selection"/><p class="title"><b>TOP-DOWN TOOL SELECTION</b></p><p>Many large companies do not give engineering management the
          choice of tools. They have multiple layers of management and many
          different projects. A senior technology manager removed from
          individual developers will choose the tools. Choice of tools will
          usually reflect several factors: price, technology features, ability
          to handle the largest and most complex project in the company, and
          what is commonly being used in different divisions.</p><p>However, if your group isn't currently using one of the newly
          chosen tools, libraries, or databases, then you will be forced to
          convert your software to the new tools whether it makes business
          sense or not.</p></div><p>Tool vendors can push hard during the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0470"/>selection process. Vendors may offer low introductory
        prices, free first-year licenses, bundled software, or promises of
        special future features. When considering these incentives, ask for a
        longer-term price guarantee for future purchases—ideally, five years.
        Do not include promises of future features in your decision process
        unless the feature description (along with a delivery date) is
        included in the purchase contract alongside a penalty clause. Once the
        sale is made, you may see your vendor's priorities change.</p><p>Smaller vendors may take special interest in making the sale to
        you because they can use your company as a reference account, get a
        sale, and have the potential for future sales automatically as your
        company grows. In contrast, larger vendors will likely press less
        hard, as their sales focus is likely to be larger companies willing to
        buy larger numbers of tools at once. As the selector, you may feel
        camaraderie and empathy for another small company trying to reach
        success; however, recognize this influence when making your decision.
        Do not make the wrong choice simply to help out another small
        company.</p><p>Once a development organization uses a tool, it can be expensive
        to replace, because of the costs associated with migrating the data
        and retraining the team. To make the best choice, create a table
        comparing tool options covering these areas:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span>Initial cost</span> Consider initial
          sale price and installation costs.</p><p><span>Impact on productivity</span> Weigh
          the savings in salary time due to more efficiency of the system and
          fewer errors.</p><p><span>Recurring costs</span> As you add more
          users, consider what happens to the cost per person. Some products
          have low introductory rates for small teams but can get expensive
          per person as your company grows. Nailing down the recurring costs
          as part of the original deal gives you perspective on the
          future.</p><p><span>Maintenance costs</span> Consider how
          much labor and maintenance the tool will require. A few tools
          require half- or full-time staff to maintain them for a good-sized
          team.</p><p><span>Integration with other tools</span>
          Know whether the tool integrates well with other tools—for example,
          consider whether a defect tool integrates with source control and
          whether the source control program integrates with the integrated
          development environments (IDEs) being used.</p><p><span>System performance after growth</span>
          Consider what the system performance will be when the team size
          grows.</p><p><span>Remote development</span> Know whether
          the system can handle users who are working remotely. Consider its
          effectiveness with different development centers overseas, if
          necessary.</p><p><span>Ease of use</span> Consider how easy
          the tool is to learn and use.</p><p><span>Data security</span> Does the tool
          manage your data securely so it won't be lost or revealed
          inadvertently?</p><p><span>Data access</span> Know whether data
          can be reasonably imported and exported, which allows for future
          migration and integration with other tools.</p></blockquote></div><p>Tool familiarity can be another trap in the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0471"/>selection process. Many people will choose a tool one of
        the team members is already familiar with instead of taking a risk
        with something new. A familiar tool has the benefit of less training
        time—at least for the person selecting it. However, choosing an
        inferior tool based on one person's familiarity can lead to team
        resentment, as other team members will have to live with the tool's
        problems. Tools are changing so rapidly that choosing a known tool can
        result in choosing an obsolete tool. Instead, spend the time to
        investigate other options rather than simply choosing what's familiar
        to you.</p><p>Time pressures often force managers to make decisions before
        they can fully assess a product. Delegating the investigation and
        recommendation of tool choices to an interested senior engineer can
        improve the selection process. Delegation of the investigation
        benefits you and the team because it helps build trust: You will have
        shown the team that you trust them with the company's interests as
        well as their own. In contrast, engineers can react negatively if you
        select a tool without their involvement.</p><p>Ask the engineer to deeply investigate at least three tools
        before making the recommendation. A deep investigation requires trying
        the tool with realistic data on real problems your team faces. This
        will ensure that the tool meets the team's needs not only on the
        surface, but also in practice.</p><p>Once the tool is chosen, make the selecting engineer the tool's
        champion. He should help other engineers with the transition, answer
        questions, and monitor the tool's use. Having the selecting engineer
        actively use the tool will let him understand its problems and
        investigate potential solutions. More of his credibility will be at
        stake for making the tool a success, and he will be more likely to
        ensure that his peers are satisfied with the choice, because he has to
        work with them daily.</p></div>

      whether the technologies being used are reliable and implemented with
      current best practices. This chapter provides an expanded discussion of
      considerations for each technology area.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="system_documentation"/>System Documentation</h1></div></div></div><p>Many small and growing companies do not sufficiently document
        their software or systems for many reasons, including lack of interest
        in doing the job, pressure to achieve short-term goals, changing
        definitions, and perceived lack of need. Most engineers want to write
        code, not technical documents. Time pressures can be considerable in
        small firms because the next delivery is always around the corner.
        Changing definitions make it difficult to keep documentation up to
        date. And the need is not perceived: The senior architect understands
        the system in detail, so why document it for others, when he can
        explain it?<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0477"/></p><p>Good system overview documentation is critical. Without it, your
        company faces long-term problems and lost opportunities. New engineers
        need a technical overview of the system as part of their initial
        training. In addition, as the development team makes changes to the
        system, they might not see the far-reaching effects of their changes
        without access to proper overview drawings and descriptions.
        Documentation is also important because your growing company might
        eventually face audits by customers or certification agencies (for
        example, Cardholder Information Security Program, or CISP, in the
        financial world). Audits usually require system documentation.
        Finally, if another company wants to buy your firm, it will review
        your technical documents as part of the due diligence.</p><p>Your first step in documenting your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0478"/>system is to create a <span class="emphasis"><em>system overview
        diagram</em></span>. You can obtain the information you need by
        interviewing development team members and possibly by gleaning data
        from any partial <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0479"/>documentation that exists. Create the diagram as a
        useful working document, not just fluff for sales presentations.
        Summarize the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0480"/>software and system correctly and in detail. Organize
        the diagram for easy understanding by rearranging the layout to
        minimize the number of crossing or overlapping lines. Make it visually
        consistent by using only a few box sizes and a few types of symbols.
        Finally, label paths and contents clearly and consistently.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0481"/></p><p>After creating the overview diagram, examine the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0482"/>system documentation for the amount of detail. Too
        little detail provides little utility, while too much detail makes the
        document difficult to use and maintain. Review the documentation to
        ensure that you have included enough information by asking these
        questions:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>Is the documentation sufficiently

              is a common occurrence. People who enjoy working in startup

            that removing a team member will not disrupt
            operations</span>?</span></dt><dd><p>Nobody on the team should be so critical that losing him
              or her would mean that production would fall apart. You should

              value of a software firm is its <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0485"/>intellectual property. Failing to build detailed

        the program or system to maintain acceptable performance as the volume
        of users and data increases significantly. Scalability means that the
        usability and speed of the system do not degrade significantly as
        usage increases. Obviously, at some level, all <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0494"/>systems will fail, but setting a reasonable maximum
        expected usage size and knowing that the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0495"/>software can handle that size is what <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0496"/>scalability is all about.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0497"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0498"/></p><p>When a young company starts developing a new project,
        development focuses first on creating core functionality, and
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0499"/>scalability is often an afterthought. The team might
        consider scalability of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0500"/>system at times, but this objective is not analyzed,

        sink a company if its <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0501"/>system fails or slows down when the volume reaches the
        peak. For example, without proper scalability design and testing,
        systems with high uptime requirements can fail at high load, sometimes
        in unexpected ways. These failures can result in the loss of customers
        or even a direct financial loss if your company has guaranteed system

        applications, and software for the entire system—a whole system
        overview in enough detail to analyze it. You can create a scaling
        model from a detailed diagram if you have reliable test data. If you
        do not yet have the test data, the diagram can direct you to the tests
        you need to run and help you identify potential failure points.</p><p>Various methods and tools can be used to evaluate systems,
        including commercial packages used by IT shops, modeling programs, and
        even Excel spreadsheets. Your choice of approach depends on the
        complexity of the system. You can use a spreadsheet successfully to
        build up scalability models for simple systems with the proper data.
        For complex systems, system-modeling tools are better choices.</p><p>Analysis alone does not ensure <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0503"/>system scalability; you must also create a test lab to
        experience in practice how the system performs. As most modern systems
        find the biggest delays in the data layer, senior database engineers
        usually run the labs and perform the analyses.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e6905"/></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0504"/>Scalability presents an ongoing problem to the
        development team, requiring vigilance as the team develops new code.
        Engineers not trained in database scaling can easily create queries
        that slow down the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0505"/>system. The engineer most experienced with database
        queries can review all database queries as part of the code review
        process. Finding and fixing a problem in the design phase is far less
        expensive than discovering the problem in a test lab.</p></div>

        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0506"/>system fails in ways that you did not expect and from
        which your software does not directly recover. <span class="emphasis"><em>Failure mode
        analysis</em></span> involves a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0507"/>systematic analysis of general ways the program or
        system can fail. Small company development teams often do not
        systematically examine how their product or service can break.
        Instead, most wait for a failure to occur and patch the system to fix
        it.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0508"/></p><p>Small company developers usually focus on making the product
        work, rather than looking for what will cause it to fail. Breaking the
        product is a job for quality assurance. However, the QA team does not
        have the insight into the internals of the code that are required to
        perform a proper risk analysis. Engineers themselves need to analyze
        the risks and failure modes of every product or system.</p><p>A failure mode review must examine the system as a whole and in
        parts. Failures can occur in components or in the interactions of
        several components; some single components might show no obvious
        failure issues, but their interactions with other components can cause
        the system to break. In addition, a review must consider how
        unexpected customer data or usage can affect the system, including the
        effects of unusual data, overload of data streams, data size issues,
        data rate issues, and timing issues.</p><p>External abnormal occurrences can also cause problems to the
        system and should be studied. Using a system diagram as your reference
        point, ask a series of questions about what could happen, such as the
        following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What happens if third-party vendors do not provide the

          data between two different data sets. The system had a
          synchronization problem that would occur a few times each month.
          When this occurred, an engineer would repair the problems directly
          in the database.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0509"/></p><p>While reviewing risk factors for the system, I starting asking
          questions about this failure mode and became concerned. Under
          certain conditions, the failure rate could be high—it would require
          a system problem and a failure in the monitoring of the system by
          the operations team. The architect believed they would never see
          this problem, as it required that a system problem would have to go
          unmonitored by the operations team for many hours. The system had
          real-time monitoring in place, so he believed it would not happen.
          As the company planned for increased system traffic volume over the
          next year, I insisted that we plug this failure mode in the next
          release.</p><p>A few months after the release, the meltdown system failure
          occurred, causing a key system component to stop. The operations
          team had turned off the monitoring of this server six months earlier
          without engineering's knowledge, because the monitoring code gave
          too many false warnings. By the time we discovered the problem, the
          improperly synchronized data far exceeded what we could have
          repaired manually. Fortunately, the automatic repair mechanism did
          the corrections and kept the system running. We were one system
          redundancy away from a complete meltdown of our business.</p><p>—Software manager</p></div><p>Scale the analysis based on the potential problems a failure
        would create. Although intense <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0510"/>failure mode analysis approaches can be used, most

        which failure could have an extreme adverse effect on the
        customer.</p><p>Requiring a systematic analysis of failure modes will improve
        the reliability of your product or system. As a manager, require an

        <span class="emphasis"><em>messaging</em></span> concern how you process your system's
        reasonably expected usage problems. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0511"/>Error handling occurs within normal operation of the
        system and allows for continued usage. It differs from failure modes,
        as failure modes represent system or product failure cases in which
        the system operation <span class="emphasis"><em>breaks</em></span>. With a failure mode,
        manual intervention is often required for recovery. With error
        handling, the processing is routine and part of normal product usage.
        Error messaging describes the message sent to the user when the error
        is detected and is sometimes used to describe all of error
        handling.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0512"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0513"/></p><p>Error handling is designed as the product is created. When an
        engineer sees a use case that results in a detectable error, she
        creates an exception case in the code to handle it while informing the
        user about the problem. However, development teams often do not
        examine the messages after the initial creation, causing many error
        messages to go untested and ignored.</p><p>Development teams in young companies rarely document error
        conditions because the lack of error documentation does not block
        sales and does not cause short-term problems. However, not documenting
        error conditions opens testing holes and opportunities for failure
        modes to occur as part of the error processing. For example, an
        untested warning message, when activated, can cause the program to
        fail or cause database corruption. In addition to identifying problems
        earlier, documenting error conditions helps QA test efforts and
        simplifies internationalization of your software. Knowing the error
        conditions will also support risk analysis. With all of these
        benefits, it is best to create error documentation before your company
        enters its growth phase.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e7028"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-10"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A good standard practice is for QA to test all error

          the error resolution code</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0514"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0515"/></p></div><p>To create the error documentation, request a list of all the
        error phrases in the system from your development team. Ask the team
        to identify error conditions that are not currently associated with a
        textual message. Use this information to improve the product's
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0516"/>error handling by creating log file records. This can
        improve your testing because you can create targeted test cases to
        activate those error conditions. Documentation should cover the
        general error modes, error display, and error recovery. In addition,
        document error conditions that only a system administrator of your
        product would see. These conditions are often neglected in
        testing.</p><p>It's also useful to review error messages for reasonable
        practices. Since developers focus first on the successful workflow,
        they might not spend much time thinking about the unsuccessful
        workflows. For unsuccessful workflows, developers should consider the
        following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>Does a recovery path exist to resolve
            the issue for the customer</span>?</span></dt><dd><p>A good recovery path puts the user back to the location

              a different way or at least save his data.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>Does the error message provide

        expanding the product with new feature sets and capabilities.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>System maintainability</em></span>, on the other hand,
        describes the ease of coding bug repairs and adding minor features.
        Both are determined by the architecture and techniques used to create
        the code and resulting quality of the code.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0517"/></p><p>When engineering builds product code with flexibility and
        maintainability in mind, the company gains a long-term corporate
        advantage. Flexible code can be a decisive factor in product success,
        because cost and time to market is critical for small companies. With
        maintainable code, the lower overall cost of working on the code,
        especially when someone other than the author is doing the work, can
        mean the difference between success and failure for a growing company
        in a competitive market. Understanding the state of the code will
        allow you to make much better predictions about the costs of making
        major changes to your product.</p><p>As head of engineering, you need to know the flexibility aspects
        of your company's code as well as its maintainability. These things
        affect both short-term and long-term planning: In the short term,
        maintainability and flexibility affect the cost of repairs. In the
        long term, maintainability and flexibility affect your decision of
        when to overhaul or replace the current code.</p><p>Many small companies lack foresight about how code will be
        reused across the system. With few customers on board, receiving the
        proper input to plan for the future can be challenging. If the team
        focuses on quick delivery, programmers will often reinvent similar
        code rather than ensure that the code offers maximum reuse. This
        approach creates a maintenance nightmare, however, because the code
        now contains many different versions of similar functions. As the
        product changes and grows, changes to functionality will require far
        more effort, as each different version of the function will need to be
        modified. Because developers implement functions in different ways,
        the cost of modifying two similar functions with one change can be
        more than twice the cost of merging the function code from the
        start.</p><p>Software maintenance problems build up over time and are
        sometimes unnoticed because they amount to small increments in a total
        effort.</p><p>However, when they become more important because of
        significantly slower development efforts and more quality issues, the
        difficulty in recovering can be too large to be easily
        resolved.</p><p>Consider the following two cases, observed "in the wild" and
        related to flexibility and maintainability of code:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>Engineering builds the software to
            minimize costs, but intends to replace the software at a specific
            time</span>.</span></dt><dd><p>Engineering should test this assumption with the executive
              team before building the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0518"/>system in this way. Don't surprise your company
              with a quickly built system that cannot be modified easily.
              Instead, let the executive team know and get their buy-in before
              opting for this choice.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>New customers are supported by
            engineering copying old code and customizing it to meet the
            customer's needs</span>.</span></dt><dd><p>This provides a short-term boost but a long-term disaster.
              The problems associated with copy-and-customize do not justify
              the quick support provided for new customers. The maintenance
              cost of the application multiplies with each copy. Changes
              development makes to improve one customer's code base are not
              portable to another customer's code base; this situation stalls
              out your product development and turns your efforts into custom
              coding.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Regarding both flexibility and maintainability, you need to make
        conscious choices and get buy-in from the executive team, and you
        should continue to be aware of your product's status. There is no
        "one-size-fits-all" solution to flexibility and maintainability
        problems. Different product roadmaps have different requirements and
        expectations as to when the software will be overhauled or
        replaced.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="third-party_packages_integrated_into_the"/>Third-Party Packages Integrated into the System</h1></div></div></div><p>In most small software companies, the development team
        integrates <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0519"/>third-party code into the product because it shortens
        development time. You need to identify and document these packages for
        a number of reasons:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0520"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Potential investors will request this information as part of

            for the package, leaving you with a major problem.</p></li></ul></div><p>To determine what packages have been included in a system, ask
        the system architect to create a list. (Do not be surprised if no
        documentation exists.) Turn the list into a one-page summary and make
        it available to the development team for review. Then, ask the team to
        identify potential risks, including those that might appear as the
        product usage grows. Example risks include scalability issues, quality
        concerns, and overall utility.</p><p>Once you have documented a list of third-party packages, assign
        a senior engineer to maintain this list and make it easily available.
        This will help avoid a crisis when trying to pull the information
        together at the last minute and will keep the team thinking about the
        impact of integrating new packages into the product.</p><p>Analyzing the third-party code in the existing system does bring
        to light the process of "make versus buy" decisions. With all of the
        potential problems that third-party code can present, why use it at
        all? For most small companies, cash is limited, so getting a product
        to market quickly is a key goal. The best strategy for achieving this
        goal is to create only the sections of the product that are not
        currently available as third-party packages and buy the rest, but only
        when the business case makes sense. When reviewing the business case,
        you should consider all the issues raised in this section as well as
        cost and time to build compared to cost and time to buy and integrate.
        A good rule of thumb is this: Buy when the cost and time are less than
        or nearly equal to the build option.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="system_application_programming_interface"/>System Application Programming Interface</h1></div></div></div><p>Small company development teams commonly underdocument

        allows customers and other companies to communicate with your product
        or system through a data or software interface. Most modern programs
        use an API because it provides huge flexibility and speed
        advantages.</p><p>Customers often complain because incomplete documentation forces
        them to make assumptions about how the product API works. This can
        lead to wasted customer efforts and demands to change the
        implementation. Incomplete documentation also forces costs back onto
        your company, as your development and support teams have to answer
        questions about proper usage. A poorly documented API probably has not
        been completely tested either, leaving your customers to find
        problems, especially with lesser-used features.</p><p>Review the current API specification to ensure that it clearly
        states legal data values, interaction of data elements, error
        conditions, and error handling. If the documentation requires more
        information, ask an engineer and a documentation writer to fill in the
        gaps. If you create a solid API definition before your company hits
        its growth phase, your company will avoid serious problems with
        unhappy partners and customers (as well as the costs of supporting
        them).</p><p>API documentation needs more than just an interface
        description—it needs well-chosen use case examples. Providing an API
        description without use case examples is like handing someone a
        foreign language dictionary and expecting them to learn the language.
        Use cases should illustrate common usages that you expect your
        customers to integrate with their product to solve their problems. If
        you continue to update the descriptions as more customers use your
        product, the API document can be a positive asset in technical
        sales.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="security"/>Security</h1></div></div></div><p>Although many engineers consider product-usage <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0526"/>security an IT or operations team task, the engineering
        team should play the major role in creating a secure product.
        Consequently, you must make security an integral part of your
        development process. The most effective way to do this is to review
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0527"/>security elements as programmers develop the code and as
        QA tests it.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0528"/></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0529"/>Security often becomes a high-priority development issue
        when some driving event occurs—a customer asks questions about
        security before buying the product, a certifying organization requires
        a security audit, or a hacker breaks into the system. Don't wait until
        a driving event occurs. Instead, secure your product before being
        asked to do so, either by hiring an outside consultant or assigning
        the project to a team member. Whatever your choice, select one member
        from engineering and QA as the security gurus for their respective
        teams. Then ask them to spend time learning about security practices
        and testing methodologies.</p><p>Software security requires continuous focus during every
        development cycle. By assigning a software engineer to review the code
        for security flaws before QA tests the code, you can find problems
        earlier and improve security with less impact on cost and time.
        Security flaws found late in the development process can be very
        costly to fix.</p><p>Making security a priority in your system requires that you take
        extra measures. Consider acquiring security analysis tools appropriate
        for your product or system, and use them for every release. In
        critical systems, use a security consultant to review your system and
        identify problems. The additional costs are always justifiable by the
        results—problems identified before the product is released.</p><p>When determining how much to budget for the security effort,
        consider the types of security failures, the costs of each, and the
        probabilities of each. These costs will vary considerably based on the
        type of industry the product supports and the nature of the product.
        Devise a development plan in which sufficient money is spent on
        security to bring the failure probability multiplied by the cost down
        to a reasonable level.</p><p>Most companies do not spend enough time and effort building
        secure products or systems. More important, the effort spent is often
        at the wrong time in the development cycle—during testing or
        post-release recovery. But testing and repairing security in a built
        system is very expensive and sometimes impossible. As a practice,
        establish security requirements at the beginning, and then ensure they
        are considered and reviewed during the design.</p><p>Do not wait until an audit or hacker forces you into action,
        because your team will have a much greater problem improving
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0530"/>security after the software has been built. Take
        software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0531"/>security seriously, because the damage done by poor
        security can be impossible to repair later.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="data_reporting_and_analysis"/>Data Reporting and Analysis</h1></div></div></div><p>Many companies' products store customer data, especially if the
        company offers a web-hosted service. Small company systems commonly
        store customer data in a database from which the team designs SQL
        queries that allow the program code to access data. In addition to
        allowing programmers to enter and modify the data in the database,
        many products include a data-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0532"/>reporting functionality that is often added through
        separate modules or through a purchased reporting software
        package.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0533"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0534"/></p><p>A simple database approach can work well to get the initial
        product off the ground. As your customer base grows or the volume of
        queries grows significantly, however, the system will slow down. If
        this happens rapidly, your product's release cycle might not occur
        often enough to correct the problem before it becomes a huge
        issue.</p><p>Investigate the query speed of your product and estimate where
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0535"/>speed problems might occur. Also, estimate likely
        customer volume increases and timing. If you do this in advance, you
        will be prepared when speed might become an issue. Typically, query
        speed becomes an issue when your company enters a growth phase. You
        can minimize speed problems by carefully reviewing and testing SQL
        queries in a lab, but this will only get you so far. Large reports
        covering months or years of data will slow down over time. As a rule
        of thumb, when a report takes more than 10 seconds to display,
        customers become dissatisfied with the wait.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e7275"/></p><p>Database information displayed in reports can change over time.
        Customers find it disconcerting to see their data from two months ago
        change from what your system reported two months earlier. Changes
        happen because the algorithm for displaying the report changed or
        because parts of the underlying data changed. An example of underlying
        data change might be the removal of an account that the customer
        created in error and you closed. These inconsistencies can be handled
        in several ways: by letting the customer know about the volatility of
        past data and getting their acceptance; by restricting any changes to
        past <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0536"/>data even if the data contains errors; by modifying the
        database or business logic so that reports don't appear to change; or
        by using a data warehouse. A data warehouse, although expensive, can
        be a great solution in terms of both data consistency and
        speed.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="data_warehouse"/>Data Warehouse</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>data warehouse</em></span> stores snapshots
          summarizing the data at regular intervals with the goal of providing
          rapid access and consistency in responses. Common snapshot intervals
          are daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the data and the
          customer need. Data <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0537"/>warehouses are an expensive, albeit effective,
          approach to improving data <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0538"/>reporting.</p><p>Creating a data warehouse requires that you decide, in
          advance, what data to accumulate, how it's accumulated, and how it
          will be reported. While you can add reports to the data warehouse
          after it has been built, it should be initially designed to meet
          your long-term needs. Any changes added after the warehouse has been
          built do not become useful immediately, because data must accumulate
          before it can be of enough significance to measure in a report.
          Because creating a data warehouse has many pitfalls, you should hire
          someone with experience in data warehouse creation before taking
          this approach. Both database and IT experience are required to set
          up the warehouse properly.</p><p>A data warehouse solves the data change problem as well.
          Because the warehouse takes snapshots of data used to generate a
          report, the displayed data will not change even if the underlying
          data has changed. So, for example, monthly historical data will not
          change unless you run that month's generation routine again. This
          can be especially useful when the formula for calculating some of
          the presented data necessarily had to change over time, but the new
          formula isn't appropriate for the older data. On the other hand, for
          customers who want to propagate changes back in time, the data
          warehouse provides a means for doing this in a controlled manner.
          Such changes can be analyzed and proper business logic applied
          before running the program to update the warehouse, so that the
          changes are verified as correct and made when appropriate for the
          business needs.</p><p>Data warehouses are an order of magnitude more expensive than
          a pure database approach and are time consuming to set up and
          maintain.</p><p>Make sure that the need for a warehouse is justified from a
          business perspective before building it. For the following reasons,
          creating a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0539"/>data warehouse is an expensive <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0540"/>and lengthy task:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A data warehouse <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0541"/>often requires that you acquire additional
              hardware.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A data warehouse requires rewriting all of your reports
              and creating a program to generate the summary data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A data warehouse requires ongoing maintenance.</p></li></ul></div><p>Because of the costs and time delays, plan for a data
          warehouse <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> your company hits its growth
          phase to minimize the disruption. Waiting until data access becomes
          a problem will not allow your company enough time to solve the
          problem, as building a data warehouse can easily take six months or
          more.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="international_support"/>International Support</h1></div></div></div><p>Many web applications and some desktop applications require
        <span class="emphasis"><em>international support</em></span>, and that means much more
        than just translating English text into another language. It often
        requires rethinking and reworking parts of your software. In addition
        to language support, other issues include changes in user interfaces,
        changes to workflow because customers or business practices differ,
        legal issues related to site usage or guarantees, and currency issues
        if you are selling the product or the product deals with
        money.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0542"/></p><p>In most American startups, development builds the first product
        to support English-only for the US market. The introduction of support
        for other countries and languages often follows from sales
        opportunities rather than a technology plan. Ad hoc
        internationalization can lead to major surprises for development and
        the entire company due to the unexpected costs, lack of required
        expertise, and development delays.</p><p>Treat international support as a major release. Recognize that
        internationalizing your product will increase your operating costs and
        add release delay going into the future. You can implement
        internationalization during the company growth phase, but planning for
        it in advance can save you headaches later.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e7364"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e7367"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e7372"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-11"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Assessing the internationalization costs requires a

        adequate review. Trying to make all of the areas ideal may not be
        practical. In fact, for most business, the different areas vary in
        importance. A good approach is to review of all of the technological
        areas and assess which are terrible, which are tolerable, and which
        are great. Then, bring the terrible areas up to at least tolerable.
