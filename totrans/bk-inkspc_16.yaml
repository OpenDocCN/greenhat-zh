    original changes—comes naturally from the vector way of thinking about graphics.
    You might say that a clone is not a real object—rather, it is just a command:
    “Display a copy of the object here.” The document stores that command, not an
    actual copy of the object. An actual cloned object exists only in the memory of
    an SVG application such as Inkscape when it loads the document.'

- en: There are both artistic and technical reasons to use clones. Watching several
    objects change live when you edit only one is in itself an exciting experience,
    opening many creative possibilities. On the other hand, using clones instead of
    duplicates makes the SVG document smaller and faster to display. Map symbols,
    repeated design elements such as bullets or icons, various symmetric designs or
    patterns—all these are easy to do with clones. Few other vector editors allow
    you to create live linked copies of objects with such directness and ease as Inkscape.

    of a path ([Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Editing Paths")) or a shape ([Chapter 11](ch11.html
    "Chapter 11. Shapes")), then it exactly reproduces the form of the original, and
    it updates automatically when you edit the original in the Node tool or in a shape
    tool. If it is a clone of the text, it has the same textual content and is also
    updated live when you edit the original with the Text tool. Finally, if you clone
    a group, you can then enter that group (**[5.10 Selecting in Groups](ch05s10.html
    "5.10 Selecting in Groups")**) to add, delete, or edit objects within the group—and
    the group’s clone will update immediately. On the other hand, since a clone has
    no content of its own, you cannot edit its content—no node editing, text editing,
    or ungrouping is possible on a clone so long as it remains a clone.

    This works pretty intuitively and is generally convenient; this way, for example,
    you can take the original of a large pattern of clones and move it away without
    disturbing the pattern. You can also grab both the original and its clones and

    flips in various combinations. However, all of these symmetries use the same rectangular
    grid placement as P1, with the width and height of the unit of grid being the
    same as width and height of the original object.

    patterns. The P4M symmetry results in partial overlapping of rectangular tiles;
    with it, use triangular tiles to avoid overlapping and fill the plane ([Figure 16-15](ch16s06.html#symmetries_with_90-degree_rotations

    in appearance. Again, P31M creates a more dense pattern with partially overlapping
    tiles, so you can use a “pie slice” shape to fill the plane with this symmetry
    without overlapping.

    patterns. Of them, P6M again overlaps the tiles and requires a “pie slice” shape
    to fill the plane without overlapping.

    trick may be useful: Create the pattern and then scale the original down. This
    will make the pattern more sparse, and its characterisic logic will be easier
    to understand.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When working on a tessellation (a pattern that completely fills the plane without
    gaps or overlapping), it would be very difficult to create a tile of the proper
    shape in isolation, even if you understand well how your chosen symmetry works.
    Instead, just start with any random shape, create the pattern from it using the
    desired symmetry, and then node-edit the original path watching how the pattern’s
    clones repeat its changes. In this way, a surprisingly sophisticated tessellation
    can be produced very quickly (see **[24.2 Treatment 2: Tessellation](ch24s02.html
    "24.2 Treatment 2: Tessellation")**).'

    to be applied to the pattern’s tiles—that is, transforms on top of those shifts,
    rotations, and flips implied by the chosen symmetry group.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these additional transform components can be specified separately per
    row and per column, and each value can include a degree of randomness. You can
    specify, for example, an equivalent of “Make tiles in each next row 20 percent
    taller, rotate tiles in each next column by 5 degrees, and make the rotation angle
    vary randomly by 50 percent.” All shifts, scales, and randomization values are
    measured as percentages of the original object’s dimensions.

    easily create a flower or a clock face:'

- en: You can make the values **Alternate** (for example, scale clones in every second
    row). The **Cumulate** checkbox forces the values of shift or scale to accumulate;
    for example, normally a shift of 10 px per column means that each column is shifted
    by 10 px relative to the previous column. If you check **Cumulate**, the same
    value would mean every column being shifted 10 px further than was its predecessor—that
    is, the second column is 10 px from the first, the third is 20 px from the second,
    and so on.

- en: 'For complex symmetries, a natural question is: What should be considered a
    “row” and a “column” when calculating transform values? Inkscape draws complex
    patterns by symmetric clusters (of 3, 4, 6, or 12 clones, depending on the symmetry),
    going from one cluster to the next horizontally within a row. In other words,
    clones that belong to one cluster are considered to be in the same row but in
    different columns. This means that the **Per row** shift values work by shifting
    rows of clusters or scaling clones in each cluster uniformly, whereas **Per column**
    values affect each clone independently, and as a result clusters lose their symmetry.
    If you want to space out symmetric clusters in both dimensions, just create a
    single cluster with your chosen symmetry, then group it, and tile the group with
    a simple P1 symmetry, possibly with alternating shifts.'

    you can adjust the blur and the opacity (the **Fade out** value) of the clones
    in the pattern, per row or per column, with optional alternating or randomization.
    Remember that you can only make a clone more blurred or more transparent than
    its original, but not less.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we’ve seen in **[16.3 Styling Clones](ch16s03.html "16.3 Styling Clones")**,
    if you want to paint a clone with its own color, you need to unset the corresponding
    property in the original. Once you’ve done that for the paint you’re going to
    change (fill, stroke, or both), the **Create Tiled Clones** dialog allows you
    to create a wide variety of color patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Color** tab of the dialog looks very similar to all the tabs we already
    know. Here, you can vary any of the three components of the clone color in the
    HSL model—hue, saturation, and lightness (**[8.2.3 HSL](ch08s02.html#eightdot2dot3_hsl
    "8.2.3 HSL")**)—per row or per column, as well as alternate or randomize the changes.
    You also need to specify the **Initial color** from which all these variations
    will start; just click the color swatch and use the color selector dialog. Remember
    that the original must have unset fill or stroke, otherwise this tab will have
    no effect!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last tab of the **Create Tiled Clones** dialog ([Figure 16-25](ch16s06.html#trace_tab
    "Figure 16-25. The Trace tab")) is quite different from the rest. Here, you can
    make the pattern *trace* any kind of image on top of which it is built—that is,
    make it so that some of the aspects of each clone will depend on what is below
    it. The background image you’re tracing can be anything—for example, you can cover
    with the pattern an imported bitmap such as a photo, or you can draw anything
    with vector objects; it makes no difference to the tracer what it picks its values
    from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tab contains three main areas that correspond to the three main steps of
    the tracing algorithm. First, you pick some value at the location of each clone;
    second, you do some optional processing with that value; and third, you apply
    the result to some aspect of the clone. Enable the controls of the tab by checking
    the **Trace the drawing under the tiles** checkbox.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the input value, you have the option of picking the **Color**, **Opacity**,
    or any single component of the color in RGB or HSL models. The value you pick
    for each clone is averaged over the entire rectangular area that will be covered
    by that clone’s bounding box. Of these options, all produce a single numeric value
    in the range from 0 to 1, except **Color**, which picks all three components of
    the color as a composite value.

- en: Finally, the resulting value can be applied to the clone’s probability of presence
    (0 translates into absence of the clone at this location, 1 into presence, and
    intermediate values make it appear with this given probability); color (this can
    directly reuse the background color if it was picked; otherwise, it translates
    single values to shades of gray), size (from disappearance at 0 to its full size
    at 1), and opacity (smaller values make the clone more transparent). Any number
    of these options can be enabled at the same time; for example, you can pick lightness,
    invert it, and apply it to both the opacity and size of the clones (see Figure
    12 on the color insert).
