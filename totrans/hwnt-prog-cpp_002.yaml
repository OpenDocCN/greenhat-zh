    notice that the machine was malfunctioning and traced the problem to a moth that
    had flown into the machine and gotten beaten to death by the relay contacts.

    a bug in the system." Thus, the first computer bug. ^([[1](#ftn.N23)])'

- en: My introduction to computer bugs came long after this. I wrote my first program
    at age 11\. It was one assembly language instruction long. The program added together
    2 + 2\. The result was 2\. The program was only one instruction long and it still
    had a bug in it.

    book, "[Hello World](LiB0005.html#7)."'

- en: Before the days of ATMs you had to go to the bank and manually make a deposit.
    Usually you would use one of the preprinted deposit slips found in the back of
    your checkbook. These came with your account number written in magnetic ink on
    the bottom of the slip.

- en: If you ran out of slips, the bank would provide you with one. It had no number
    written at the bottom, so when it was processed using the bank's automatic machinery,
    so the machine kicked it out and a clerk manually entered the account number.

    like the normal "generic" deposit slip, except that the crook's account number
    was printed in magnetic ink at the bottom.

- en: 'The scam worked this way: A customer entered the bank to make a deposit and
    got one of the doctored slips. He filled it out and made a deposit. Since the
    slip contains an account number, the computer automatically processed it and made
    a deposit into the account written on the bottom. Ignored was the handwritten
    account number on the slip. In other words, our crook was hijacking deposits.'

- en: A detective assigned to the case was baffled. Deposits were disappearing and
    no one knew how. He narrowed it down to deposits made in the bank. He decided
    to try and make a large number of deposits and see what would happen. Since he
    was using his own money, the deposits would have to be very small. Very very small.
    In fact they were for 6¢ each.

- en: The detective spent a week making deposits. He would go to the bank, fill out
    a slip, get in line, make a deposit for 6¢, fill out a new slip, get in line,
    make a deposit for 6¢, and so on. The clerks thought he was crazy. One day, one
    of his deposits disappeared. So he had the bank search its records to see if anyone
    else had made a 6¢ deposit that day. Someone had, and the crook was caught.

    *bug* in conjunction to *computing machine* it was not. The term bug had been
    around for a long time before that to describe all sorts of machinery faults.
    But why let the truth spoil a good story?
