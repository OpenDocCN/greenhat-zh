    Now anyone with a little bit of recording gear and an Internet connection
    can create an audio broadcast to share with the world. You can tell
    stories, report news, and share how-tos. Your podcast can be just you
    talking, you interviewing another person, you and a cohost, or you and a
    gaggle of cohosts and guests. You can add a music track or special
    effects. Making podcasts with Audacity is easy and fun.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Once you have created your masterpiece, you need a website to host
    it and make it available to your eager audience. The Internet is full of
    free and inexpensive podcast hosts. If you have enough bandwidth and want
    to be your own server admin, you can be your own host thanks to the
    multitudes of free and open source streaming server software.</p><p>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>podcast</em></span> used to refer to downloadable
    MP3-encoded recordings for iPods. Apple made a brief, ferocious attempt to
    own the word <span class="emphasis"><em>pod</em></span> and sicced lawyers on a number of
    small businesses who dared to use the word, such as TightPod
    (laptop-protecting covers), Profit Pod (data collector for vending
    machines), Spodradio (a German online broadcaster), and Podcast Ready
    (another online broadcaster). Fortunately, it seems that the attack
    lawyers have moved on to something else, and it is safe to say “pod”
    again. So, that is what we are going to do: pea pod, pod of whales, pod
    people. Open the pod bay door, Hal.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Audacity is a dandy tool for making podcasts. You can use a digital
    recorder and then dump the recording into Audacity for editing, or you can
    record directly into a computer. A USB microphone or headset connected to
    a netbook makes a great lightweight portable recording studio. Or, you may
    indulge in using an entire studio full of fancy expensive gear; it’s
    entirely up to you.</p><p>Up until now in this book I’ve been nattering on about high-quality
    audio and not using lossy, compressed audio file formats. With podcasts
    we’re going the other way: smaller file sizes and lossy, compressed
    formats. You still want to start with creating a high-quality master, but
    it’s not necessary to treat your podcast the same way as an ultimate
    audiophile music recording, because it is going to be trimmed down for
    Internet streaming and fast downloads.</p><p>You may want to review <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap">Chapter 2</a> first to learn the
    fundamentals of using Audacity and how to set up your recording
    gear.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Short Story"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_short_story"/>The Short Story</h1></div></div></div><p>Making a simple podcast takes just a few steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Make your recording.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Edit it in Audacity: trim, repair, normalize—the usual

      podcast.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Audio terminology is a bit confused when it comes to defining
        track. Track can be a single mono track, a stereo track, and even a
        sound track. In Audacity, it is helpful to think of a track as any
        single editable unit, which is any mono track or stereo track. Any
        edits that you make, such as deletions, additions, special effects,
        and so on, will be applied equally to the left and right channels in
        an Audacity stereo track.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Making a Simple Voicecast"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="making_a_simple_voicecast"/>Making a Simple Voicecast</h1></div></div></div><p>The simplest podcast is just you talking. As simple as this
      sounds, speaking into a microphone takes a bit of practice. You might
      practice speaking into a microphone without creating unwanted noises
      such as smacks, pops, loud breathing, clicking dentures, or any other
      unpleasant sounds. Beware verbal ticks like “uh, um, you know.” Practice
      gauging the optimal distance between your mouth and the microphone, and
      set it up so that you can stand or sit comfortably. Using a mic stand is
      better than hand-holding, and if you’re using a lavalier mic, clip it
      where your clothing won’t rub on it. I prefer a good-quality USB
      headset. Speak past the mic as though you have an audience in the room,
      rather than into the mic; this will help you energize your voice and
      project it in a way that will reduce unwanted side effects. A windscreen
      or a foam windsock is essential.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>How fast should you speak? This depends on your personality and
      the type of material. Usually 120 words per minute is cited as a good
      rate, though it will feel slow to most English speakers. This doesn’t
      necessarily mean a speed limit of two words per second, but it means
      relaxing and using carefully timed pauses to allow listeners a chance to
      absorb what you’re saying.</p><p>I use a Plantronics stereo USB headset for voice recordings (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#a_good_usb_headset_is_a_great_tool_for_m" title="Figure 7-1. A good USB headset is a great tool for making voice recordings.">Figure 7-1</a>). It’s comfortable
      and easy to use, and the sound quality is good. USB recording interfaces
      have their own analog-to-digital converters, so you don’t need a sound
      card. They also eliminate the risk of picking up internal computer
      noise, which is sometimes a problem with internal sound cards.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_good_usb_headset_is_a_great_tool_for_m"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e9898"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797589.png.jpg" alt="A good USB headset is a great tool for making voice recordings."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-1. A good USB headset is a great tool for making voice
        recordings.</p></div><p>It takes a lot of practice to speak well without a script or
      rehearsing, so don’t feel bad if you need them. It’s better to make as
      clean a recording as possible than to clean up a recording all full of
      bad stuff, and your listeners will appreciate a crisp, focused
      presentation.</p><div class="sect2" title="Audacity Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="audacity_settings-id1"/>Audacity Settings</h2></div></div></div><p>First create a new Audacity project with <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Save

        however many you are recording at one time. If it is just you with a
        mono microphone, set one channel. If you are using a stereo mic or
        headset, that is two. Beware of cheapo onboard sound chips, like the
        ones used in laptops—the microphone input is often mono even if they
        claim it’s stereo.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Quality</strong></span> dialog, set a default sample rate of
        44,100 and a default sample format (which is really <span class="emphasis"><em>bit
        depth</em></span>; Audacity has a few terminology quirks) of 32-bit
        float. (See <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> for more
        information on bit depths and sampling rates.) You can record at a
        higher audio resolution if you prefer, but for a simple voicecast,
        those extra bits aren’t going to make any difference. In fact, you
        could use 16/44.1. It saves disk space, sounds good, and exports to
        lower-quality formats like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis just fine.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Now go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Recording</strong></span> dialog, make sure that “Overdub:
        Play other tracks while recording new one” and “Software Play-through:
        Listen while recording or monitoring new track” are not
        checked.</p><p>Leave the Preferences menu and click the Input Level Meter to
        start monitoring and to set your recording level (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#setting_the_recording_level" title="Figure 7-2. Setting the recording level">Figure 7-2</a>). This might take a bit of
        trial and error, depending on how much variation there is in your
        voice. Record to a peak of -9 or -12 dB to give yourself a good safety
        margin, and you’ll still have a very good signal-to-noise ratio. Never
        go over zero; that results in clipping, which creates distortion. The
        blue lines mark the highest peak for the session, and the red lines
        mark the highest peak in the last three seconds. The dark red bars
        indicate peak levels, and the light red bars show the average
        amplitude.</p><div class="figure"><a id="setting_the_recording_level"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e9990"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797591.png.jpg" alt="Setting the recording level"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-2. Setting the recording level</p></div><p>Most USB headsets come with Windows software that lets you
        control both the input and output volumes. Linux users may have to
        rely on ALSA (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a>) to set the
        volume levels. The Audacity Mixer toolbar (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#the_audacity_mixer_toolbar" title="Figure 7-3. The Audacity Mixer toolbar">Figure 7-3</a>) works with audio interfaces
        if their drivers support volume controls. Many don’t. This is why I

        clean up your recording. First, delete anything you don’t want to
        keep; just do a rough cut on your first pass and leave a bit extra.
        You can always delete more, but you can’t put back very easily. If you
        have more than one track, be mindful of keeping them synchronized
        (though if they do get out of sync, there are simple ways to get them
        back together).</p><p>Then select <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Show Clipping</strong></span> to highlight in red
        any clipped segments. If you find some, there are a number of ways to
        fix them.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0019" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If it is a very brief clip, less than a quarter second in
        duration, zoom in until you can precisely select the clipped part and
        delete it. When it’s a fraction of a second, no one will
        notice.</p><div class="figure"><a id="at_last_comma_weare_making_our_recording"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10063"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797595.png.jpg" alt="At last, we’re making our recording!"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-4. At last, we’re making our recording!</p></div><p>Another way is to re-record the clipped segment at the correct
        recording level in a second track or Audacity window and then copy
        that over the clipped segment. It’s not easy to replace a short
        segment surgically, so you might select a longer section to replace.
        Look for natural breaks so you can patch the new part in gracefully,
        as in <a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#making_a_smoother_patch_by_selecting_a_s" title="Figure 7-5. Making a smoother patch by selecting a segment to replace at natural breaks">Figure 7-5</a>. The

        seconds long, even though the clipped portion (indicated by the three
        vertical peaks between the six-second mark and the
        six-and-a-half–second marks) is less than a half second in
        duration.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="making_a_smoother_patch_by_selecting_a_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10087"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797597.png.jpg" alt="Making a smoother patch by selecting a segment to replace at natural breaks"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-5. Making a smoother patch by selecting a segment to replace at
          natural breaks</p></div><p>Now here is a cool trick that I like because it helps me keep
        track of where I am editing. If you have used Audacity very much, you
        know that a slip of the mouse or accidentally hitting a hotkey will
        lose your place, and if it’s a long track, it’s a pain to get back to
        where you where. So, don’t delete your selection but instead use
        <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Split Delete</strong></span>. This replaces the selection
        with an empty gap, as in <a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#using_edit_g_split_delete_to_leave_a_gap" title="Figure 7-6. Using Edit &gt; Split Delete to leave a gap marking your deletion">Figure 7-6</a>. This also keeps
        your track at the same length, which you might want if you have two or
        more tracks to keep synchronized.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0027" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="using_edit_g_split_delete_to_leave_a_gap"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10134"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797599.png.jpg" alt="Using Edit &gt; Split Delete to leave a gap marking your deletion"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-6. Using <span class="strong">Edit</span> &gt; <span class="strong">Split Delete</span> to leave a gap marking your
          deletion</p></div><p>Now you can go ahead and make your rerecording. Don’t worry
        about making the recording levels exactly the same as in your original
        project because that is easy to adjust with <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span>. When it is satisfactory, with nary a
        belch, bump, or cough, copy it and paste it into the gap (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#paste_the_new_segment_into_the_gap_you_l" title="Figure 7-7. Paste the new segment into the gap you left when you deleted the bad bit.">Figure 7-7</a>). The edges may
        not exactly match, but we can fix that.</p><div class="figure"><a id="paste_the_new_segment_into_the_gap_you_l"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10152"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797601.png.jpg" alt="Paste the new segment into the gap you left when you deleted the bad bit."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-7. Paste the new segment into the gap you left when you deleted
          the bad bit.</p></div><p>There are a number of ways to deal with the empty parts on
        either side of the new segment. The simplest is to delete them. If you
        don’t want to shorten the track, use <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Silence</strong></span> to fill the gaps.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0028" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another way is to use the Time Shift tool to move everything
        together. The edges will match exactly when you see the Snap Guide
        appear, which is a yellow vertical line that appears when borders are
        perfectly lined up. Click to mark the place where the borders join,
        and then zoom way in until you can use the Repair effect to smooth
        over the edge of your patch. This operates on a maximum sample size of
        128 samples, so zoom way in until you can make a selection that small.
        The Zoom tool centers on wherever you click. Then click <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Repair</strong></span>, which uses interpolation to make a
        seamless join.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One more fun Audacity trick for stretching out a patch is to use
        <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Change Tempo</strong></span> to slow down your patch without
        changing the pitch. You can measure the exact length required by
        selecting the “Length” radio button in the Selection toolbar and then
        make a selection from the beginning of your patch to the end of the
        gap. The yellow Snap Guides will appear when you are exactly on your
        borders. The example in <a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#figuring_out_how_long_your_patch_needs_t" title="Figure 7-8. Figuring out how long your patch needs to be">Figure 7-8</a> needs to be 60

        your waveform (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#the_portion_from_2.7_to_3_seconds_is_too" title="Figure 7-10. The portion from 2.7 to 3 seconds is too loud.">Figure 7-10</a>, at 2.7 to 3
        seconds), even if they aren’t clipped, and review them to decide
        whether they need to be reduced. In this example, I was speaking too
        loudly from the excitement of making a podcast, so I used <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span> to reduce the amplitude. Yes, it says
        “amplify,” but if you give it a negative value (such as -3 or -6 dB),
        it will attenuate.</p><p>You can use trial and error to figure out how much reduction in
        volume to apply, or you can use the Waveform (db) view to get an idea
        of how much you need. Change the waveform display to Waveform (db) in
        the Track menu (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#changing_the_waveform_display_to_wavefor" title="Figure 7-11. Changing the waveform display to Waveform (dB)">Figure 7-11</a>), and then
        expand the width of the track (grab the border with the mouse and
        pull) until you see the decibel scale on the left (<a class="xref" href="ch07s02.html#this_selection_could_be_as_many_as_12_de" title="Figure 7-12. This selection could be as many as 12 decibels too loud.">Figure 7-12</a>). In this
        example, it looks like the loud part could be as many as 12 decibels

      to a compressed lossy format, either Ogg Vorbis or MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio
      Layer 3, not MPEG-3). (Refer to <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 14</a> to learn how to
      enable MP3 support on Linux and Windows.)</p><p>MP3 is the universal portable digital audio format: Everything
      supports MP3. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a>, there are differences
      between Ogg Vorbis and MP3. Some listeners claim that Ogg Vorbis
      delivers higher quality than MP3. At low bitrates, neither one sounds
      very good to me; rather, they sound flat and without character or depth.
      At higher bitrates, both sound acceptable, though I think Ogg delivers a
      more accurate, natural sound. MP3s sound a bit too-bright and
      crunchy.</p><p>Ogg Vorbis supports multichannel surround, while MP3 supports one
      or two channels. MP3 is encumbered by patents held by several different
      patent holders in different countries, and the last one expires on 2017.
      Does this mean you’ll get a visit from attack lawyers if you distribute
      your work in MP3 format? I don’t know. It seems that a lot of artists
      distribute their work as MP3s without paying license fees and don’t get
      in trouble. Ask a lawyer who specializes in these issues.</p><p>Even if your listeners all have megamondo broadband, it’s a good
      practice to maintain a frugal attitude. And they don’t all have fat
      pipes; estimates of US dial-up users range from 25 to 45 percent. Don’t
      forget that the Internet is international, so your potential audience
      includes countries that rely on dial-up and low-speed wireless. Even for
      broadband users, network congestion and queuing gum up streaming media,
      so the moral is that streaming audio is still more reliable at lower
      bitrates.</p><p>As always, there are trade-offs. If your podcast host allows it,
      you can offer your listeners a choice of listening options at different
      quality levels and both streaming and downloadable files.</p><div class="sect2" title="Ogg Vorbis Quality Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ogg_vorbis_quality_settings"/>Ogg Vorbis Quality Settings</h2></div></div></div><p>Ogg exports are easy in Audacity. You might have read how-tos
        that say to use a variable bitrate (vbr) rather than a constant
        bitrate (cbr). Although this is good advice, it is unnecessary because
        Ogg Vorbis does not support cbr. Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; Save as type: Ogg Vorbis Files,

        bitrate, and more complex passages will have a higher bitrate. This
        delivers better quality than a fixed bitrate. You won’t be able to
        calculate file sizes precisely, but the fine folks who invented Ogg
        Vorbis don’t think much of measuring quality by bitrates anyway. To
        give a basis for comparison, a quality setting of 3 results in an
        average bitrate of around 112Kbps, and Ogg fans claim it sounds better
        than a 128Kbps MP3.</p><p>Ogg Vorbis uses <span class="emphasis"><em>lossy channel coupling</em></span> up
        to level 5. Redundancies between the left and right channels are
        combined to save space. This might affect the stereo imaging, so if
        this bothers you, use a quality setting of 6 or higher because channel
        coupling is turned off at this level. I use 6. My ears can’t tell the
        difference between 7 and up. Your ears, of course, may tell you a
        different story.</p><p>For a simple voicecast, you can go all the way down to 0, and it

        your own ears tell you differently).<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0066" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0067" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In Audacity you have four categories for setting the MP3
        bitrate: Preset, Variable, Average, and Constant.</p><p>Preset gives you four different prefab combinations that are
        recommended by the LAME developers: Medium, Standard, Extreme, and
        Insane. Standard is fine for music, but you can go lower for a simple
        voicecast. Medium, Standard, and Extreme all use <span class="emphasis"><em>variable
        bitrates (vbr)</em></span>. Variable bitrate means the bitrate varies
        according to the complexity of the sounds, which results in better
        audio quality. In the olden days, variable bitrates gave MP3 players
        fits because they were designed for <span class="emphasis"><em>constant bitrates
        (cbr)</em></span>. But that was a long time ago, and these days
        variable bitrates shouldn’t present any problems. Variable bitrates
        are always defined within a range, like the 170Kbps to 210Kbps of the
        Standard preset.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0068" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Insane uses the maximum constant bitrate, 320Kbps. In my
        experience, the Standard setting (170Kbps to 210Kbps) is about as good
        as MP3 can deliver, and anything over that doesn’t make a noticeable
        difference.</p><p>Variable has a range of 10 quality settings. Quality setting 5
        is 110Kbps to 150Kbps, which is fine for simple voicecasts.</p><p>Average is, in my opinion, not worth bothering with. It is a
        compromise between Variable and Constant bitrates. You set a constant
        bitrate, but since it’s an average, a little bit of fluctuation is
        allowed. So the quality is not quite as good as Variable, and it’s a
        little better than Constant bitrate.</p><p>Constant bitrates are supposed to work better for streaming
        audio over the Internet, and you get a predictable file size. If you
        want to use constant bitrates, Audacity gives you a full range to
        choose from.</p><p>Set Variable Speed: Standard. Standard gives better quality, and
        it takes a tiny bit longer to encode.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#audacity_supports_a_wide_range_of_mp3_bi" title="Figure 7-15. Audacity supports a wide range of MP3 bitrates.">Figure 7-15</a> and

        storage space to even think of using Joint Stereo. If you are
        desperate for storage space, to the point that you’re thinking of
        encoding your MP3 files at a bitrate of 112Kbps or lower, then give it
        a try. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>joint stereo</em></span> is a poor name that
        does not describe what it does. A popular misconception is that it
        joins the two stereo channels and destroys the stereo separation. As
        always with audio engineering, it’s more complex than that. Here is a
        new audio term for you: <span class="emphasis"><em>human psychoacoustics</em></span>.
        Isn’t that a splendid phrase? No, it doesn’t mean psycho like a crazy
        person with a big knife, sorry. It means engineering audio in a way
        that takes into account how the human ear perceives sounds, instead of
        adhering to a strictly mathematical model, which does not correspond
        to how human hearing really works. It is quite sophisticated, and if
        you don’t like the way joint stereo sounds, it’s easy enough to do
        over.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0069" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0070" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0071" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="audacity_supports_a_wide_range_of_mp3_bi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10588"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797617.png.jpg" alt="Audacity supports a wide range of MP3 bitrates."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-15. Audacity supports a wide range of MP3 bitrates.</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="audacity_offers_a_range_of_mp3_quality_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10596"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797619.png.jpg" alt="Audacity offers a range of MP3 quality settings and presets."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-16. Audacity offers a range of MP3 quality settings and

        means using any of several techniques to reduce bitrate while
        preserving an acceptable level of quality by merging redundancies in
        the left and right channels. These “redundancies” are frequencies that
        the human perceives as less directional, which are the upper
        frequencies. It should improve how recordings at low bitrates sound
        because more audio data are preserved at the expense of stereo
        imaging.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0072" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="mp3s_comma_encoders_comma_and_other_audi"/><p class="title">MP3s, Encoders, and Other Audio Formats</p><p>LAME stands for “LAME Ain’t an MP3 Encoder.” In its early

        Pan slider to adjust the relative volume of the left and right
        channels. These adjustments do not change the project file; you will
        hear the changes in playback in Audacity and in your final export, but
        your Audacity project files will not be altered. The Mixer Board
        controls are all or nothing; they apply to the whole track and can’t
        be applied only to sections of the track.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0093" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0094" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0095" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0096" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_mixer_board"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10781"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797625.png.jpg" alt="The Mixer Board"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-19. The Mixer Board</p></div><p>This is pretty easy, and if you want more control, you can split

          <span class="emphasis"><em>vocals</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>piano</em></span>, and even

        each track separately, making the usual fixes and matching the volume
        of your two speakers as well as you can. By default, Audacity plays
        all tracks at the same time when you hit Play. Look on the Mixer Board
        for the Mute and Solo buttons to control which ones you want to hear.
        Solo automatically mutes all tracks except the one you want to hear;
        Mute silences one track at a time.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0098" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0099" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0100" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0101" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0102" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0103" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0104" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0105" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If your two people talk at the same time, you can separate them
        by adding silence. For example, if there is five seconds of overlap
        where they are both yakking at once, add five seconds of silence to
        one track to push them apart. Position the cursor where you want the
        silence to begin, click <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span>
        &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Silence</strong></span>, and enter how many
        seconds of silence you want. You may have to do this several times on
        both tracks to keep them lined up, especially after making
        changes.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0106" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When you have everything cleaned up and ready to export, rejoin
        your tracks by using the Track menu in the upper track and clicking
        <span class="strong"><strong>Make Stereo Track</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Adding a Background Music Track"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="adding_a_background_music_track"/>Adding a Background Music Track</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that you’re aces at producing multitrack podcasts, adding a
      music track is as easy as falling over. Just like when you make a solo
      podcast, your soundtrack should be in a two-channel stereo track even if
      it is a mono recording. Then your listeners will hear music in both
      channels. You can create a two-channel track from a mono track by
      copying the track, pasting the copy below the original, and selecting
      <span class="strong"><strong>Make Stereo Track</strong></span> from the upper
      track’s Track menu.</p><p>You can add a music file to your podcast project by opening the
      <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span> dialog or by copying and pasting from
      another Audacity project.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0107" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can adjust the music volume with the Gain slider. Remember,
      the Gain slider does not alter your project file, so it’s a quick way to
      tune your mix without making a lot of changes that might mess up your
      project for future editing. Another option is to use the Envelope tool
      to vary it from pleasant background to thrilling crescendo. The Envelope
      tool does change the project file.</p><p>There is an even cooler way to manage the volume on your
      background music track, and that is with <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Auto
      Duck</strong></span>. This is perfect for recordings with a background music
      track because it automatically lowers the volume when the foreground
      track cuts in and raises it when the foreground cuts out. In <a class="xref" href="ch07s05.html#to_use_auto_duck_comma_your_background_t" title="Figure 7-21. To use Auto Duck, your background track must be on top and the foreground, or control track, underneath.">Figure 7-21</a> we see the setup:
      A background music track is on top, and the bottom track is the voice
      track. When the voices start, I want the music volume to decrease, and
      when the voices stop, the music should get louder. The tracks have to be
      in this order: the background track on top and the foreground, or
      <span class="emphasis"><em>control track</em></span>, underneath.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0108" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="to_use_auto_duck_comma_your_background_t"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10926"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797629.png.jpg" alt="To use Auto Duck, your background track must be on top and the foreground, or control track, underneath."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-21. To use Auto Duck, your background track must be on top and the

      settings I like to use. These settings create a fast fade-out and a
      gradual fade-in. The background track ducks out of the way fast and
      gracefully glides slowly back in with just a little bit of overlap with
      the voice track.</p><div class="figure"><a id="my_suggested_auto_duck_settings_for_a_fa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e10944"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797631.png.jpg" alt="My suggested Auto Duck settings for a fast fade-out and slow fade-in"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-22. My suggested Auto Duck settings for a fast fade-out and slow

      background track.</p><p>Maximum Pause determines how long the total fade-in and outs will
      take. The values for Outer fade down length and Outer fade up length
      cannot total more than the maximum pause.</p><p>The Outer fade down length setting determines how quickly the
      background track will fade before the voice on the control track comes
      back. Anything outside the two vertical lines happens when the control
      track is below your threshold. The Inner fade down length setting
      determines how much overlap there will be with the control track.</p><p>The Outer fade up length setting sets how fast the backing track
      fades back in when the voice on the control track stops, and the Inner
      fade up length setting controls the overlap. A half second of gently
      rising music over the voice isn’t a lot; I think it makes a nice bit of
      a transition.</p><p>The Threshold setting controls the sound level for triggering the
      Auto Duck effect.</p><p>When you are finished, you need to mix and render your tracks
      together into a single stereo track. If you press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">shift</span>-M,
      this mixes your project down into a new stereo track underneath your
      original tracks. This is how I prefer to mixdown because it saves my
      original tracks, and then I copy the new stereo track into a new
      Audacity project for final tweaks and exports. If you use <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Mix and
      Render</strong></span> instead, your original tracks are replaced by the new
      stereo track.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0112" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Sometimes combining multiple tracks makes them too loud, so undo
      Mix and Render (<span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-Z or <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span>) and use the Gain controls to turn them
      down a bit. Then export again. (When you have odd problems with track
      volume, such as unbalanced sound, check your Gain sliders.)</p><p>Now your podcast with its background music track is ready for
      export.</p><p>Visit <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects">Chapter 11</a> to
