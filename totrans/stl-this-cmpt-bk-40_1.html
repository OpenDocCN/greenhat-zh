The point is that being a hacker doesn't necessarily make you a criminal. Your attitude makes you a hacker, but if you're not careful, your actions can make you a criminal.</p><p>With the news media ready to blame every computer glitch on malicious hackers, too many people get a one-sided point of view that hackers are just completely evil, bent-on-destruction-of-the-civilized-world malcontents who'd love nothing better than to demolish everything good in society and sow terror and chaos in their wake. (Of course, that's the same one-sided view used to slander some people as "terrorists" or "insurgents" while others call those exact same people "freedom fighters" and "patriots," but that's a subject for <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Hate Groups and Terrorists on the Internet">Chapter 17</a>.)</p><p>Whether a hacker fits the stereotypical image of a nerd with pocket protectors, thick glasses, and awkward social skills is irrelevant (and most don't). A hacker is not defined by how he looks or behaves, but rather by how he thinks, and the most crucial aspect in developing a true hacker mentality is learning how to think for yourself.</p><div class="sect1" title="Questioning Authority"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="questioning_authority"/>Questioning Authority</h1></div></div></div><p>To truly start thinking for yourself, begin by questioning authority. This doesn't mean rebelling against, overthrowing, or ignoring authority. It means listening to what any authority figure or organization tells you and discerning their motives. As every con artist knows, the first step to getting someone to do what you want is to hide your own motives and pretend that you really want to help them instead. (See <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. The Internet Con Artists">Chapter 13</a> for more information about how con games work over the Internet.) Questioning authority means nothing more than asking how the authority figure or organization will benefit if you do what they tell you to do.</p><p>There are three possible reasons an authority figure or organization would tell you something:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It really is for your own good.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It's all they know at the moment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It's really for their benefit, not yours.</p></li></ul></div><p>Parents tell children to eat their vegetables not because they want to torture their kids or make them miserable, but because eating a balanced diet is actually good for kids, no matter how distasteful they may find broccoli or spinach to be. Similarly, governments tell their citizens how to survive natural disasters or avoid trouble while traveling in foreign countries because that information really can help people survive. Parents may benefit by having healthier kids and saving money buying carrots and celery instead of hamburgers and french fries, but financial motives are secondary to their children's health. Similarly, governments may benefit from having live taxpayers rather than dead citizens, but that's secondary to the real motive of basic public safety. More often than many people might like to admit, authority figures and organizations do have your best interests at heart, which is why blindly rebelling against all forms of authority is ultimately as counterproductive as ignoring traffic lights to protest government interference and then getting hurt—or hurting someone else—when you crash your car.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, authority figures and organizations don't always have such pure, altruistic motives at heart. That's why it's important to question authority. Many times, the authorities really don't know what they're doing. If you follow their orders without question, you're the one who will suffer any consequences, not them.</p><p>When the United States government exposed Army soldiers to atomic bomb blasts in the 1950s, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#to_avoid_looking_directly_at_an_atomic_b" title="Figure 1-1. To avoid looking directly at an atomic bomb blast, US soldiers cover their faces with their hands. This is the same position government authorities will later use to avoid looking directly at these veterans while refusing to grant compensation for illnesses suffered as a result of excessive radiation exposure.">Figure 1-1</a>, they didn't intend for the soldiers to get hit by radiation so they could later die of leukemia. At the time, the government wanted to study the effects of atomic bomb blasts among conventional military forces, so they took all the precautions they believed necessary to protect the solders' welfare. In this case, the government's actions were born out of ignorance. However, the subsequent decision to hide the problematic test results and avoid responsibility for the soldiers' health falls more under the category of malicious self-interest. Ignorance can be forgiven only when combined with accountability, and that's something few authorities will ever take upon themselves. You should always question not only what anyone in authority wants you to do, but why they should have any authority over you in the first place.</p><p>More frightening is when authorities act purely for their own benefit while stealing, injuring, or killing the rest of us. Dictatorships throughout history, in countries such as China, Germany, Afghanistan, North Korea, Iraq, Zimbabwe, Japan, Iran, Cuba, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, have routinely executed or imprisoned anyone who questioned their authority. Under such dictatorships, the citizens are supposed to do all the work while the authorities enjoy all the money (which is something most Americans can empathize with when income tax time rolls around April 15, just before Congress votes itself another pay raise and takes one of its many recesses).<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Such blatant abuses of authority are perpetrated by individuals and corporations as well as by governments. For instance, consider Jim Jones, who founded the People's Temple as an urban Christian mission that offered free meals, beds to sleep in, and even jobs, along with a sense of community. In San Francisco, where the group settled, city officials such as Mayor George Moscone, Supervisor Harvey Milk, and Assemblyman Willie Brown supported Jones (in return for the support of the People's Temple at election time). Even newspapers, including the <span class="emphasis"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></span>, praised Jones and his People's Temple for setting up drug treatment clinics, child care services, and senior citizen programs.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Such benevolent actions masked the megalomania of Jim Jones, who ultimately led his church to Guyana, where he physically and emotionally abused his followers before ordering them to commit mass suicide by drinking cyanide-laced fruit punch.</p><div class="figure"><a id="to_avoid_looking_directly_at_an_atomic_b"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e508"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676457.png.jpg" alt="To avoid looking directly at an atomic bomb blast, US soldiers cover their faces with their hands.

The United States may feel justified in using military force to promote democracy in Iraq, but it has yet to send in the Marines to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia. Islamic radicals may claim they're fighting pro-Western dictatorships in the Middle East, but they're still blowing up innocent Muslim women and children with their car bombs. Mother Teresa may have had her critics, but none of them can deny that she tried to do good. Jim Jones had his supporters, but none of them can deny that he deliberately did something bad.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Too often, good actions can mask bad intentions. That's why you need to question authority. If you don't, you may become part of the problem, or as the American legal system likes to put it, "an accessory to the crime."</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Questioning Assumptions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="questioning_assumptions"/>Questioning Assumptions</h1></div></div></div><p>As any oppressive authoritarian regime knows, physical restraints are less effective than mental ones. Why build prisons when you can brainwash people into doing what you want? Because your thoughts define your limitations, you must question your own assumptions.</p><p>Assumptions aren't necessarily bad. When you send email, you assume it's going to get to the intended recipient. When you save a file, you assume it's going to be on your hard disk the next time you want it. An assumption is basically a mental shortcut that allows you to think about something else. Few people would send email if they had to worry whether it would really arrive at its destination or not, and almost nobody would use a computer if they couldn't assume their files would still be on their hard disk after saving them. Unfortunately, assumptions aren't always right. Email doesn't always reach its intended recipient, and sometimes when you save a file, a virus or computer crash can make it disappear.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although useful, assumptions can lead to several problems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Assumptions may be based on beliefs rather than facts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Assumptions may be based on facts taken out of context.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Assumptions, whether based on facts or beliefs, limit and restrict thinking.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the world of technology, Bell Telephone created its telephone monopoly and assumed people would use it to make phone calls the way Bell Telephone intended. When phone phreakers defied this assumption and rummaged through the telephone system on their own, the facts proved that phreakers were manipulating the phone system in ways that even the telephone company had never dreamed of. (See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. The First Hackers: The Phone Phreakers">Chapter 2</a> for more on phone phreaking.)</p><p>Many of the flaws in computer security stem from assumptions based on beliefs rather than facts. Computer scientists believe that a particular program is secure—until hackers discover that manipulating a program feature in an unintended manner can crack open that computer's defenses.</p><p>Sometimes assumptions can be based on facts that hold true in certain circumstances but not in others. When Microsoft created MS-DOS and Windows, it assumed that those operating systems were safe, and they were—until people began connecting computers to local area networks (LANs) and the Internet. In isolation, MS-DOS and Windows were safe platforms. In a network, these same operating systems became breeding grounds for viruses, Trojan horses, and worms (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Ansi Bombs and Viruses">Chapter 4</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Trojan Horses and Worms">Chapter 5</a>).</p><p>When computer scientists created standards for sending and receiving email over the Internet, they assumed that people would only send emails to people they knew. Unfortunately, they never foresaw that free message delivery would attract unscrupulous salespeople and create the nuisance known as spam (see <a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. Identity Theft and Spam">Chapter 18</a>).</p><p>Even if assumptions are based on facts, they still limit your thinking. When faced with a computer login screen, most people automatically assume that the only way to get past this first line of defense is to type a valid user name and password, either by stealing or guessing it. If you make that assumption, however, you might never come up with alternate approaches, such as flooding the computer with a massive chunk of data that has an executable program tacked on the end. This can overload the computer's memory and allow the executable program to run without the computer recognizing it, essentially bypassing any security measures, including a request for a valid password. (See <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Cracking Passwords">Chapter 9</a> for more information about sneaking past a computer's defenses.)</p><p>By identifying assumptions, you can better understand how they may have influenced your current thoughts and actions. Then you can deliberately break out of their inherent restrictions by challenging your assumptions. You might discover something new simply by looking at the world from another point of view.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Developing Values"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="developing_values"/>Developing Values</h1></div></div></div><p>Of course, if you do nothing but question authorities and assumptions, you'll wind up reacting to life rather than pursuing it, much like adolescents who define themselves by rebelling against their parents' wishes and values, rather than choosing the life they want to live on their own.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So in addition to questioning authorities and assumptions, hackers also develop a sense of values to guide their actions. Values, like assumptions, are beliefs, but they are beliefs generated from within and not imposed by others, such as parents or governments. At the simplest level, values help people make choices, such as whether they choose Linux over Windows or learn the Perl programming language rather than C++.</p><p>Shared values can forge friendships (for an example of people using technology to promote their ideas, visit Republican Voices at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.republicanvoices.org">www.republicanvoices.org</a>); conflicting values can tear people apart (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Hate Groups and Terrorists on the Internet">Chapter 17</a> for more information about hate groups and terrorists).</p><p>Anyone can choose values, especially values that will garner favor from others. For example, politicians may endorse the values of religious organizations just to gain their political support, and then promptly ignore those same religious values ("Thou shalt not commit adultery" or "Thou shalt not kill") when they finally get elected to office. What's more important than the values you choose is whether you abide by them all the time or only when it's convenient, which reveals your <span class="emphasis"><em>true</em></span> values.</p><p>Hypocrisy is what fuels rebellions in the first place, causing others to question an authority figure's standing as an authority and reject any values that person may want to force on them (see <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Hacktivism: Online Activism">Chapter 16</a> for more information about political activism on the Internet). When authorities want to mask their own hypocrisy, they often resort to censorship (see <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Censoring Information">Chapter 11</a>) and lies (see <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Propaganda as News and Entertainment">Chapter 15</a> for more information about propaganda).</p><p>In the world of computer hacking, people only know who you are by your online actions. Your identity may be anonymous, but your true personality isn't, and that's what makes the world of computers both liberating and terrifying at the same time, depending on who you really are.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Three Stages of Hacking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_three_stages_of_hacking"/>The Three Stages of Hacking</h1></div></div></div><p>The mentality of a hacker typically goes through three stages, whether the hacker is merely exploring a new operating system or learning social skills for work situations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Stage I: Curiosity</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stage II: Control</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stage III: Conscious intent</p></li></ul></div><p>Hackers come from different backgrounds and cultures, but every hacker shares the same sense of curiosity that drew him or her to the technology in the first place. At the initial curiosity stage, hackers simply want to know how things work, whether they're studying the Internet, a copy-protected DVD, or the telephone system. At the outset, hackers want to understand what's possible and why.</p><p>Once they learn enough about a particular system, hackers can graduate to the second stage of hacking, in which they gradually learn to control and manipulate the system. Any problems that hackers cause at this point, such as crashing a computer or erasing a hard disk, occur more often out of sheer clumsiness than deliberate intent.</p><p>Hackers reach the third and final stage when they put their newfound skills to work for a purpose. At this point, hackers seek a specific result; whether it's good or bad is irrelevant. Hackers want to achieve whatever goal they set for themselves, and they're willing to pursue it with relentless determination until they get there.</p><p>No matter what the intention or the result, hacking involves tackling new challenges and stimulating your mind. It sometimes involves breaking the law and trespassing on other people's property, but many times it's just about having fun. Whether hackers are rerouting phone calls, modifying software, or stealing passwords over the Internet, hacking isn't about proving anyone wrong. Hacking is about proving that other ways of doing things can also be right.</p></div>

</span></span></div></div><p>The first phone phreakers were teenage boys.</p><p>That fact alone isn't too surprising, until you realize that those first hackers appeared in 1878, when teenage boys worked as telephone operators for the fledgling Bell Telephone network. Hiring teenage boys seemed logical; telegraph offices often hired them to work similar jobs as telegraph delivery messengers. Putting teenage boys in charge of the telephone network made good sense right up until they started randomly mixing telephone lines to connect total strangers as a prank and started talking back to customers and interfering in their conversations just for laughs.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Bell Telephone quickly replaced its prepubescent male operators with more dependable women. Still, the spirit of playfulness that first surfaced among those teenagers would soon reappear to haunt the telephone networks again.</p><p>When the telephone company replaced human operators with automated electronic switching systems (ESSs) in the 1960s, the telephone hackers (also known by their more colorful nickname, <span class="emphasis"><em>phone phreakers</em></span>) found new opportunities to toy with the telephone system.</p><p>You couldn't always trick a human operator into granting you free phone calls, but you could trick the telephone network's automated switching systems into doing so. With nothing but primitive computers routing telephone calls around the country, phone phreakers quickly learned that if you knew the right signals, you could get the telephone system to do anything from granting free long-distance telephone calls to letting you connect multiple phone lines to form conference calls—all without the telephone company's knowledge.</p><div class="sect1" title="A Short History of Phone Phreaking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="a_short_history_of_phone_phreaking"/>A Short History of Phone Phreaking</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike computer hacking, which can often be practiced in isolation on a single personal computer, phone phreaking was pretty complicated and thus required more extensive preparation. You might be reprogramming the phone company's computers one moment, soldering wires together to alter a pay phone the next, and then chatting with a telephone employee to get the passwords for a different part of the phone system. Like computer hacking, phone phreaking is an intellectual game in which players try to learn as much as they can about the system (usually) without getting caught.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Perhaps the most famous phone phreaker is John Draper (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.webcrunchers.com/crunch">www.webcrunchers.com/crunch</a>), nicknamed Captain Crunch because of his accidental discovery of a unique use for a toy whistle found in a box of Cap'n Crunch cereal. He found that blowing this toy whistle into his phone's mouthpiece emitted a 2600Hz tone, the exact frequency used to instruct the telephone company's switching systems to make free telephone calls.</p><p>Others soon discovered this secret, and some even developed the ability to whistle a perfect 2600Hz tone. For those unable to obtain the original Cap'n Crunch toy whistle, entrepreneurs began selling devices known as <span class="emphasis"><em>blue boxes</em></span> that emitted the 2600Hz tone and other telephone company signal tones. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the founders of Apple Computer, even sold blue boxes to college students so they could make free phone calls from their dormitories.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Blue boxes worked as long as the telephone company relied on their old electromechanical switching systems. But eventually these were replaced with newer electronic switching systems (ESSs), which rendered blue boxes (and the infamous 2600Hz tone) useless (although blue boxes may still work on older phone systems outside the United States).</p><p>Of course, ESSs brought with them a whole new set of problems. With the older electromechanical switching systems, a technician had to physically manipulate switches and wires to modify the switching system. With an ESS, technicians could alter the switching system remotely over the phone lines.</p><p>If a technician could perform this magic over the telephone, however, phone phreakers could do the same—if they knew the proper codes and procedures. Obviously, the telephone company wanted to keep this information secret, but the phone phreakers wanted to let everyone know how the telephone system worked (which is partly what the ongoing struggle between the telephone company and phone phreakers is all about).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>To learn more about phone phreaking, visit Hack Canada (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hackcanada.com">www.hackcanada.com</a>) or Phone Losers of America (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.phonelosers.org">www.phonelosers.org</a>).

Steve Wozniak reportedly once called the Vatican and pretended to be Henry Kissinger. Other phone phreakers have attempted to call the Kremlin via the White House hotline and have rerouted a prominent TV evangelist's business number to a 1-900 sex line.</p><p>Because a large part of phone phreaking lore involves performing progressively more outrageous acts and then boasting about them, the following phone phreaking stories may or may not be true. Nevertheless, they will give you an idea of what phone phreakers can achieve given the right information.

In the early '70s, two phone phreakers discovered an unlisted phone number that only a handful of people had the right to know about. They decided to use it to make the ultimate prank phone call. What follows is an edited version of the firsthand account of one of the phreakers</em></span>.</p><p>[At the time of the prank,] it was really easy for phone phreakers to pop into the phone company's AutoVerify trunks. This procedure is used when someone legitimately needs to break in on a busy phone line. Ordinarily, it goes like this:</p><p>The operator selects a special trunk (phone line), class marked (reserved) for this service, and dials either the last five digits of the phone number, or a special Terminating Toll Center (TTC) code like 052, followed by the entire seven-digit number. After that, the operator hears scrambled conversation on the line. The parties talking hear nothing, not even a click.</p><p>Next, the operator "flashes forward" by causing the equipment to send a tone burst at 2600Hz, which makes a three-way connection and places a beep tone on the line so that both original parties can hear the click (flash, in this case) followed by a high-pitched beep. At this point, the parties can hear the operator and vice versa. In the case of a legitimate interruption, the operator announces that there is an emergency and the line should be released. This service is available today for a $2 fee ($1 in certain areas).</p><p>Earlier, I had mapped every 800 number that terminated in Washington, DC, by scanning the entire 800-424 prefix. That scan found an impressive quantity of juicy numbers that allowed free access to Congressional phone lines, special White House access numbers, and so on.</p><p>While scanning 800-424, I got this dude whose bad attitude caught my attention. I was determined to find out who he was. I called back and said, "This is White Plains tandem office for AT&amp;T, which subscriber have we reached?"</p><p>This person said, "This is the White House CIA crisis hotline!"</p><p>"Oh!" I said, "We're having a problem with crossed lines. Now that I know who this is, I can fix it. Thank you for your time—good-bye!"</p><p>I had a very special 800 number.</p><p>Eventually my friends and I had one of our info-exchanging binges, and I mentioned this incident to them. One friend wanted to dial it immediately, but I persuaded him to wait. I wanted to pop up on the line, using AutoVerify to hear the conversation.</p><p>But first we needed to determine which exchange this number terminated in, because AutoVerify didn't know about 800 numbers.</p><p>At the time, all 800 numbers had a one-to-one relation between prefix and area code. For instance, 800-424 = 202-<span class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span>, where <span class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> was the three-digit exchange determined by the last four digits. In this case, 800-424-9337 mapped to 202-227-9337. The 227 (which could be wrong) was a special White House prefix used for faxes, telexes, and, in this case, the CIA crisis line.</p><p>Next we got into the class marked trunk (which had a different sounding chirp when seized) and MF'ed KP-054-227-9337-ST into this special class marked trunk. ("MF" stands for multi-frequency, the method by which the phone phreakers sent the specific code into the telephone trunk.) Immediately we heard the connection tone and put it up on the speaker so we would know when a call came in.</p><p>Several hours later, a call came in. It appeared to have CIA-related talk, and the code name "Olympus" was used to summon the president. I had been in another part of the building and rushed into the room just in time to hear the tail end of the conversation.</p><p>We had the code word that would summon Nixon to the phone. Almost immediately, another friend started to dial the number. I stopped him and recommended that he stack at least four tandems (switches connecting different lines or trunks of the telephone network) before looping the call to the White House. (Stacking tandems means routing a phone call between different switches, making it harder for anyone to trace exactly which phone number you're calling from. After routing a phone call through multiple switches, looping connects the caller to the desired phone number.)</p><p>Sure enough, the man at the other end said "9337."</p><p>My other friend said, "Olympus, please!"</p><p>The man at the other end said, "One moment, sir!"

However, as the two phone phreakers in the following example found out, sometimes a crank call can go a little bit too far</em></span> . . .</p><p>Two Southern Californian phone phreakers once tied up every long-distance line coming into Santa Barbara using two side-by-side phone booths on the beach and some very simple phone phreaking equipment. When people tried to call into Santa Barbara, their calls were rerouted to the two phreakers, who told all callers that a mysterious explosion had wiped out the city.</p><p>The first call was from a mother to her son, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. The two phreakers told the woman that they were with the National Guard Emergency Communications Center and that there was no longer any University of California at Santa Barbara. In breathless tones they said the campus and, in fact, the entire city of Santa Barbara had been wiped out in a freakish nuclear accident; a "nuclear meltdown," they told her. She was politely asked to hang up in order to clear the line for emergency phone calls.</p><p>A few minutes later the horrified mother called back, this time with operator assistance. The phone phreakers calmly repeated their story to the operator, asked her not to place calls to Santa Barbara, and told her not to worry.</p><p>Within minutes, newspaper and television reporters, FBI agents, and police officers began calling from all over the country. Hundreds of anxious people who had heard about the "meltdown" phoned to check on relatives and friends. The phreakers told the callers that they had reached the National Guard base 50 miles away from the disaster site and that they were tied into emergency circuits. After about an hour the two phreakers became frightened by the chaos they were causing and restored the phone system to normal. They were never caught.</p><p>The next day, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></span> carried a short news article headlined "Nuclear hoax in Santa Barbara." The text explained how authorities were freaked out and how puzzled they were. The phone company commented, "We don't really know how this happened, but it cleared right up!"</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The president's secret"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_president_apostrophy_s_secret"/>The president's secret</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Phone phreakers don't necessarily abuse their power over the telephone system; they just want to explore every part of the phone network and understand how it operates. But as this phone phreaker discovered, sometimes certain phone numbers are best left alone</em></span>.</p><p>Some years back, a telephone fanatic in the Northwest made an interesting discovery about the 804 area code (Virginia). He found that the 840 exchange in the 804 area code did something strange. In calling every 804-840-<span class="emphasis"><em>xxxx</em></span> phone number but one, he would get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he dialed 804-840 followed by four rather predictable numbers (like 1-2-3-4), he got a ring!</p><p>After one or two rings, somebody picked up. Because he was experienced with this kind of thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe," that is, no charges were being incurred for calling this number. (Calls that get you to an error message or a special operator generally don't "supe," or supervise.) A female voice with a hint of a southern accent said, "Operator, can I help you?"</p><p>"Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"</p><p>"What number did you dial, sir?"</p><p>He made up a number that was similar.</p><p>"I'm sorry. That is not the number you reached." Click.</p><p>He was fascinated. What in the world was this? He knew he was going to call back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He tried the 840 exchange in several other area codes. In some, it came up as a valid exchange. In others, exactly the same thing happened—the same last four digits, the same southern belle.</p><p>He later noticed that the area codes where the number functioned properly formed a beeline from Washington, DC, to Pittsburgh, PA. He called back from a pay phone.</p><p>"Operator, can I help you?"</p><p>"Yes, this is the phone company. I'm testing this line and we don't seem to have an identification on your circuit. What office is this, please?"</p><p>"What number are you trying to reach?"</p><p>"I'm not trying to reach any number. I'm trying to identify this circuit."</p><p>"I'm sorry, I can't help you."</p><p>"Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it. We show no record of it here."</p><p>"Hold on a moment, sir."</p><p>After about a minute, she came back. "Sir, I can have someone speak to you. Would you give me your number, please?"</p><p>He had anticipated this and had the pay phone number ready. After he gave it, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."</p><p>"Thanks." He hung up the phone. It rang. Instantly. "Oh my God," he thought, "They weren't asking for my number—they were confirming it!"</p><p>"Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>"This is Mr. XXX. Did you just make an inquiry to my office concerning a phone number?"</p><p>"Yes. I need an identi- . . ."</p><p>"What you need is advice. Don't ever call that number again. Forget you ever knew it."</p><p>At this point my friend got so nervous, he immediately hung up. He expected to hear the phone ring again, but it didn't.</p><p>Over the next few days, he racked his brain trying to figure out what the number was. He knew it was something big—so big that the number was programmed into every central office in the country. He knew this because if he tried to dial any other number in that exchange, he'd get a local error message, as if the exchange didn't exist.</p><p>It finally came to him. He had an uncle who worked for a federal agency. If, as he suspected, this was government-related, his uncle could probably find out what it was. He asked the next day and his uncle promised to look into it.</p><p>When they met again, his uncle was livid. He was trembling. "Where did you get that number?" he shouted. "Do you know I almost got fired for asking about it? They kept wanting to know where I got it!"</p><p>Our friend couldn't contain his excitement. "What is it?" he pleaded. "What's the number?"</p><p>"IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER!"</p><p>He never called the number again after that. He knew that he could probably cause quite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying something like, "The weather's not good in Washington. We're coming over for a visit." But my friend was smart. He knew that there were some things that were better left unsaid and undone.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="True and Verified Phone Phreaking Stories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="true_and_verified_phone_phreaking_storie"/>True and Verified Phone Phreaking Stories</h1></div></div></div><p>The previous phone phreaking stories may be more fiction than fact. However, the following tales are true, and perhaps more frightening than anything anyone could ever make up.</p><div class="sect2" title="Making free phone calls, courtesy of the Israeli Army"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="making_free_phone_calls_comma_courtesy_o"/>Making free phone calls, courtesy of the Israeli Army</h2></div></div></div><p>The Israeli Army is considered the best in the world; even its radio stations enjoy round-the-clock protection provided by armed soldiers patrolling the perimeters. But those radio stations aren't safe from phone phreakers. Armed guards and barbed wire mean nothing to someone who can probe a network through the telephone lines. And as blind phone phreaker Munther "Ramy" Badir explains, an army outpost has phone lines that cannot be tapped by the police, so there is no monitoring. "These are the safest lines on which to do something."</p><p>In 1993, Ramy and his two brothers Muzher and Shadde Badir, all completely blind since birth, drew the attention of authorities when they broke into Bezeq International, Israel's largest telecommunications provider. After hacking Bezeq's phone networks and giving themselves calling privileges, the Badir brothers made a deal to direct phone calls to a Dominican Republic phone sex service and get paid for each call. (Visit any hacker website and you'll see it's common to direct visitors to sex services as a money-making scheme.)</p><p>To ensure that they would get paid as much as possible, the Badir brothers made phone calls to the Dominican Republican sex service themselves, billing their phone calls to companies such as Nortel and Comverse. When a Bezeq International anti-fraud engineer discovered the lines the Badir brothers were using and blocked them, the brothers simply called Bezeq International, impersonated the anti-fraud engineer's voice, and ordered the lines unblocked.</p><p>Next the brothers attacked an Israeli phone sex service and talked the secretary into revealing her boss's computer password. Armed with this information, they hacked into the phone sex service's computers and made off with 20,000 customer credit card numbers. When the sex service's boss confronted them, they retaliated by programming all his telephones to ring continuously, with no one on the line.</p><p>According to authorities, the Badir brothers next broke into an Israeli Army radio station's phone system and activated a function called Direct Inward Systems Access (DISA). Not only did this allow multiple people to share a single telephone line, but it also enabled anyone to place long-distance phone calls that would be charged to the Israeli Army radio station.</p><p>Next, the brothers sold access to the hacked phone system so that anyone could make free phone calls from their home, cloned cell phones, or phone kiosks set up along the Gaza Strip. As Israeli authorities closed in on them, the brothers fought back by taking down the police phone systems, crashing their computers, and even eavesdropping on their telephone calls.</p><p>When Israeli police finally raided the Badir brothers' home, they found nothing more incriminating than an ordinary laptop computer. "It's all in our heads," Ramy said. "The police took my laptop, which contained programs for running through thousands of numbers very quickly, but I had it designed to erase everything on the hard drive if it was opened by somebody other than me. They lost all the material."</p><p>Between 1999 and 2004, Ramy ultimately spent a little more than four years in prison and his brothers served community service and a suspended sentence. Like many reformed hackers, Ramy insists that he's now going to work in security. "I am inventing a PBX firewall. I know all the weakest spots of a telephone system. I can protect any system from infiltration. I am going to the other side, coming up with devices that will keep the phreakers out."</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Phone phreaking for escorts in Las Vegas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phone_phreaking_for_escorts_in_las_vegas"/>Phone phreaking for escorts in Las Vegas</h2></div></div></div><p>While most phone phreakers use their skills to make free phone calls or to toy around with the telephone system, some have used their skills to help organized crime syndicates reroute phone calls around Las Vegas.</p><p>If you've ever walked along the Las Vegas Strip, you've been bombarded by people handing out flyers and brochures for all types of in-room adult entertainment services. Vending machines bolted to the sidewalks also freely dispense similar pornographic "reading" material, showing bodies, names, and telephone numbers. With such an abundance of pornographic material within reach of any passerby, you'd think that these escort services would be inundated with phone calls from lonely visitors holed up in hotel rooms across the city.</p><p>In the old days, that was true. Nowadays, though, despite the abundance of advertising, these adult entertainment businesses are lucky to get one or two calls a night, and, inevitably, these calls come from people who are either outside of Las Vegas or calling from a pay phone or cell phone. These phone calls aren't routed through the big casino/hotel switchboards in Las Vegas. If anyone tries to call these services from the telephone in a Las Vegas hotel room, the calls either don't connect or are mysteriously rerouted to a rival adult entertainment service (presumably controlled by organized crime). Naturally, most callers aren't aware that their phone call went to a different service provider than the one they called, since they wind up getting a woman to come to their room anyway.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Sometimes the phone calls aren't rerouted but are traced instead. So when a caller reaches an adult entertainment service, a rival service that's tracing the phone line sends a girl to the customer first. By the time the girl from the intended adult service shows up, the customer is already being serviced by the competition's girl.</p><p>The next time you're in Las Vegas, pick up a brochure for an adult entertainment business off the Strip and call using your hotel room telephone. Spend the next 10 or 15 minutes asking questions and then hang up without asking for a girl. If a rival adult service has been tracing your call, a girl should show up at your hotel room within 15 minutes anyway, asking, "Did you call for an entertainer?" Ask the girl what service she came from and she'll likely respond with a noncommittal answer such as, "Which service did you call? I work for several of them."</p><p>Then again, you might want to avoid this experiment altogether, since wasting the time (and money) of those in organized crime is rarely a healthy decision.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Phone Phreaking Tools and Techniques"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="phone_phreaking_tools_and_techniques"/>Phone Phreaking Tools and Techniques</h1></div></div></div><p>The goal of every phone phreaker is to learn more about the telephone system, preferably without paying for any phone calls in the process. Whether they access the telephone system from an appliance inside their own home, a public pay phone, or someone else's "borrowed" (stolen) phone line, phone phreakers have found a variety of ways to avoid paying for their phone calls.</p><div class="sect2" title="Shoulder surfing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="shoulder_surfing"/>Shoulder surfing</h2></div></div></div><p>The crudest level of phreaking is known as shoulder surfing, which is simply looking over another person's shoulder as they punch in their telephone calling card number at a public pay phone.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The prime locations for shoulder surfing are airports, where travelers are more likely to use calling cards than change to make a call. Given the hectic nature of a typical airport, few people take notice of someone peering over their shoulder while they punch in their calling card number, or listening in as they give it to an operator.</p><p>Once you have another person's calling card number, you can charge as many calls as you like until the victim receives the next billing statement and notices your mysterious phone calls. Of course, once the victim notifies the phone company, that calling card number is usually canceled. (Since shoulder surfing involves stealing from individuals, true phone phreakers look down on it as an activity unworthy of anyone but common thieves and juvenile delinquents. True phone pheakers only believe in stealing service from the telephone company, and even then they don't feel that they're actually causing any harm or costing the company any money.)<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As more people rely on cell phones and fewer on pay phones and calling cards, shoulder surfing is a dying art, but it can still be a handy technique for stealing a password or PIN from someone using a computer or automated teller machine.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Phone phreaking with color boxes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phone_phreaking_with_color_boxes"/>Phone phreaking with color boxes</h2></div></div></div><p>Another way to avoid paying for phone calls is to trick the phone company into thinking either that you already paid for them or that you never made them in the first place. To physically manipulate the phone networks, phone phreakers trick the telephone system through telephone color boxes, which either emit special tones or physically alter the wiring on the phone line.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0019" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although the Internet abounds with instructions and plans for building various telephone color boxes, many of the older ones, such as blue boxes, no longer work with today's phone systems in the United States—although they might still work in other countries, particularly Third World nations where old technology has been redeployed.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0020" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Here are some descriptions of various color boxes that others have made and used. But first, a warning from a phone phreaker regarding the legality of building and using such boxes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>You have received this information courtesy of neXus. We do not claim to be hackers, phreaks, pirates, traitors, etc. We only believe that an alternative to making certain info/ideas illegal as a means to keep people from doing bad things - is make information free, and educate people how to handle free information responsibly. Please think and act responsibly. Don't get cockey, don't get pushy. There is always gonna be someone out there that can kick your ass. Remember that.</p></blockquote></div><div class="sect3" title="Blue box"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="blue_box"/>Blue box</h3></div></div></div><p>The blue box, the first of the telephone color boxes, reportedly got its name because the first one confiscated by police just happened to be blue. To use a blue box, phone phreakers would dial a phone number to connect to the telephone network and then turn on the box to emit its 2600Hz tone. This tricked the telephone system into thinking that they had hung up. Then the phone phreaker could either whistle different tones or use additional color boxes to emit tones that would dial an actual phone number. Since the blue box had already tricked the telephone system into thinking the caller had hung up, the subsequent calls made would not be charged.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Red box"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="red_box"/>Red box</h3></div></div></div><p>When you insert a coin into a pay phone, it triggers a relay that emits a tone specific to that coin (a nickel makes a different sound than a dime or a quarter). A <span class="emphasis"><em>red box</em></span> simulates the sound of money dropping into a pay phone. The telephone system listens to all the tones emitted to determine how much money has been deposited. When the total amount deposited equals the amount needed to make a phone call, the telephone system connects the pay phone to the network.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0023" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Green box"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="green_box"/>Green box</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>green box</em></span> generates three tones that can control a pay phone: coin collect (CC), coin return (CR), and ringback (RB). What happens is that one phone phreaker uses an ordinary pay phone to call a phone phreaker who has a green box attached to his phone. The phone phreaker receiving the call can activate the green box to send the coin collect (CC) tone (to trick the pay phone into thinking the phone phreaker dropped money into the pay phone), the coin return (CR) tone (to force the pay phone to spit coins into its return slot), or the ringback (RB) tone (to cause the green box phone to call the pay phone, allowing the phone phreaker at the pay phone to receive a phone call and talk to the other person free of charge).</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Black box"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="black_box"/>Black box</h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike blue boxes or red boxes, which prevent you from being charged for making calls, a <span class="emphasis"><em>black box</em></span> prevents other people from being charged when they call you.</p><p>A black box works by controlling the voltage on your phone line. Before you receive a phone call, the voltage is zero. It jumps to 48V, however, the moment the phone rings. As soon as you pick up the phone, it drops back down to 10V, and the phone company begins billing the calling party.</p><p>A black box keeps the voltage on your phone line at a steady 36V so that it never drops low enough to signal the phone company to start billing. As far as the telephone company can tell, your phone keeps ringing because you haven't answered it yet, even while you're chatting happily with your friends. (Black box calls should be kept short, however, because the telephone company may get suspicious if your phone keeps "ringing" for a long period of time without the caller hanging up.)</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Silver box"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="silver_box"/>Silver box</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>silver box</em></span> modifies your phone to generate four special tones designated "A"—Flash, "B"—Flash Override Priority, "C"—Priority Communication, and "D"—Priority Overide (Top Military). Although the telephone company has never designated any official use for these extra tones, that hasn't stopped phone phreakers from experimenting with them. For example, phone phreakers discovered that if you generated the "D" tone and pressed 6 or 7, you could reach loop ends, which are two phone numbers that the telephone company uses to test connections. If two phone phreakers accessed these loop ends at the same time, they could make free phone calls to each other.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Phone phreaking with color box programs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phone_phreaking_with_color_box_programs"/>Phone phreaking with color box programs</h2></div></div></div><p>Making a telephone color box often involved soldering or connecting wires, resistors, and capacitors together. But with the advent of personal computers, people found they could write programs to mimic different telephone color boxes. By running these programs on a laptop or handheld computer and placing the mouthpiece of the phone over the computer speaker, phone phreakers could manipulate the telephone system without having to build actual boxes.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0029" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although telephone color boxes are largely obsolete, many phone phreakers have created software implementations of their favorite ones, dubbed <span class="emphasis"><em>tone generators</em></span>. For example, Hack Canada (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hackcanada.com">www.hackcanada.com</a>) offers a red box program (called RedPalm) that runs on a Palm handheld computer, and some hacker sites still offer a combination red/blue box program dubbed Switchboard (see <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#the_switchboard_program_mimics_a_blue_co" title="Figure 2-1. The Switchboard program mimics a blue, red, green, and silver box for emitting tones from a computer.">Figure 2-1</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0030" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Remember, tone generators simply play different tones, just like an MP3 player.

War dialers are an old, but still effective, method for breaking into another computer (see <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#a_war_dialer_can_scan_a_range_of_phone_n" title="Figure 2-2. A war dialer can scan a range of phone numbers to find one that has a waiting computer and modem on the other end.">Figure 2-2</a>).</p><p>War dialers try a range of phone numbers in a hunt for telephone lines connected to a modem and a computer, which makes every person, corporation, and organization a potential target. The war dialers record the phone numbers that respond with the familiar whine of a computer (or fax) modem, and a hacker can then use this list and dial each number individually to determine what type of computer he has reached and how he might be able to break into it.</p><p>For example, many businesses have special phone lines that allow traveling employees to control their desktop computers with their laptop computers and remote-control software, such as pcAnywhere or LapLink. If a hacker finds this special phone number and uses a copy of the same software, guess what? With the right password, he can take over the desktop computer too and then erase or copy all of its files.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0033" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since war dialers repetitively dial a range of phone numbers, such as 483-1000, 483-1001, 483-1002, and so on, many companies try to find and stop any such repetitive dialing. To defeat this, war dialers can be reprogrammed to throw off any possible detection attempts by dialing a range of phone numbers in nonsequential order.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_war_dialer_can_scan_a_range_of_phone_n"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1126"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676461.png.jpg" alt="A war dialer can scan a range of phone numbers to find one that has a waiting computer and modem on the other end."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-2. A war dialer can scan a range of phone numbers to find one that has a waiting computer and modem on the other end.</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>To defeat war dialers, many companies use a callback device that's only designed to accept specific numbers. When someone wants to connect to the company computer, they need to call from one of the preapproved numbers stored in the callback device's memory. Once they connect, they send a signal to the callback device to call back to one of the preapproved phone numbers. The caller then hangs up and waits for that call. Since the callback device restricts the phone numbers allowed to connect to the computer, hackers are effectively blocked from breaking into a computer through a modem (hopefully).<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0034" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Like any tool, war dialers can be used by hackers to break into a computer or by security professionals to probe a company's vulnerabilities. Since computer security is so lucrative, SandStorm Enterprises (<a class="ulink" href="http://sandstorm.net">http://sandstorm.net</a>) sells a commercial war dialer called PhoneSweep, which is designed for security professionals to test for any unsecured modems connected to their company's phone system. Unlike most hacker war dialers, PhoneSweep can generate reports and graphs that show the percentage of phone numbers called that had a modem or returned a busy signal.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0042" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As a free alternative to PhoneSweep, download a copy of TeleSweep Secure from SecureLogix (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.securelogix.com">www.securelogix.com</a>). SecureLogix originally sold TeleSweep Secure commercially, but now gives it away for free in the hopes that satisfied customers will upgrade to its Voice Firewall product.</p><p>Since war dialers can dial a number repeatedly, they can also be used to harass people. Some of the more unusual harassment programs can dial a single number over and over again at random intervals or play a computer-generated voice to insult a caller the moment he or she picks up the phone (have a look at Shit Talker in <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#many_hacker_programs_are_designed_specif" title="Figure 2-3. Many hacker programs are designed specifically to harass others.">Figure 2-3</a>).

At the simplest level, stealing cell phone service can be as easy as signing up using a fake or stolen identity, although it's even easier just to steal someone's cell phone and use it until the real owner cancels the service.</p><p>Of course, both of these methods are fairly crude. For a more sophisticated way to steal cell phone service, thieves have turned to <span class="emphasis"><em>cloning</em></span>.</p><p>Every cell phone contains both a unique electronic serial number (ESN) and a mobile identification number (MIN). Every time someone uses a cell phone, he transmits his unique ESN and MIN to the cell phone network, which verifies that the ESN/MIN combination is valid.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0043" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The problem is that when older analog cell phones transmitted their ESN/MIN numbers at the start of every call, anyone with a cell phone scanner could intercept those numbers and store them on another cell phone, essentially cloning the ESN/MIN numbers of a valid cell phone. Any calls made through this "cloned" cell phone would show up on the bill of the legitimate cell phone customer.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0052" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since a cloned phone can only be used until the real cell phone owner notices the outrageous number of additional calls showing up on the bill, some thieves resort to a technique known as <span class="emphasis"><em>tumbling</em></span>. Originally, tumbling meant using a random ESN and MIN number to make a free call. Once the cell phone company received these random ESN/MIN numbers, they had to validate these numbers. Since this process could take time, the cell phone companies often let random ESN/MIN numbers get one free phone call without validating the numbers. Eventually, the cell phone companies could validate ESN/MIN numbers almost instantaneously, so tumbling took a new form where a thief steals multiple combinations of valid ESN/MIN numbers and uses a different one each time he makes a phone call. Tumbling spreads out the number of illegal phone calls among a large number of legitimate cell phone owners, who are more likely to accept (or not notice) one or two strange calls rather than dozens each month.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0053" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In part to protect users from cloning fraud, cell phone companies have introduced digital transmission and encryption, often advertised with cryptic names such as TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), GSM (Global System for Multiple Communication), or Spread Spectrum. (Analog cell phones used FDMA, which stands for Frequency Division Multiple Access.)<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0056" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In additional to encrypting a cellular phone's ESN/MIN numbers, many cellular phone networks now include voice and radio frequency authentication. Voice authentication can identify unfamiliar calling patterns and radio frequency authentication can identify the unique radio frequency characteristics (known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>fingerprint</em></span>) of each cell phone.</p><p>Such defenses are expensive, which means they're more often used in big cities while rural areas are left unprotected. To protect yourself, study your cell phone bills every month to identify strange calls. Also, minimize your cell phone use in areas such as airport terminals or parking lots since cell phone thieves scan the airwaves in crowded places where people are most likely to use cell phones.</p><p>To keep up with the latest cell phone hacking news and information, visit Cell Phone Hacks (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cellphonehacks.com">www.cellphonehacks.com</a>), Collusion Magazine (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collusion.org">www.collusion.org</a>), or the Temple of the Screaming Electron (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.totse.com">www.totse.com</a>), which is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#hacker_websites_and_e-zines_offer_inform" title="Figure 2-4. Hacker websites and e-zines offer information about cloning cell phones and stealing cell phone service.">Figure 2-4</a>.</p><p>While phone phreakers aren't likely to target your personal cell phone, they are likely to target the cell phones of celebrities like Paris Hilton (if you can legitimately call Paris Hilton a "celebrity"). In 2005, a 17-year-old Massachusetts teenager hacked into Paris Hilton's cell phone and spread her cell phone number, along with the cell phone numbers and email addresses of Ashlee Simpson, Christina Aguilera, Ashley Olsen, Vin Diesel, former O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro, Anna Kournikova, Eminem, and Lindsay Lohan, across the Internet.</p><p>Not surprisingly, this teenager didn't hack into Paris Hilton's cell phone using some undiscovered flaw. Instead, this teenager took advantage of the fact that Paris Hilton's cell phone was protected by a password. If Paris Hilton forgot her password, she could still access her cell phone by answering the default question, "What is your favorite pet's name?"</p><p>Since Paris Hilton made no secret of her love and affection for her Chihuahua, named Tinkerbell, it was a simple matter of typing in "Tinkerbell" to gain access to Paris Hilton's cell phone. As this Paris Hilton cell phone hack showed, sometimes the simplest solutions are the best way to sneak past any technical defenses.</p><div class="figure"><a id="hacker_websites_and_e-zines_offer_inform"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1277"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676465.png.jpg" alt="Hacker websites and e-zines offer information about cloning cell phones and stealing cell phone service."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-4. Hacker websites and e-zines offer information about cloning cell phones and stealing cell phone service.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Hacking voice mailboxes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hacking_voice_mailboxes"/>Hacking voice mailboxes</h2></div></div></div><p>Voice mail is the corporate alternative to answering machines. Rather than give each employee a separate answering machine, voice mail provides multiple mailboxes on a single machine. Because a voice mail system is nothing more than a programmable computer, phone phreakers quickly found a way to set up their own private voice mailboxes buried within legitimate voice mailbox systems.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0060" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To find a voice mail system, phone phreakers simply use a war dialer to find a corporate voice mail system phone number. (Many even have toll-free numbers for the convenience of corporate executives.) After calling the voice mail system, users often need to press a key, such as * or #, to enter the mailbox. A recording will usually ask for a valid mailbox number, typically three or four digits. Finally, users type a password to access the mailbox, play back messages, or record a new message or greeting.</p><p>Most people choose a password that's easy to remember (and easy to guess). Some people base their password on their mailbox number, either the mailbox number itself or the mailbox number backwards (if the mailbox number is 2108, try 8012 as the password). Others might use a password that consists of a repeated number (such as 3333) or a simple series (6789).</p><p>Once a phone phreaker finds a voice mail system phone number, the next step is to guess a password for one or more mailboxes, either by typing in a series of passwords or by running a voice mailbox hacking program, like VMB Hacker, that dials a range of three- or four-digit numbers until it finds a combination that works (see <a class="xref" href="ch02s04.html#a_voice_mailbox_hacking_program_can_exha" title="Figure 2-5. A voice mailbox hacking program can exhaustively try different combinations of numbers until it finds one that accesses a voice mailbox.">Figure 2-5</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0061" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_voice_mailbox_hacking_program_can_exha"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1317"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676467.png.jpg" alt="A voice mailbox hacking program can exhaustively try different combinations of numbers until it finds one that accesses a voice mailbox."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-5. A voice mailbox hacking program can exhaustively try different combinations of numbers until it finds one that accesses a voice mailbox.</p></div><p>With access to an existing voice mailbox, a phone phreaker can listen to messages and learn more about a particular person or company in order to gather information that may be useful later for prying deeper into a particular company's computer systems.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0065" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In addition, most voice mail systems have several empty mailboxes at any given time, either leftovers from previous employees or extra capacity for anticipated newcomers, and phone phreakers can take over these empty mailboxes and set up a virtual presence for themselves within an unsuspecting corporation. And, if the voice mail system provides a toll-free number, the phone phreaker can receive free phone messages from anywhere.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Even if the voice mail system doesn't offer a toll-free number, phone phreakers can often reprogram the voice mail system to forward their calls anywhere in the world, essentially getting long-distance phone service at the hacked company's expense.</p></div><p>The simplest way to defeat voice mailbox hacking is to turn off call forwarding, which will make the system a less inviting target for phone phreakers. Next, make sure that unused mailboxes are really empty, and have no outgoing message.</p><p>Despite these precautions, voice mailbox hacking is relatively straightforward, and even changing passwords frequently will do nothing more than delay a hacker by forcing him or her to find a new mailbox to attack and take over. As a result, many companies simply ignore or tolerate this minor transgression. As long as the hackers don't mess up the voice mail system for legitimate users, it's often cheaper to simply pretend they don't exist on the system at all.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Hacking VoIP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hacking_voip"/>Hacking VoIP</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the early tactics of phone phreakers no longer work on today's telephone systems, phone phreaking may soon regain popularity as telephone networks switch to VoIP (voice over Internet protocol), which transfers voice calls partially or entirely over the Internet. Whereas early phone phreakers could redirect phone calls through the telephone company's switches, VoIP phone phreakers will be able to access, intercept, and manipulate the actual voices, which are stored in data packets when they are transferred on phone calls across the Internet.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0066" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0068" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0069" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For example, programs like Vomit (<a class="ulink" href="http://vomit.xtdnet.nl">http://vomit.xtdnet.nl</a>), which stands for Voice Over Misconfigured Internet Telephones, or Cain &amp; Abel (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.oxid.it">www.oxid.it</a>) can snare data packets from a VoIP conversation and convert them to audio files so you can eavesdrop on VoIP phone calls, just like in the early days of the telephone system when teenage boys listened in on supposedly private phone calls. Of course, VoIP phone phreakers will likely follow the same path as their predecessors and end up not only listening to other people's phone calls, but disrupting them as well.</p><p>By accessing individual voice data packets, VoIP phone phreakers can inject their own data packets into a VoIP phone call, including profanity or other words that will change the nature of the call. For example, the speaker might say something as simple as "How are Madge and the kids?" but the person on the other end would hear the original sentence plus any profanity or other comments that the VoIP phone phreaker added. You can imagine the possibilities.</p><p>Inserting individual VoIP voice data packets into a conversation may be annoying, but more serious is that phone phreakers could block a valid phone call and replace it with a completely different one. The speaker thinks he's saying one thing but the listener hears something else. Since every VoIP call gets routed across the Internet through multiple computers, it's possible for hackers to break into a computer, intercept all VoIP phone calls, and modify the voice messages as they pass by.</p><p>By capturing voice data packets and editing them within an audio editing program, phone phreakers can fabricate entire messages and leave them on an unsuspecting victim's voice mail. The victim will hear what seems to be the voice of a trusted person, but the message may be something that the caller never said.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Caller ID spoofing</em></span>, whereby VoIP phreakers can mask their true phone number and impersonate another phone number, is even simpler. Spoofing caller ID can trick people into answering telemarketer phone calls, or can make the phone line of identity thieves appear to come from a credible business or organization like eBay or the Red Cross.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0070" class="indexterm"/></p><p>By following the trail of data packets, VoIP phone phreakers could even trace a phone call from one person to another, which could come in handy for finding someone else's phone number. For example, if you were to tap into the VoIP phone of a known drug dealer, you could trace his calls to find the phone numbers of his suppliers (or contacts with corrupt police officers), or tap into a movie star agent's VoIP network to find the phone numbers of his clients (then eavesdrop on his phone calls and sell any juicy gossip to the entertainment tabloids, much like the reporter who recorded cell phone conversations between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).</p><p>Just as email has allowed people to send spam for free, so will VoIP allow phone phreakers to hijack a VoIP network and flood it with <span class="emphasis"><em>spam over Internet telephony (SPIT)</em></span>. So not only will people receive spam in their email accounts, but with VoIP, they'll also risk getting telemarketing calls to their voice mailboxes too.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0071" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Or, if phone phreakers simply want to annoy people, they can flood a network with bogus data, creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>clipping</em></span> attack, which can disrupt or "clip" your phone calls so people can only hear every second or third word spoken. A more malicious phone phreaker might opt for <span class="emphasis"><em>V-bombing</em></span>, which floods a voice mailbox to prevent someone from receiving valid messages.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0072" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0073" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In the old days, shutting down the entire telephone network of a major corporation, like Monsanto or Halliburton, used to require understanding of how the phone network worked. But with more corporations relying on VoIP phone networks, shutting down a phone system requires little more than a simple <span class="emphasis"><em>denial of service (DoS)</em></span> attack that floods the network with more data than it can handle, effectively blocking all phone service along with other Internet transmissions. For a more subtle approach, phone phreakers could selectively block the ports used to make VoIP phone calls so that, while the rest of the phone system appears to work properly, certain people wouldn't be able to make calls or receive them.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0074" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0075" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0079" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0080" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, phone phreakers aren't the only threat. Vonage, an early VoIP provider, has had its service disrupted by two broadband providers, Madison River and Clearwire, that saw its service as a potential competitor. Madison River blocked all Vonage VoIP calls until the Federal Communications Commission fined it $15,000. Clearwire also blocked Vonage VoIP calls, but Vonage simply developed technical workarounds to avoid the digital blockade.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0081" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0082" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0083" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This Vonage vs. Madison River/Clearwire battle isn't likely the only fight occurring between VoIP providers and Internet service providers. If phone phreakers want to get paid to hack the phone system, they might find the greatest demand for their services coming from broadband providers who want to "discourage" customers from switching to VoIP services in lieu of the broadband provider's own telephone services. VoIP has come under attack from governments that want to protect their monopolies over state-run telephone service, too. For example, Costa Rica's Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) tried to regulate VoIP as part of its national telephone service, and other nations are likely to do the same.</p><p>Even the FBI sees VoIP as a threat. The agency claims, ironically, that it will be much harder to wiretap VoIP calls than traditional phone calls, and so VoIP could become a "haven for criminals, terrorists, and spies." (While computer security experts warn that VoIP is <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> prone to eavesdropping, the FBI claims just the opposite. Go figure.)</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>For more on VoIP security, visit Voice over IP Security Alliance at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.voipsa.org">www.voipsa.org</a>.</p></div><p>As VoIP phone networks become more popular, their simplicity reduces our dependence on traditional landlines and cellular phone networks as well. After all, why pay for minutes on a cell phone calling plan when you can make that same phone call over a VoIP phone for a fixed monthly rate? Perhaps all the phone phreaking tricks previously done on cell phones will trickle down to mobile VoIP phones too.</p><p>Like cell phones, you can't trust VoIP to keep your conversation private or even connect you to the phone number you dialed. But at least your long-distance phone charges should decrease, which makes avoiding long-distance phone calling charges one of the few phone phreaking techniques that VoIP probably won't revitalize.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest threat to VoIP isn't protecting your privacy but in providing you with service in the first place. Unlike landline phone service that runs on a separate power grid, VoIP phone service depends on the Internet and computers to remain running. If a power outage occurs, through natural disasters or deliberate sabotage, guess what? A landline phone system may still work, but a VoIP phone system will be dead. With VoIP, the simplest denial of service attack you can do is simply finding a way to pull the plug.</p></div></div>

</span></span></div></div><p>Hacking is more than just manipulating computers. As phone phreakers discovered in their quest to control the telephone system, hacking can be performed on anything, and as you'll soon see, people have been hacking in a variety of ways for years. Hacking involves studying a system to see how it works, playing with the system to see how to control it, and then manipulating the system to put it under your control.</p><div class="sect1" title="Social Engineering: The Art of Hacking People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="social_engineering_colon_the_art_of_hack"/>Social Engineering: The Art of Hacking People</h1></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the oldest form of hacking is <span class="emphasis"><em>social engineering</em></span>, which involves using people to get what you want. Unlike con games that steal money, social engineering steals information. But since social engineering victims are unaware that they have been tricked, they're often willing to help the same person who fooled them again and again. (Politicians are probably the ultimate social engineers.)</p><p>Say, for example, a hacker wants someone's password at a particular company. Rather than ask that person directly (which would probably fail), he might try a more easily manipulated source, such as a secretary. The hacker could deliberately foul up a computer at that company, then call the secretary (while masquerading as a technician), and ask if she has noticed any problems with the computer. When the secretary says yes, the "technician" claims that fixing the problem requires the (desired) password. More often than not, the secretary will give out this password and the "technician" will fix the very problem that he created in the first place. The computer problem "mysteriously" disappears and the secretary thinks that everything is now okay, not realizing that she has just given her boss's password to a hacker. The secretary suffers no loss, and the password's owner is unaware that it's been stolen.</p><p>Rather than go through another person, hackers might social engineer a target directly. For example, a hacker might discover the phone number to a corporate technical support line, then reroute those calls to herself. When the target finds that his computer is suddenly not working, he calls technical support. The hacker answers the line and asks for the target's password. Since the target initiated the call, he will likely supply any information requested just to get his computer working again. Once the target gives the hacker the password, the hacker "fixes" the computer, and the problem once again "mysteriously" disappears. The hacker has succeeded in obtaining the password, and the target never realizes that he gave it away.</p><div class="sect2" title="Studying a target"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="studying_a_target"/>Studying a target</h2></div></div></div><p>Social engineering can be particularly effective for gathering bits of information a little at a time. While hackers could social engineer people without knowing anything about them, the company they work for, or the type of job they do, studying a target before trying to social engineer anyone will likely gather much more useful information.</p><p>One favorite tactic for researching a target is <span class="emphasis"><em>dumpster diving</em></span>. As the name implies, this activity involves digging through a company's trash bins for valuable tidbits of information, such as out-of-date phone directories (which can provide names, phone numbers, and department names), business cards (which can match names with titles and departments), and handwritten notes (which can reveal passwords or current project names).<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Dumpster diving helps a hacker plan the best way to launch an attack without the target ever being aware of the hacker's existence. However, in some cases, dumpster diving may not yield enough information. In those cases, hackers might take the riskier path of dressing up as janitors, temporary workers, or new employees and physically wandering around the premises, noting what they see and where equipment is located. If this surveillance takes place after hours or during lunch, hackers can even peek inside workers' desks and examine computers. With physical access, hackers can try to access a network from a trusted computer, or install a keystroke logging program to snare the users' passwords as they type them in (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Cracking Passwords">Chapter 9</a> for more about these techniques).</p><p>Since visiting a targeted company in person may be too risky or impractical for some hackers (a 13-year-old is likely to have trouble masquerading as a temporary employee), hackers might call certain people either to get information from them or to discover the names of others who can provide the information.</p><p>When talking on the phone, hackers often disguise their voices and play different characters. Thus, a hacker might use multiple voices to call the same worker so the victim thinks she's providing information to a different person each time. (Few workers will be suspicious of ten different people calling for information, but the same person calling repeatedly would definitely arouse suspicion.)</p><p>Armed with one bit of personal information about a target, a hacker can often prowl the Internet and pick up additional bits of information about people, from their personal web pages, to their posted resumes on job-hunting sites like <a class="ulink" href="http://monster.com">Monster.com</a>, to their biography listed under a corporate web page. The more information a hacker gathers about a target, the more likely he'll appear "credible" and successfully social engineer the target out of valuable information.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Gaining familiarity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="gaining_familiarity"/>Gaining familiarity</h2></div></div></div><p>The key to social engineering is to gain the trust of others. This is often accomplished by acknowledging, rather than questioning, the target's position or authority and developing a rapport with the target. For example, hassled secretaries are unlikely to answer questions from a total stranger, but once the hacker develops a rapport with him or her (perhaps by making fun of his own boss in a way that the secretary might relate to), the hacker can erase any suspicions. This works especially well if the hacker can toss out the names of important people, projects, or procedures with the familiarity of someone who has worked at or with the company for several years.</p><p>Having established a rapport, the social engineer next asks the victim for help. Since helping others—especially someone perceived as trustworthy—can make people feel important, most victims of social engineering will willingly give the hacker the requested information. The victim doesn't feel like he or she is really losing anything; the hacker has only asked for information after all, not something tangible like money.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0002" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Hackers rarely ask for information point blank. Instead, they obfuscate their true purpose with casual requests for assistance and friendly small talk. For example, a hacker might complain to a secretary about the company's working conditions, casually mention that he's in building F (which anyone at the company would know is isolated from the rest of the company's buildings), then suddenly remark that he forgot his password back at his desk, which is way across the parking lot in another building. He may ask the victim if she knows another password that he could borrow for the moment. The victim will volunteer someone else's password or, more likely, just give her own. Either way, the hacker now has what he wanted.</p><p>At this point, the hacker could just hang up and yell, "SUCKER!!!!" However, he doesn't want to arouse suspicion, so he might chat a little more about the company and the people involved, and then complete whatever task he needed the password for in the first place.</p><p>Social engineering victims rarely learn that they've been victimized. Even if people later learn that someone broke into the computer network using a stolen password, the social engineering victim usually believes that he or she gave the password to help an employee rather than a hacker. As a result, the hacker can often victimize the same target repeatedly.</p><p>If you can be fooled by a magician's sleight of hand, you can be fooled by social engineering. In fact, chances are good that you have already fallen victim to social engineering and don't even know it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The keys to social engineering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_keys_to_social_engineering"/>The keys to social engineering</h2></div></div></div><p>Social engineering works because it's a low-risk activity. If the hacker asks for a password and someone refuses or even gets suspicious, the hacker can just hang up and ask somebody else. No matter how suspicious targets may get, they'll never be able to find the hacker. Even if they go to the trouble of tracing the hacker's phone number, authorities can't arrest him or her because no crime has been committed. Even with the longest odds, given enough time, the hacker will always succeed.</p><p>Another reason that social engineering works so well is that it involves an indirect attack, which allows the hacker to avoid raising suspicion and cover his or her tracks. No one is likely to connect a computer break-in with three different phone calls made to three different people on three different days. You can't stop social engineering with a firewall, and given the large number of people in any company, it's not just possible that one person will fall victim to social engineering aren't just good; it's guaranteed.</p><p>Many large corporations now offer ongoing educational programs warning workers of common social engineering tactics. Still, no matter how many employees resist a social engineer, it only takes one to fall victim for the hacker to succeed.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Picking Locks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="picking_locks"/>Picking Locks</h1></div></div></div><p>Show a hacker a locked door and the first thing he wants to do is find out what's on the other side. Whether the door is hiding a janitor's closet, a half-constructed restroom, or a vault containing gold and jewelry is irrelevant. Hackers want to get to the other side, and a locked door just gets in their way. And, not surprisingly, many hackers are equally proficient at breaking into computers and picking physical locks.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Most physical locks succeed in preventing entry not because they're mechanically complicated, but because people don't know how they work. A locked screen door can stop a two-year-old baby just as effectively as a locked car door can defeat most adults, although a knowledgeable locksmith or car thief can unlock most car doors with a metal Slim Jim within seconds. Given their mindset, it shouldn't come as a surprise that hackers also enjoy picking locks.</p><div class="sect2" title="The theory of lockpicking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_theory_of_lockpicking"/>The theory of lockpicking</h2></div></div></div><p>There are several ways to pick a lock. At the crudest level, you could use brute-force and just keep smashing it with a hammer until it breaks open. At the other extreme, you could find an unexpected trick to open the lock, the way people discovered they could pick the Kryptonite Evolution 2000 U-Lock (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kryptonitelock.com">www.kryptonitelock.com</a>) by jamming the top of an ordinary ballpoint pen into its keyhole. (The company later corrected this glaring flaw, but not before considerable embarrassment; you can see a how-to video here: <a class="ulink" href="http://media.weblogsinc.com/common/videos/pt/lock.wmv">http://media.weblogsinc.com/common/videos/pt/lock.wmv</a>.)<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, rather than attack a lock directly, it's often easier to attack the much weaker area around it. For example, while you could pick the lock on the anti–car theft device the Club, it's simpler to break the steering wheel, slide the Club off, and then drive the car away with a broken steering wheel, bypassing the security of the Club altogether.</p><p>Similarly, spring locks (such as those typically found guarding office doors) can often be picked by sliding a credit card or other thin tool to push the latch open without bothering to pick the lock open at all.</p><p>To pick a lock, you must first understand how that particular lock works. Although there are many different types of lock designs, the most common is a pin-and-tumbler design, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#a_pin-and-tumbler_design_uses_pins_that" title="Figure 3-1. A pin-and-tumbler design uses pins that drop down to hold a lock in place.">Figure 3-1</a>.</p><p>This design holds a lock shut using five or six pins, with each pin split into two halves. Springs push both halves of the pins downward to prevent the plug from turning. When you insert a key into the plug, the jagged ridges of the key push up each pin so that the breaks in each pin lie flush with the top of the plug. Once all of the pin halves are aligned, you can turn the plug to open the lock. So to pick a pin-and-tumbler lock you push up all the pins, and hold them in place until you can turn the plug.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The tools and techniques"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_tools_and_techniques"/>The tools and techniques</h2></div></div></div><p>Two common lockpicking tools are the <span class="emphasis"><em>pick</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>tension wrench</em></span>. The pick (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#a_pick_pushes_up_each_pin_so_that_it_res" title="Figure 3-2. A pick pushes up each pin so that it rests on the edge (or ridge) of the plug.">Figure 3-2</a>) looks like a dentist's tool. The tension wrench can be as simple as a flathead screwdriver and is used to turn the plug once all the pin breaks are aligned with the plug.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_pin-and-tumbler_design_uses_pins_that"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1608"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676469.png.jpg" alt="A pin-and-tumbler design uses pins that drop down to hold a lock in place."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-1. A pin-and-tumbler design uses pins that drop down to hold a lock in place.</p></div><p>To pick a lock, you use the pick to push up each pin until the break between its two halves is flush with the plug. If a pin isn't held in place, it will fall back down, so lockpickers twist the plug slightly to one side to create a ridge. Once the lockpicker has pushed the halves of a single pin flush with the plug, a slight twist pushes the pin sideways so that, instead of falling back in place (and locking), the tip of the pin half rests on the ridge of the twisted plug as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#a_pick_pushes_up_each_pin_so_that_it_res" title="Figure 3-2. A pick pushes up each pin so that it rests on the edge (or ridge) of the plug.">Figure 3-2</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_pick_pushes_up_each_pin_so_that_it_res"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1623"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676471.png.jpg" alt="A pick pushes up each pin so that it rests on the edge (or ridge) of the plug."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-2. A pick pushes up each pin so that it rests on the edge (or ridge) of the plug.</p></div><p>The lockpicker repeats this step for each pin until one half of each pin lies on the slight ridge created by twisting the plug to one side. Once this is achieved, the lockpicker twists the tension wrench to mimic a key and opens the lock.</p><p>While simple in concept, it takes practice to pick a lock, and it's tricky to feel (or hear) when each pin is properly positioned. Lockpickers sometimes use a faster technique called <span class="emphasis"><em>raking</em></span>, in which they twist the plug while they brush or rake a pick under the pins to push them all up in one quick motion. This usually results in pushing one or more pin halves up to rest on the ridge of the plug, at which point the lockpicker needs to push up only the remaining pins individually to open the lock.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Experienced lockpickers often carry a variety of different size picks for different types of locks. Some use an electric pick gun, which vibrates to push up the pins as the plug is twisted.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can buy lockpicking books and tools from a variety of websites, one of which is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#you_can_buy_lockpicking_tools_and_instru" title="Figure 3-3. You can buy lockpicking tools and instruction books online.">Figure 3-3</a>.

<div class="sect1" title="Exploring Urban Areas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="exploring_urban_areas"/>Exploring Urban Areas</h1></div></div></div><p>Rather than pay to visit an amusement park and absorb its sanitized experiences, many hackers prefer the excitement and unpredictability of exploring the buildings around them for free. Urban explorers often tour abandoned buildings for their historical value (shut-down subway tunnels, empty factories, boarded-up hotels, or abandoned missile silos). They also enjoy prowling around buildings currently in use, such as utility tunnels beneath a convention center, the roofs of warehouses, or construction sites. If the general public would normally never see it, the urban explorer wants to be there.</p><p>Although the idea of crawling through an old sewage pipe or wading through stagnant water in the bottom of an abandoned mine shaft might not sound appealing, it's no more uncomfortable than camping in a forest and enduring mosquito bites, bird droppings, and primitive toilet facilities (or spending five days a week in a sterile office cubicle, locked in a business suit, with eye-irritating fluorescent lighting, while counting the hours until your escape).</p><p>The urban explorer's goal is to wander and explore as a modern-day archaeologist, admiring the wonders around us. To learn more about the fine art of urban exploring, visit Infiltration Magazine (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.infiltration.org">www.infiltration.org</a>), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#infiltration_magazine_offers_plenty_of_s" title="Figure 3-4. Infiltration Magazine offers plenty of stories and pictures to encourage you on the proper techniques for infiltrating urban areas.">Figure 3-4</a>. This magazine provides urban exploring tips that range from the plainly practical (wear comfortable clothes and thick-soled shoes, and bring a flashlight) to the more obscure (grappling hooks can be handy for scaling buildings but impractical to hide if confronted by a security guard).<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="infiltration_magazine_offers_plenty_of_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1692"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676475.png.jpg" alt="Infiltration Magazine offers plenty of stories and pictures to encourage you on the proper techniques for infiltrating urban areas."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-4. Infiltration Magazine offers plenty of stories and pictures to encourage you on the proper techniques for infiltrating urban areas.</p></div><p>The goal of urban exploration isn't to steal or deface anything, but simply to look around, even if that involves a little bit of trespassing. Sometimes this might require social engineering (to get past a security guard or to avoid arrest when confronted by one), a little bit of stamina (to climb stairs or crawl through holes in walls), and a lot of problem solving (to figure out how to cross an I-beam three stories up without falling so that you can escape from aggressive guard dogs).</p><p>Urban exploring can prove embarrassing (and useful) to governments. For example, the Russian urban exploring group Diggers of the Underground Planet once found a secret subway system under Moscow that Stalin reportedly had built to allow government authorities a quick escape from the city in an emergency. The acquired knowledge of these same urban explorers came in handy in October 2002, when Chechen rebels took over a Moscow theater and held more than 900 people hostage. Vadim Mikhailov of the Diggers of the Underground Planet led Russian authorities to the theater through a little-known underground route, of which neither the rebels nor the authorities were even aware.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Whether urban explorers want to see the employee lounge in the basement of a five-star hotel or map out the steam tunnels beneath a college campus, the goal is to have fun, see something cool that can be talked about later, and get back in one piece to do it again.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Hacking the Airwaves"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hacking_the_airwaves"/>Hacking the Airwaves</h1></div></div></div><p>In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fcc.gov">www.fcc.gov</a>—is a government agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. You aren't allowed to broadcast anything unless you get FCC approval for a given frequency. Regulation can prevent equipment and radio signals from interfering with each other, but critics claim it also gives the FCC the power to deny ordinary people permission to broadcast information while granting the same right to corporations. Regulation of the airwaves can effectively translate into censorship, as demonstrated in countries such as China and Cuba.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To fight back against blatant censorship or corporate-regulated radio broadcasting, some people have created <span class="emphasis"><em>pirate radio stations</em></span> to broadcast music, news, and information without their government's approval. Pirate radio stations often operate secretly (until the authorities shut them down) or semi-legally. A handful of British pirate radio stations once broadcasted from ships anchored just outside British territorial waters, thereby skirting British laws regulating broadcasting. (Of course, British law made it illegal for people to <span class="emphasis"><em>listen</em></span> to these same pirate broadcasts, but at least the stations could operate with impunity.)<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0019" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Radio stations along the borders of countries that regulate radio broadcasts often skirt the laws of the countries that receive their broadcasts. For example, Mexican radio stations routinely broadcast English-language programs at 250,000 watts, far in excess of the 50,000 watts allowed by FCC regulations. Then again, the United States has no qualms about breaking other countries' laws by broadcasting its Voice of America radio programs into Cuba, Vietnam, and China. As always, the legality of anything depends solely on what's being done and who's doing it, regardless of their reasons why.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0020" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Rather than hassle with bulky transmitters and run the risk of upsetting the authorities, many people are turning to their personal computers and audio files (typically MP3 files) to broadcast information they want to share. By sending streaming audio across the Internet, wannabe radio broadcasters can broadcast anything to the world without breaking any laws. (Of course, they may still be breaking the free speech laws of their government, but that's another story.) <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#with_a_personal_computer_and_a_program_l" title="Figure 3-5. With a personal computer and a program like Pirate Radio, anyone can broadcast audio information over the Internet.">Figure 3-5</a> shows an advertisement for a program called Pirate Radio (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pirateradio.com">www.pirateradio.com</a>) that can broadcast your audio files around the world to anyone who cares to listen.</p><p>In fact, you can even turn an ordinary iPod into a pirate radio transmitter. iPod pirate radio broadcasters simply load up their iPod with audio files, attach a transmitter, and drive around with a bumper sticker advertising the frequency on which they're transmitting. Anyone can tune their car radios to this frequency and hear the iPod pirate radio broadcast—until the driver pulls too far away and the signal disappears.</p><p>Some popular iPod FM transmitters include iTrip (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.griffintechnology.com">www.griffintechnology.com</a>), TuneFM (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.belkin.com">www.belkin.com</a>), and iRadio (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ipodworld.co.uk">www.ipodworld.co.uk</a>).</p><p>Rather than broadcast on an unused frequency, some iPod pirate radio stations prefer to hijack a currently used frequency, such as that used by a local rap music station. When a car stops at an intersection with its windows rolled down and rap music blaring from its speakers, the nearby iPod pirate radio broadcaster simply fires up the music and hijacks the rap music station's frequency. Instead of hearing rap, the offending driver may now hear Barry Manilow, John Tesh, Yanni, or whatever other music the iPod owner decides to transmit blaring from his or her car speakers, instead.</p><div class="figure"><a id="with_a_personal_computer_and_a_program_l"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1764"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676477.png.jpg" alt="With a personal computer and a program like Pirate Radio, anyone can broadcast audio information over the Internet."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-5. With a personal computer and a program like Pirate Radio, anyone can broadcast audio information over the Internet.</p></div><p>Even simpler are <span class="emphasis"><em>podcasts</em></span>, prerecorded MP3 audio files stored on a website that anyone can download and listen to at their convenience.

There's a big difference between what really happened in the past and what authorities think or say (or wish) really happened. As a result, history, seemingly built on a rock-solid foundation of facts, actually consists of nothing more than selective facts mixed in with educated and not-so-educated guesses.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0030" class="indexterm"/></p><p>History is malleable and can be changed to suit a government's needs. If you're going to start thinking like a hacker, begin by questioning the biggest assumptions of all: what your schools, culture, teachers, parents, churches, and history books may tell you about the past.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Japanese textbook controversy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_japanese_textbook_controversy"/>The Japanese textbook controversy</h2></div></div></div><p>The Japanese government has a problem. On one hand, they want to teach history to Japanese students, but on the other hand, they are less than enthusiastic about reporting what the Japanese government did to China, Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Thailand, and practically every other country they fought or conquered during World War II. After all, why would the Japanese government want to tell its schoolchildren that the Japanese imprisoned armies of Korean women to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers? Or that its military beheaded, raped, and massacred thousands of Chinese civilians in the city of Nanking, to the point where a Nazi Party representative even appealed to Adolf Hitler to stop the atrocities?<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0036" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>To this day, the Japanese government refuses to acknowledge the atrocities in Nanking. Without knowing this little bit of trivia, you couldn't fully understand the nature of current Japanese and Chinese relations, which would probably place you at the same level of ignorance regarding Asian foreign affairs as the average American member of Congress.</p></div><p>If a nation's citizens learn potentially troubling facts about previous administrations, could that undermine their confidence and faith in the current government? Perhaps, and that's what makes history textbooks so important in shaping the thinking of future generations. Richard H. Minear, a professor of Japanese history at the University of Massachusetts and the author of the books <span class="emphasis"><em>Victor's Justice: The Tokyo War Crimes</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Seuss Goes to War</em></span>, answers the question this way: "As a practicing historian, I encounter at every turn the power textbooks exercise over my students' minds . . . our students believe absolutely what they read in textbooks."</p><p>Fujioka Nobukatsu, a professor of education at Tokyo University, decided to "correct history" by emphasizing a "positive view" of Japan's past and removing any textbook references to what he calls "dark history." Fujioka formed the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tsukurukai.com">www.tsukurukai.com</a>), which published <span class="emphasis"><em>The New History Textbook</em></span>. This textbook ignited controversy in China, North and South Korea, and even in Japan itself with claims that the Japanese military tried to liberate Asia from Western colonization during World War II, as the following excerpt shows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>When Japanese troops occupied in 1942, having defeated Dutch forces, Indonesians lined the roads and cheered. Japanese forces were a liberating army to rid them of the Dutch. During the occupation, which lasted three and a half years, the Japanese trained PETA, a military force, opened middle schools, and established a common language. The many reforms implemented served as a foundation for future independence. But when war neared its end and food was scarce, Japanese military police sometimes forced locals to do harsh labor, and were cruel to the local people in other ways as well.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Hiding history to protect the present"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hiding_history_to_protect_the_present"/>Hiding history to protect the present</h2></div></div></div><p>Rewritten history can not only reinterpret the past, but also erase it altogether.

By watching these films, you can get an idea of how people used to live and think.</p><p>But perhaps more stunning are the various propaganda films that the American government produced against the Japanese (during World War II when the Chinese were our friends) and against the Chinese (during the Korean War when the Japanese were our friends). Paramount Pictures even created a Superman cartoon called <span class="emphasis"><em>Eleventh Hour</em></span>, in which Superman sneaks into a Japanese World War II shipyard and sabotages the Japanese war effort.
