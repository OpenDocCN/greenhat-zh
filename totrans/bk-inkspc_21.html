Inkscape is a drawing program—and as such, its 3D Box tool is best used as a <span class="emphasis"><em>drawing aid</em></span>. This is what we’ll try to do in this simple tutorial.</p><p>A “3D-correct” drawing is simply one that satisfies the rules of perspective drawing which have been well known to artists for many centuries. It does not need to exhibit perfectly realistic shading and texturing; it just has to get its lines and objects approximately correct with regard to angles and dimensions.</p><p>Granted, some styles of drawing do not even need to have correct perspective; sometimes, intentional perspective distortions may have an artistic value of its own. Many artists have a knack for drawing 3D-correct art without using any technical aids. However, quite often you will notice perspective errors, ranging from barely noticeable to embarrassing, in pieces of art which would definitely do better without them. I think, therefore, that many artists—not only the beginners—would appreciate a quick and easy way to set up the perspective for a drawing without tedious manual measurements and helper lines. Let’s see how this task can be approached in Inkscape.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="21.1 The Room"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two1dot1_the_room"/>21.1 The Room</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1080" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4901" class="indexterm"/>Let’s say we want to draw a simple scene of a meeting of two people in a room. Switch to the 3D Box tool (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00810"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735806.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and drag in the middle of the canvas to draw the box for the room:</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_the_room"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00381"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736424.png.jpg" alt="Creating the room"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-1. Creating the room</p></div><p>Don’t try to get it right on the first try; instead, just drag the handles of the box and, if necessary, the vanishing points to adjust what you’ve drawn. The corner handles will let you resize your room; the four X/Y handles move in the X/Y plane by default and along the Z axis when <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00811"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> is pressed, whereas the four Z handles, conversely, will move along the Z axis without <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00812"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and in the X/Y plane with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00813"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. The X-shaped central handle will move the entire room, again in the X/Y plane without <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00814"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and along the Z axis with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00815"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. Whenever moving a handle in X/Y, press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00816"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to restrict its movement to only X or only Y axis. Finally, dragging the vanishing points will reslant and resize the room to fit the changed perspective (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#one1dot3dot3_perspective_and_vanishing_p" title="11.3.3 Perspective and Vanishing Points">11.3.3 Perspective and Vanishing Points</a></strong></span>).</p><p>You can create a third vanishing point on the Y axis in addition to the existing ones in X and Z (in other words, make Y vanishing point <span class="emphasis"><em>finite</em></span>). Do this if you want your image to look “closer” and from a more emphatic perspective, as if viewed by a spider in the corner of the room instead of a human at a distance. Conversely, you can make two or three of the vanishing points infinite if what you’re after is a more detached, technical look “from afar”:</p><div class="figure"><a id="different_kinds_of_perspective"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00382"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736426.png.jpg" alt="Different kinds of perspective"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-2. Different kinds of perspective</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="21.2 The Furniture"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two1dot2_the_furniture"/>21.2 The Furniture</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1073" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1835" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3514" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4189" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4196" class="indexterm"/>Next up, let’s add some furniture—for example, a sofa.</p><p>In creating 3D box compositions, it is convenient to use snapping (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html" title="7.3 Snapping">7.3 Snapping</a></strong></span>) so that boxes align precisely. Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Document Properties</strong></span> dialog (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00817"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735646.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and, on the <span class="strong"><strong>Snap</strong></span> tab, enable both <span class="strong"><strong>Snap to paths</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Snap to nodes</strong></span>.</p><p>Now, draw a smaller box inside the larger one. (We don’t need to worry about z-order of the boxes; their default style uses partial transparency so you can always see the edges of all boxes you created.) Note that the new box uses the same perspective (i.e., the same vanishing points) as the room box. Grab its lower left X/Y handle and drag it so it snaps to the lower left Z-edge of the room. That will be the foundation of the sofa; use the other corner handles to give it correct height, width, and depth:</p><div class="figure"><a id="foundation_of_the_sofa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00383"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736428.png.jpg" alt="The foundation of the sofa"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-3. The foundation of the sofa</p></div><p>For the back of the sofa, you can draw a new box and snap it into alignment in a similar way; or, more easily, you can duplicate the sofa base (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00818"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and drag its X/Y handles to resize it into the correct shape:</p><div class="figure"><a id="back_of_the_sofa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00384"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736430.png.jpg" alt="The back of the sofa"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-4. The back of the sofa</p></div><p>Now, assuming this is a basement, let’s place two small basement windows on both sides of the sofa. A couple of boxes flattened in the X dimension will make perfect windows. However, how do we properly place them, given that no side of a window aligns with a side of any other box?</p><p>Again, the duplicate-then-resize trick is the easiest way to achieve this. Duplicate the largest box you have (i.e., the room itself); <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00819"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag its front X/Y handle backward (along the X axis) to squeeze it into a thin layer; then, drag four handles on the X/Y plane to resize the window into place. For a second window, just duplicate the first one and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00820"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag its central handle in the Z direction; this way, the second window will be an exact perspective-aligned copy of the first one. Using the same duplicate and flatten trick, add a doorway box on the Z-most wall (i.e., the wall closest to the Z vanishing point), so that it protrudes outside of the room box:</p><div class="figure"><a id="windows_and_the_door"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00385"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736432.png.jpg" alt="The windows and the door"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-5. The windows and the door</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="21.3 People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two1dot3_people"/>21.3 People</h1></div></div></div><p>Now, I want to draw two people, one standing by the sofa and the other in the doorway. What does the 3D Box tool have to do with drawing humans, you may ask? A lot! Although I’m not going to model robot-like constructions out of parallelepipeds, I still want to make sure the height and bulkiness of a figure are correct in the drawing’s perspective, and an easy way to achieve this is with the 3D Box tool.</p><p>Here’s what I do. First, I add a tall and narrow box in the doorway—this will be our human number 1. As before, I just duplicate the doorway box, squeeze it on the sides in the X/Y plane, and resize it so as to get a realistic proportion of the figure height and doorway height. (Ask someone to stand in a real doorway to get an idea.)</p><p>Then, I duplicate the first human box and, using its X-shaped handle in the middle, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00821"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag it to the front, then <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00822"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag it horizontally a bit along the X axis. This will be our second human standing beside the sofa.</p><div class="figure"><a id="two_people"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00386"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736434.png.jpg" alt="The two people"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-6. The two people</p></div><p><a id="iddle1432" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4142" class="indexterm"/>This way, both people boxes have the same perspective-adjusted height and will serve as useful guides for actually drawing the human figures. If I were trying to achieve even better anatomic fidelity, I could use a stack of three boxes for the legs, body, and head for each human (unfortunately, however, you cannot drag several selected boxes in 3D space at once. You can only drag them one-byone in the current version of Inkscape).</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="21.4 Sketching and Coloring"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two1dot4_sketching_and_coloring"/>21.4 Sketching and Coloring</h1></div></div></div><p>Enough boxes; it is time to put away the 3D Box tool, arm yourself with the Calligraphic pen, and start sketching on top the 3D blueprint. Create a new layer so you can show and hide the 3D boxes and the actual drawing separately.</p><p>Of course you don’t need to trace the edges of the boxes precisely. For nongeometric objects, such as the sofa and the humans, this is hardly possible, but even the walls and windows will benefit from some hand-drawn roughness and imperfections. Use the edges of the 3D boxes as general guides to keep an eye on, but otherwise draw as freely as you would draw without any guides at all, using your own manner and style of sketching. You also don’t need to trace <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the lines; some can be omitted, and some just hinted at by short partial strokes.</p><div class="figure"><a id="sketching_over_the_3d_blueprint"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00387"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736436.png.jpg" alt="Sketching over the 3D blueprint"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-7. Sketching over the 3D blueprint</p></div><p>You will discover that the 3D boxes make it much easier to keep in mind the overall composition and space relationships in your drawing while working on the details. I have described my own sketching style with the Calligraphic pen in another tutorial (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch20s06.html" title="20.6 Hatching">20.6 Hatching</a></strong></span>), so I won’t go into much detail here; since the focus of this tutorial is the use of the 3D Box tool, in this drawing I am even more sketchy than usual. Don’t try to copy me; you should try to work out a style which is most natural for you. After you’re done with the basic outlines, you can turn off the 3D layer to see how your image stands on its own merits, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch21s04.html#when_sketching_is_completecomma_hide_the" title="Figure 21-8. When sketching is complete, hide the 3D layer.">Figure 21-8</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="when_sketching_is_completecomma_hide_the"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00388"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736438.png.jpg" alt="When sketching is complete, hide the 3D layer."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-8. When sketching is complete, hide the 3D layer.</p></div><p><a id="iddle1338" class="indexterm"/>Finally, I colorize the drawing, again using my favorite approach with wide blurred colored strokes underneath the dark crisp outlines:</p><div class="figure"><a id="adding_color"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00389"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736440.png.jpg" alt="Adding color"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-9. Adding color</p></div></div></body></html>
