- en: A programmer once worked on a form letter generation program for a bank. The
    bank wanted to send out a special, personalized letter to its richest 1,000 customers.
    Unfortunately for the programmer, he didn't adequately debug his code. Even worse,
    the bank didn't check the first batch of form letters.
