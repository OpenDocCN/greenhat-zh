    in which a web page is written and thus display the page correctly. Sometimes,
    however, the author of the page may neglect to include the character coding for
    that page in the HTML, in which case your web browser, not knowing that the page
    is prepared in another language, will often open it in the default language of
    your system. The result is a page on which you see nothing but odd combinations
    of symbols and letters that have no meaning. In such cases, try changing the character
    coding in your browser to the language encoding you believe the page is in. Some
    languages employ more than one encoding scheme, so if you’re not sure which one
    the page is prepared in, give each possibility a try. In Firefox, you can make
    your choices by selecting **View** ▸ **Character Encoding**. From the submenu
    there, you can select the appropriate coding for the language of that page.

    more than one character for the pinyin input, a list of possible candidates will

    long ago from China), *hiragana* (the phono-alphabetic system used mainly for
    tense and case endings), and katakana (used mainly for words borrowed from other
    languages). Still, the standard input method for Japanese is primarily via the
    standard Roman keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-function keys. Thus,
    typing in Japanese is a two-step process whereby the IME first converts the romanized
    text into hiragana as it is typed and then converts it to appropriate kanji, katakana,
    or hiragana elements after the spacebar is pressed.'

    IME has already converted the Romanized input on the fly. It has converted rinakkusudenihongonyuuryokugamodekimasu
    (which means *You can input Japanese in* Linux) to hiragana. When a line of hiragana
    is highlighted, it means that the line has not yet been converted beyond that.
    In the second line, however, the user has subsequently pressed the spacebar, which
    caused the IME to convert the hiragana string into the appropriate kanji, hiragana,
    and katakana elements. The first word, *Linux*, has been converted to katakana
    text because it is a borrowed word, while *Japanese input* has been converted
    to kanji; the rest stays in hiragana.

    which are written, as a general rule, clockwise. The IME, therefore, must take
    the input (usually based on a Korean alphabetical keyboard layout) while it is
    being typed, and it must adjust the size, spacing, and positioning of each of
    the letters as it puts them into appropriate clusters (see [Figure 11-10](ch11.html#an_example_of_the_clustering_process_in

    able to install language support for languages other than English and come up
    with a whole new system in a different language. I used to have one machine with
    support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and my default, English, installed. After
    just a few clicks and simply logging out, I could log back in with an interface
    in a totally different language. I could have a Chinese, Japanese, or Swedish
    system whenever I wanted (or whenever a student visiting my office needed).

    same native language. At my former university, for example, where my Japanese
    and Chinese students sometimes used my computer, the additional language support
    allowed them to log in using their own language. It’s even pretty handy if you
    are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself as much exposure as
    possible to it. All in all, it is a very useful feature.

    to do is install a group of support files for each language you want to add to
    your system. You can do this by running Language Support from the Dash and then
    clicking the **Install/Remove Languages** button in that window. When the Installed
    Languages window appears, choose from the various languages available by checking
    the appropriate boxes. ([Figure 11-14](ch11.html#selecting_additional_languages_to_instal
    "Figure 11-14. Selecting additional languages to install")).

    be prompted for your password at this point, so provide what is required, and
    the Language Support tool will begin downloading and then installing the support
    packages you specified. Once it is done, you will be notified and left with the
    Installed Languages window.

    have your system open in a different language environment from the Language Support
    window by selecting the language you want to use when you next log in and dragging
    it to the top of the list ([Figure 11-15](ch11.html#selecting_the_language_in_which_you_want
    "Figure 11-15. Selecting the language in which you want your system to appear
    when you next log in")). For languages with complex input systems, you can also
    select your input method of choice, such as IBus, in the menu button next to the
    words *Keyboard input method system*. You can then close the window, log out,
    and then log in again, after which your system will appear in the language you
    chose.

    usually does. Depending on what language you’ve chosen, once your desktop appears,
    you will be in another linguistic world. Your menus, applications, and even the
    little tips windows that pop up when you run your mouse over a panel icon will
    all be in the newly selected language ([Figure 11-16](ch11.html#portions_of_ubuntu_shown_in_bosnian
