It will also work with AMD64 or Intel Core 2 processors, albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to use Ubuntu with these processors (or any other machine based on AMD64 or EM64T architecture) in 64-bit mode, you must get a different disc on your own. There are a few ways to do this: downloading an ISO (disc image) and then burning it to disc yourself or ordering the disc from an online Linux disc provider.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0148"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0149"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0150"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0151"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0152"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0153"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0154"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0155"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0156"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0157"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0158"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to Disc"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="downloading_and_burning_ubuntu_desktop_c"/>Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to Disc</h1></div></div></div><p>To download an ISO of the 64-bit version of the Ubuntu Desktop disc, go to the Ubuntu website at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a>, find the link to the download page, and then select and download the 64-bit version. Remember that the ISO file you will be downloading is a heavyweight, weighing in at 700MB, so the download will take a bit of time. Don’t count on getting it all downloaded and done before dinner . . . or, if you happen to be using a dial-up Internet connection, before dinner tomorrow.

Although Windows has built-in disc-writing capabilities, not all versions have the built-in ability to burn ISOs. To burn an ISO to disc in Windows 7, just right-click the ISO file, select <span class="strong"><strong>Burn disc image</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button in the window that appears. In all other versions of Windows, however, you must use a third-party commercial application, such as Nero. If you don’t have a commercial disc-burning utility installed on your system, try the free and handy ISO Recorder.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0165"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0166"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0167"/></p><p>To get ISO Recorder, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</a>. Once the download is complete, double-click the <span class="emphasis"><em>ISORecorderSetup.msi</em></span> file on your hard disk to install it. After the installation is finished, burn your ISO to disc by right-clicking the Ubuntu ISO file on your machine and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Open with</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>ISO Recorder</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. A wizard window will appear. Using ISO Recorder is pretty intuitive, but if you like your directions clearly laid out, a set is available online at <a class="ulink" href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/HowTo.htm">http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/HowTo.htm</a>.</p><p>One thing to bear in mind when making your installation discs is that it is generally best to burn installation or live discs at a lower speed than the maximum speed allowed by your drive in order to reduce the chance of error (with 2X to 4X speeds considered optimal). To do so, make your choice from the Recording speed drop-down menu. Next, pop a blank disc into the drive and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button. The CD-burning process should begin. Once it’s done, the CD should pop out of the drive, and if all goes well, you’ll have yourself an AMD64-compatible live CD. You can then use it by following the directions at the beginning of <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a> for using the live CD that comes with this book.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If your CD does not seem to work, there could be a problem with the ISO file you downloaded. Find out by doing an integrity check as explained at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Burning the ISO to Disc in OS X"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="burning_the_iso_to_disc_in_os_x"/>Burning the ISO to Disc in OS X</h2></div></div></div><p>Although Ubuntu no longer comes in PowerPC editions, the i386 editions can be installed and run on Intel-based Macs. You can also, of course, download ISOs for other architectures on your Mac and then burn them to CD for use on other machines.</p><p>To burn an ISO file to CD in OS X, first check to make sure the ISO image is not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disc in the area at the top portion of the left pane. If the disc is mounted, a drive icon will appear in that location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to that entry to eject, or <span class="emphasis"><em>unmount</em></span>, it.</p><p>After that, click <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> in the same Finder window and then look for and open the <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> folder. In that folder, find and then double-click <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Utility</strong></span>. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility window when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD ISO you just downloaded, and drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility window, just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file appears in that list, click it once to highlight it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0168"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0169"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-B-0170"/></p><p>To complete the process, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> icon in the Disk Utility window’s toolbar and, when prompted to do so, insert a blank CD into your drive. Once the blank disc is inserted and recognized, you will be able to adjust the burn speed from the drop-down menu next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Speed</em></span>. Select as low a speed as your hardware will allow, which, depending on the age of your Mac, will probably be 4X to 8X. Finally, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button in that same window, and the burning process will begin.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Ordering an Install Disc from Other Online Sources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ordering_an_install_disc_from_other_onli"/>Ordering an Install Disc from Other Online Sources</h1></div></div></div><p>While it is possible to buy Ubuntu Desktop CDs from the Ubuntu store (<a class="ulink" href="https://shop.canonical.com/">https://shop.canonical.com/</a>), only the 32-bit version is available, which is the same version that comes with this book.
