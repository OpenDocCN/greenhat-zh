    a wireless network signal by at least 15 percent because it can be placed in a
    position free of obstructions to the signal path. The external antenna can be
    attached to either the access point (in which case it will increase signal strength
    to every network client) or to a wireless network adapter. If you can place external
    antennas on both ends of the link, the total improvement will be about 32.5 percent.
  prefs: []

- en: This assumes that the captive antenna and the external antenna have exactly
    the same characteristics. If the external antenna is directional, or if it has
    more gain than the captive antenna, the performance improvement could be even
    greater. On the other hand, many network adapters and access points use two captive
    antennas in a *diversity* system that constantly compares the signals from each
    antenna and selects the stronger one. In a noisy environment, a diversity antenna
    system might be more effective than a single antenna.

    horizontal or the vertical plane, so a receiving antenna will detect a stronger
    signal from an antenna with the same polarity. In other words, if the transmitter
    uses a vertical antenna, the receiving antenna will detect a stronger signal if
    it is also vertical. If the transmitting antenna is horizontal, a horizontal receiving
    antenna will perform best.
  prefs: []

- en: At short range, polarity won't make a significant difference to the performance
    of a Wi-Fi link. Even if the two antennas have different polarity, they will still
    exchange signals that are strong enough to keep the data moving at full speed.
    But when you are trying to squeeze every possible data bit out of a weak or noisy
    signal, you might see some improvement when both antennas are polarized the same
    way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The captive antennas built into most PC Card adapters are difficult or impossible
    to move without turning the whole computer on its side, but many access points

    is probably built into the upper half of the "clamshell" alongside the screen.
    You can sometimes improve wireless performance by changing the angle of the screen
    or by rotating the entire computer on its base. You don't have to make a huge
    adjustment to the screen angle; a slight change can make the difference between
    a poor signal and one you can use.

    to detect all nearby access points and automatically shift their association to
    an access point with a clean, strong signal when you move from one place to another.
    However, the transfers don't always work properly. Sometimes an adapter will just
    drop the network connection when the signal from the nearest access point fades
    out. If that happens, try connecting again. If that doesn't work, try rebooting

- en: The manufacturers of wireless networking hardware (and most other computer-related
    products) often issue new versions of the software that supports their products.
    Updated software might include fixes for bugs that were discovered after the product
    shipped, support for new operating systems, and additional features and functions
    such as improved encryption. Therefore, it's always useful to check the manufacturer's
    website to see what might be available. For updates to wireless broadband data
    adapters, look in the technical support section of your service provider's website.

    software over the older version. In most cases, the manufacturer supplies the
    software in an executable file that automatically deletes earlier versions and
    runs a complete installation routine. It's always a good idea to read the README
    file or other instructions that were provided as part of the download package.

    always includes detailed instructions, which you should follow as closely as possible.
    Before you update the firmware in an access point, remember to warn all your users
    that the network will be offline for maintenance.

    bet is to telephone or email the network manager or help desk staff who are responsible
    for the network. They'll have the exact codes and settings necessary to make your

- en: A radio transmitter consumes electric power as it sends and receives radio signals,
    so the battery in a portable computer with a wireless adapter will run down much
    faster than the same computer without the adapter. Fortunately, there are a few
    things you can do to keep the power drain down to an absolute minimum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, turn off or disconnect the adapter when you're not using it. If you're
    on an airplane or a train, or anywhere else where you're outside the range of
    a wireless signal, or if you're using the computer for some purpose that doesn't
    require network access, remove the PC Card adapter from its socket or unplug the
    USB cable. If your computer has an internal wireless adapter, turn it off.
  prefs: []

- en: This is good advice for any plug-in device on a PC Card. If you're not using
    it, remove it. Modems, Ethernet adapters, and storage cards all consume power
    any time they're plugged into the computer, so your battery will keep going longer
    if the socket is empty.

    response. In PSP mode, the adapter instructs the access point to hold messages
    for this network node in a buffer, and it enters a low-power sleep mode. At regular
    time intervals (several times each minute), the adapter wakes up and polls the
    access point for messages. Because there's a delay between the time the access
    point receives each message and the time it sends the message on to the sleeping
    adapter, data and messages will take longer to move through the network.

- en: An access point is a bridge between a wireless network and a wired LAN. If a
    single access point is not adequate to reach the entire area to be served by the
    wireless network, connecting additional access points to the wired LAN can extend
    the coverage area. But a *wireless bridge*, in which the wireless link connects
    two LANs together, is a more specialized device. Many access points offer wireless
    bridging as an option, but not as part of the basic feature set. If you plan to
    use an access point as a bridge between networks, check the specifications before
    you buy it. Your best bet is to buy a separate wireless bridge rather than trying
    to jury-rig a generic wireless adapter.

    Others are convinced that they're a serious health threat. Scientists and engineers
    have performed studies and published papers that claim to prove that extended
    use of a cell phone can—or can't possibly—cause cancer, make milk go sour, or
    have some other terrible effect. Human exposure to electromagnetic fields at the
    frequencies used by cell phones and wireless network adapters is within the levels
    that most organizations and regulatory agencies that have studied the matter consider
    safe. The dissenters believe that those levels are too high.

- en: Even if you think cell phones are potentially dangerous, it's likely that the
    radios in wireless adapters are safer, for several reasons. First, when a cellular
    telephone is transmitting, it's usually just an inch or two from the user's brain,
    but a wireless adapter is probably a foot or more away (even though they're called
    *laptops*, most people use them on a table rather than on their laps). The effect
    of nonionizing radiation (a fancy name for radio waves) decreases at a rate equal
    to the square of the distance, so a transmitter located two inches from your head
    will have about 36 times more effect on your body than a radio located a foot
    away, assuming that both radio signals are equally strong at the antenna.

    a wireless adapter (0.60 watts versus 0.03 watts), so the intensity of the signal
    is more than 700 times stronger.

- en: Finally, the effect of radio frequency radiation on organic matter is cumulative—the
    longer the body is exposed to radiation, the greater the effect. Most cell phones
    transmit a continuous stream of packets as long as the phone conversation is going
    on, but wireless LANs are bursty services that are only active when they are actually
    transmitting data. The total amount of transmission time for a wireless adapter
    is just a fraction of the time that a cell phone is active.

    network adapter is just a tiny fraction of the amount you receive from a cell
    phone. There are plenty of other, more serious, threats to your health and safety.
