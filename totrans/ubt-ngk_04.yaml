    and writing email messages than doing just about anything else. Even if you're
    not much of a surfer, there are still numerous other applications that aren't
    really Internet applications per se but that still use the Internet in some way,
    such as gathering song and album information when you rip audio CDs to create
    MP3 files. Having a computer that isn't hooked up to the Internet is like buying
    a new Maserati and then refusing to take it out of the garage.

    There are a number of possibilities in this area, including high-speed local area
    networks (LANs), cable modems, mobile (3G) broadband, and ADSL connections from
    phone companies. Some computers still have an internal 56Kbps modem or can be
    connected to external dial-up modems for slower connections over regular phone
    lines. Depending on what you have, setting things up on your system should prove
    a cinch in the case of LAN connections and any others that use your Ethernet port
    (such as cable modems), possibly a bit more work in the case of wireless and mobile
    connections, and sometimes a bit of a challenge when it comes to dial-up connections.
    In this chapter you will learn how to set up these connections, and in the next
    chapter you will learn a bit about what Linux has to offer in terms of the most
    commonly used Internet applications.

    network card (sometimes referred to as an *802.11a/b/g/n card* or *WiFi card*).
    These are built in to almost all modern laptops, while for older models they are
    usually add-ons in the form of cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot on the side
    of your computer (as shown on the right of [Figure 4-3](ch04s04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wifi_setupman_access

    of desktop models, one of its PCI slots. Although support for cards of this type
    has improved through the past couple of years, there are still gaps, and some
    can be rather tricky to deal with. You'll find some tips on how to deal with awkward
    cards in [Chapter 21](ch21.html "Chapter 21. WOUNDED WINGS"), but if you're looking
    for a sure thing, Centrino IPW-2100 and IPW-2200 cards are definitely supported
    by Ubuntu. As for cards of the built-in or PC card variety, you will find support
    much better, but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the card
    you are using is Linux compatible. No matter what wireless card you are wondering
    about, the easiest way to find out whether it will work is to just try it. The
    Linux kernel now comes with many wireless drivers built in, and Ubuntu updates
    often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those
    drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things don't seem to work, check Ubuntu's
    list of supported cards ([https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/)),
    or check the Ubuntu forums to find a driver that is compatible or to see whether
    anyone has experience with your particular card.

    "Figure 4-3. All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface

- en: Though it may not sound that way, what I've just described is pretty much a
    best-case scenario. What happens, however, if your modem and Ubuntu do not see
    eye to eye? Well, there are a few options. My first, more radical suggestion,
    is to dump your dial-up ISP and find a broadband provider that covers your local
    area. If that is not an option, then you have two ways to go. One is to try to
    geek around with your modem to see whether you can get it to work. This is a slightly
    more complicated process, but there are instructions at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto).
    If you are faint of heart or a novice user, you may find what the process entails
    to be a bit more than you're willing to deal with.

    a true hardware modem. *Hardware modems* are not software dependent, so they work
    with any operating system. You can think of them as telephones without a handset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Such modems come in two forms: internal and external. As for the internals,
    the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal slot) and 56 PC
    Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true hardware modems that are easily
    available and are said to work. You can check out the USRobotics site ([http://www.usr.com/](http://www.usr.com/))
    for more information on these models, though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions
    is always a good idea. Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an external
    dial-up modem. They come with either serial or USB connectors and sit in a box
    outside your computer. Because the modem doesn''t use your operating system to
    operate, it does not tie up system resources while it''s busy, which may result
    in a possible pickup in computer speed.'

- en: Linux support for USB modems can be patchy, so do your research before buying
    one. External serial modems are a safer bet since most of them should work with
    your system . . . if you have a serial port, that is. Modern computers rarely
    have them any more, so check to see whether you have one by looking at the back
    of your computer for a connector with little prongs in it (see [Figure 4-5](ch04s06.html#serial_port_and_connector
    "Figure 4-5. Serial port and connector")). If you are worried and are looking
    for a sure thing, Zoom Telephonics ([http://www.zoom.com/](http://www.zoom.com/))
    makes an external serial modem that is compatible with Linux, and the company
    says so right on its website. The USRobotics 56K V.92 External Faxmodem is also
    said to work, though I haven't tried this model myself.

    to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search with that modem's
    make and model number, along with the word *linux*, and see what search results
    you get. Of course, you can also try one of the Linux forums and ask about the
    modem make and model there. A lot of people are in the same boat, so you are sure
    to get plenty of opinions and advice.
