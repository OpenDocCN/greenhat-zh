- en: This is a book for people who want to use the Internet everywhere—not just in
    the office or in the room at home where there's a telephone or cable connection,
    but in the backyard, at the public library, at a highway rest area, or in a hotel
    lobby. In this book you will learn how to choose the best wireless data service
    for your particular needs, how to set up your computer for wireless, and how to
    design and install your own wireless network. We'll also describe some wireless
    products and services that you might not have known about, such as the ability
    to make low-cost, worldwide Voice over Internet (VoIP) telephone calls from your
    laptop computer.

- en: The combination of wireless Internet services and portable computers can make
    a huge difference in the way we use the Internet. By eliminating the tether to
    a wired network, we can gather information, watch and listen to streaming video
    or audio, and exchange messages wherever we might be, rather than only at specific
    locations. It's no longer necessary to return home or to the office or search
    for an Internet café or a public library. Like mobile telephones (which use related
    technology), go-anywhere, always-accessible Internet services can change the way
    we live, work, and entertain ourselves. When wireless broadband Internet services
    work properly, they're practically invisible; just turn on the computer or a smaller
    portable device such as a smartphone, and a universe of information is immediately
    at your fingertips. But we're talking about computers, so complications are always
    possible. In order to help you identify the causes and solutions for wireless
    connection problems, the first few chapters of this book offer details about how
    wireless data communication systems work, including the surprising tale of the
    avant-garde composer and the glamorous actress whose wartime invention provided
    the foundation of modern spread-spectrum technology.

- en: As you read this book, I hope you will remember that a wireless network, and
    for that matter, any kind of communications technology, is a means to an end that
    you use to achieve some other objective. Remember that your original goal was
    to find out if your favorite team won, invite your friends to a dinner party,
    read your class notes, or watch the latest YouTube videos. If you have to concentrate
    on making your wireless connection, you're doing something wrong.

    want to do them, rather than forcing you to adjust your life or work to meet the
    machine's requirements. If you have trouble making your wireless connection (or
    any other computer activity) work "properly," it's almost always the computer's
    fault, or the fault of the people who designed the hardware and software. The
    computer and the network are your servants, and not the other way around.

    information in this book represents a snapshot of a moving target. Within another
    year or two, manufacturers will have replaced some of the products described here
    with new and better models, and the wireless service providers will offer faster
    connections over wider areas. The specific makes and models will change, but the
    general principles ought to remain.

- en: The first edition of this book, *The Book of Wi-Fi*, was limited to 802.11b
    Wi-Fi networks, which were the only practical choice when that book was published
    in 2003\. When I wrote that book, I expected Wi-Fi networks to replace or supplement
    wired home and office networks, but I did not anticipate that a huge number of
    additional Wi-Fi hot spots would also cover public locations. In my Seattle neighborhood,
    I can connect my laptop computer to the Internet at a branch library, half a dozen
    coffee shops, three taverns, four pizza joints, and a supermarket. Today, Wi-Fi
    signals are everywhere, and other broadband services offer wireless signals that
    cover much wider areas than any Wi-Fi network. A few years from now, more and
    better wireless services will offer even faster connections. The dream of a high-speed
    wireless service that works almost everywhere is rapidly coming true.

- en: The first three chapters of this book explain how data networks operate, how
    wireless technology can extend data networks beyond the reach of wired connections,
    and how Wi-Fi networks work. Next, [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. THE HARDWARE
    YOU NEED FOR WI-FI") describes the hardware needed for Wi-Fi and how to design
    and install your own Wi-Fi network. Chapters [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. MANAGING
    YOUR WI-FI CONNECTIONS") and [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. WI-FI FOR WINDOWS")

    DATA"), we''ll move away from Wi-Fi and describe some alternative broadband wireless
    services, including EV-DO, EDGE, and WiMAX. [Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. SMARTPHONES
    AND PDAs") explains how to use Wi-Fi and broadband services with smartphones and
    other pocket-size computers, [Chapter 15](ch15.html "Chapter 15. VIRTUAL PRIVATE
    NETWORKS") describes virtual private networks (VPNs), and [Chapter 16](ch16.html
    "Chapter 16. USING BROADBAND FOR TELEPHONE CALLS") explains how to use wireless
    links to place telephone calls through the Internet. Finally, [Chapter 17](ch17.html
    "Chapter 17. TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING") offers troubleshooting tips and general
    advice.'

    something you can use in every chapter. In particular, please don't ignore the
    chapters on security and VPNs—they contain essential information that can keep
    your network and your data safe. If all your computers use Windows, you can skip
    the Linux/Unix and Macintosh chapters.

- en: If I have done my job as author, this book will improve your experience with
    Wi-Fi and other wireless data services. I hope it will help you understand how
    data moves through the air between your computer and the Internet and how to set
    up and use your own system for best performance. After your wireless connection
    is ready to use, you shouldn't have to think about the network at all. Along the
    way, I hope you enjoy both the book and your time online.
