  <h1><span class="chapter">Chapter 12 -</span><br/>
  Caveat Hacker</h1>

  <p>Reverse engineering and intellectual property law has some tricky legal <span style="font-size: 1em;">interactions. On one hand, innovation deserves its just reward. The right of inventors or authors to exclusively produce or sell the fruits of their labor must be protected. On the other hand, a free and competitive marketplace is also required to preserve innovation and to ensure fair markets. The study of the design principles embodied in existing products and the ability to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">produce improved derivative products are an important part of a competi</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tive market place.</span></p>

  <p>This chapter provides an overview of intellectual property law, and some of the more important bits that you need to know about as a hacker. Ignorance <span style="font-size: 1em;">is not a valid defense, and there are some severe penalties prescribed by the law for those who ignore the laws that govern reverse engineering and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">intellectual property rights. Some acts of intellectual property violation are punishable as felonies along with hefty fines.</span></p>

  <p>The majority of this chapter was written by Lee Tien, a Senior Staff <span style="font-size: 1em;">Attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Lee (and Joseph Liu)</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">were my counsel during the period when I was trying to publish my</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">findings on the Xbox security system. Chapter 8 has a sidebar titled “The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Legal Challenges of Hacking” that describes my fight with MIT to get my</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">paper published.</span></p>

  <p>The content of this chapter is presented with the intention of providing an informational resource for hackers. If you think you may be in a legally <span style="font-size: 1em;">compromising situation, there is no substitute for contacting an attorney</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and getting proper legal advice on your specific situation.</span></p>

    <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) provided me legal <span style="font-size: 1em;">counsel during the period when I was trying to publish my</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">paper on the Xbox security system. The following para</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">graphs introduce what the EFF does, and who they are.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Imagine a world where technology can empower us all to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">share knowledge, ideas, thoughts, humor, music, words and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">art with friends, strangers and future generations.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">That world is here and now, made possible with the elec</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tronic network — the Internet — with the power to connect</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">us all . And future developments in technology wil enable</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">us to access information and communicate with others in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">even more powerful ways.</span></p>

    <p>But governments and corporate interests worldwide are <span style="font-size: 1em;">trying to prevent us from communicating freely through new</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technologies, just as when those in positions of power con</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">trolled the production and distribution of — or even burned</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">— books they did not want people to read in the Middle</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Ages. But only by fighting for our rights to speak freely what-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ever the medium — whether books, telephones, or com</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">puters — can we protect and enhance the human condi</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tion.</span></p>

    <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was created to <span style="font-size: 1em;">defend our rights to think, speak, and share our ideas,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">thoughts, and needs using new technologies, such as the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Internet and the World Wide Web.

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_86"><b class="calibre3">Caveat Hacker: A Primer on Intellectual</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Property, by Lee Tien</b></h2>

  <p>Reverse engineering is the process of extracting know-how or knowledge <span style="font-size: 1em;">from an artifact; in the marketplace, it’s been called the “time-honored</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technique of figuring out just what makes a competitor’s product tick.”<sup>1</sup></span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">But anyone who studies mass-marketed products today should be aware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of the legal minefield surrounding reverse-engineering. The anti</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(DMCA),<sup>2</sup> contractual terms prohibiting reverse-engineering, and the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Economic Espionage Act<sup>3</sup> are a few of the dangerous legal areas that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technologists should know about. This chapter will briefly survey these</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">areas to give hackers a rough idea of the issues.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">There are two general issues here. First, is the reverse engineering lawful?</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Second, even if you may reverse engineer the product, can you publish</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">what you learn from the reverse engineering?</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_87"><b class="calibre3">Classical Intellectual Property Law:</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">An Overview</b></h3>

  <p>Intellectual property law traditionally meant copyrights and patents. Both are created and limited by federal statutes based on the Constitution’s <span style="font-size: 1em;">intellectual property clause: “Congress shall have the Power . . . To</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Writings and Discoveries.”<sup>4</sup> Computer programs are typically protected</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as copyrighted “literary works,” but they can also be patented.</span><sup>5</sup></p>

  <p>People have recently come to think of trade secrets as another kind of <span style="font-size: 1em;">intellectual property. Trade secrets were originally protected by courts under case law, but they are now the subject of both state and federal states as well.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Unlike copyrights and patents, trade secrecy law is historically grounded in unfair competition principles.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In the United States, authors and inventors don’t have “natural rights.”</span><sup>6</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Instead, their rights are based on a notion of public welfare. Society will benefit if authors and inventors get some protection, because they won’t</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">have adequate incentives to create if others can freely use their work. But that protection is limited in order to assure that the public ultimately</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">benefits.</span><sup>7</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">For example, copyright and patent rights are only for “limited</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">times”; eventually, protected works must enter the public domain.</span><sup>8</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">short, intellectual property law sets the terms for a “bargain” between the public and authors or inventors.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_88"><b class="calibre3">Copyright</b></h3>

  <p>Copyright law protects original works of expression that are “fixed” in a <span style="font-size: 1em;">tangible medium and gives the author (or assignee) exclusive rights over</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">reproduction, distribution, adaptation, public display and public perfor</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">mance of the work. It does not protect against independent creation.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Works are not the same as copies or phonorecords (copies of sound</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">recordings). When you buy a book, you own a copy, but the copyright</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">owner retains the rights to the work itself. Note, by the way, that the “first sale” doctrine allows lawful owners of copies to sell or transfer these</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">lawfully owned copies,</span> <sup>9</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with certain exceptions.</span><sup>10</sup></p>

  <p>There are many different types of works, with many different rules for each <span style="font-size: 1em;">type. So copyright law is quite complex, and technology hasn’t simplified</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">matters. Consider a copyrighted song. The song or musical composition</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(MC) is protected by copyright, typically held by the songwriter. To record the song, one needs permission from the MC copyright owner.</span><sup>11</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Once</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">recorded, there is an independent copyright in the sound recording (SR),</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">which protects the actual recorded sounds including the singer’s interpretation of the underlying song as well as the efforts of the producer and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">sound engineers. Record companies usually own SR copyrights. As a result, if you want to use a copyrighted sound recording of the song in a TV</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">commercial, you need permission of both the MC copyright owner and the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">SR copyright owner.</span></p>

  <p>Most of the copyright owner’s rights are fairly obvious, but some of them are not — especially when computers are involved. For instance, computers <span style="font-size: 1em;">load programs into RAM, creating a copy for copyright purposes. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyright act contains a specific exemption that permits the owner of a copy of a computer program to copy the program into computer memory.</span><sup>12</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">This illustrates the general strictness of copyright law: that one can’t use a copyrighted work for its intended purpose without making a copy doesn’t</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">mean that making the copy isn’t copyright infringement. The implications</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of this strictness for the Internet are serious, since Internet dissemination general y involves the making of copies.</span></p>

  <p>The right over adaptation can also be confusing. Adaptations, or “derivative works,” are works based on a copyrighted work: foreign-language translations, movies based on books, and so on. In one much-criticized case, a court found that cutting pictures out of lawfully owned copies and mount<span style="font-size: 1em;">ing the pictures onto ceramic tiles created infringing derivative works.</span><sup>13</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Most courts disagree with this result.</span><sup>14</sup></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Copyright protection begins automatically when a work is created and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">generally lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.<sup>15</sup></span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Works become free for all to use, i.e., enter the public domain, once the copyright term expires.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">There are many exceptions to copyright. The rule that copyright protects</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">expression means that it doesn’t bar anyone from using the ideas or facts</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">revealed in the work. “Ideas” includes the plots of stories. More generally, copyright doesn’t protect the utilitarian aspects of a work, so you can write a computer program that does the same thing as another program so long as you don’t copy its expression.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Facts are considered “outside” copyright because they are discovered, not</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">authored. This would include, for instance, the discovery of new prime</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">numbers. But you can have a copyright in the selection, sequence or</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">arrangement of facts or anything else that is not itself copyrightable. The classic example is an anthology of public-domain poetry. You can have a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyright to the compilation even though the individual pieces are unpro</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tected if the selection, sequence or arrangement is sufficiently original. The alphabetical arrangement of facts in the typical telephone “white pages”</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">directory fails the constitutional originality requirement. You don’t get any protection merely because you invested money, time or effort into collecting the phone numbers.</span></p>

  <p>Copyright doesn’t cover many “ordinary” uses of the work. In itself, <span style="font-size: 1em;">reading a book isn’t subject to copyright, because it doesn’t infringe any of the copyright owner’s rights. Singing a song in the shower is a performance, but the copyright owner only has a right over public performances. Here again, however, the Internet has changed things. When you read a docu</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ment in your web browser, a copy of the document was probably made by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">your computer. Thus, many formerly ordinary uses now entail the making</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of a copy, which raises copyright issues.</span></p>

  <p>Today, there’s a lot of controversy about “fair use.” Fair use is a defense to copyright infringement that was intended to allow people to make some <span style="font-size: 1em;">unauthorized use of copyrighted works. Fair use allows book reviewers to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">quote from books. It’s a very complicated area of law; whether a use is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“fair” depends on factors like the purpose, nature, amount, and economic</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">effect of the use.<sup>16</sup></span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_89"><b class="calibre3">Patent</b></h4>

  <p>Patent law protects inventions and gives the inventor (or his assignee) the right to exclude others from making, selling, or using the invention for 20 <span style="font-size: 1em;">years from the date of the filing of the patent. Unlike copyright, patent law protects against independent invention by another person.</span></p>

  <p>The bargain here is that in return for the patent, the inventor must provide enough information in the patent application to enable one “skilled in the <span style="font-size: 1em;">art” to create the invention without much experimentation. Once a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">patent is awarded, the application is made public. By making the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">information public, the patentee contributes to society’s store of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">knowledge.</span></p>

  <p>A patent confers no affirmative rights, however; if you patent an im<span style="font-size: 1em;">provement to someone else’s invention, you can’t practice the improve</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ment without infringing on the underlying patent. If you invent and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">patent a new drug, you may still need regulatory approval before you can</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">sell the drug.</span></p>

  <p>To be patentable, an invention must be useful, novel, and “nonobvious” <span style="font-size: 1em;">to one “skilled in the art.” The novelty and nonobviousness requirements</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">mean that the invention must be a sufficient development in technology</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">before the right to exclude is given. Developments that do not meet these</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">high standards are denied protection.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_90"><b class="calibre3">Trade Secrets</b></h4>

  <p>A third area of law — trade secrecy — is also considered part of intellectual property law, although it is not really property. A trade secret is commercially valuable business or other information known to the user but not to competitors. Secrecy, although not absolute secrecy, is the essence of a trade secret; one must take reasonable precautions to protect the trade secret against disclosure.</p>

  <p>There’s an obvious relationship between patents and trade secrets, because <span style="font-size: 1em;">both protect useful information. If the useful information isn’t patentable at al , there’s no choice. But one might not want patent a patentable</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">invention for several reasons. You might not want to disclose information</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in the patent application. Also, if you don’t expect the technology to be valuable for very long, it might not be worth getting a patent that lasts 20</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">years.</span></p>

  <p>The main downside of trade secrecy is that it provides no protection against independent invention or against reverse-engineering. Trade secrecy is <span style="font-size: 1em;">therefore unwise if the secret can be figured out from the product. If, on the other hand, the invention is a process used in making the product, it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">might be hard to reverse-engineer. Even though Coca-Cola has been on</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the market for many years, apparently no one has figured out how to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">duplicate it.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_91"><b class="calibre3">The Constitutional Copyright Bargain</b></h4>

  <p>Intellectual property rights are a means to an end — to promote the <span style="font-size: 1em;">progress of knowledge and technology. As the Supreme Court once said,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“the monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are neither unlimited</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">nor primarily designed to provide a special private benefit.”<sup>17</sup></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The above passage indicates that intellectual property law has long been</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">concerned about limiting the potential monopoly power conferred by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyright and patent law. For instance, the first-sale doctrine prevents patent and copyright owners from controlling the market once patented products or copies of copyrighted works are sold.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Also, copyright law has long been interpreted by courts and crafted by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Congress to preserve a balance with freedom of speech. Doctrines like the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">idea/expression dichotomy, the fair use doctrine, and copyright’s limited</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">term are generally viewed as reducing the potential conflict between copyright and freedom of expression.<sup>18</sup></span></p>

  <p>Interestingly, concern about monopolies is historically linked to the concern for free speech. English copyright law had long functioned as a kind of <span style="font-size: 1em;">state-sponsored cartel; in return for private monopolies over writings, the publishers agreed to act as policemen of the press in the service of government censorship — in particular, the Bible and other religious works.</span><sup>19</sup></p>

  <p>Similarly, copyright law’s idea-expression dichotomy ensures that <span style="font-size: 1em;">uncopyrightable facts and ideas and unpatentable functional principles</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">remain in the public domain for future creators to build on.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_92"><b class="calibre3">The Traditional View of Reverse</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Engineering</b></h3>

  <p>Historically, reverse engineering has always been a lawful way to gain <span style="font-size: 1em;">information embodied in mass-marketed products. For many technology</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">firms, reverse-engineering competitors’ products to study their innovations is a standard practice. Indeed, U.S. courts have also treated reverse engineering as an important factor in maintaining balance in intellectual property law, and the Supreme Court has called reverse engineering “an essential part of innovation.”</span></p>

  <p>The law recognizes three main purposes of legitimate reverse engineering. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Competitive reverse-engineering is intended to create a direct substitute.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Compatibility or interoperability reverse-engineering is aimed at figuring out how to make a product that works with the reverse-engineered product.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">And of course, researchers often reverse-engineer products in order to gain knowledge with no commercial purpose.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_93"><b class="calibre3">Trade Secrecy and “Improper Means”</b></h4>

  <p>In general, a trade secret is misappropriated only if a person or firm <span style="font-size: 1em;">misuses or discloses the secret in breach of an agreement or confidential</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">relationship, engages in other wrongful conduct (e.g., bribery, coercion,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">trespass) to obtain the secret, or acquires the secret from a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">misappropriator knowing or having reason to know that the information</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">was a misappropriated trade secret.</span></p>

  <p>Most states, like California, explicitly provide that reverse engineering is a lawful way to acquire a trade secret. Several reasons support reverse engineering as a sound principle of trade secret law.20 Buying a product in the open market generally gives the buyer personal property rights in the product, which include the right to take the product apart, measure it, subject it to testing, and the like. The law also regards sale of a product in the open <span style="font-size: 1em;">market as a publication of innovations it embodies and a dedication of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">them to the public domain unless the creator has obtained patent protection for them.</span></p>

  <p>The vulnerability of trade secrets to reverse engineering is part of the overall constitutional scheme. In <i class="calibre4">Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats</i>, the Supreme Court struck down a Florida law that forbade manufacturers of boats from using existing boat parts as “plugs” for a direct molding process that yielded competing products because the law “prohibit[ed] the entire public from <span style="font-size: 1em;">engaging in a form of reverse engineering of a product in the public</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">domain.”<sup>21</sup> The court explained that reverse engineering is “an essential part of innovation,” likely to yield variations on the product that “could lead to significant advances in technology.” Indeed, “the competitive reality of reverse engineering may act as a spur to the inventor” to develop additional patentable ideas.</span></p>

  <p>In cases like <i class="calibre4">Bonito Boats</i>, the question is whether a state law is “preempted” <span style="font-size: 1em;">by federal law. When federal and state law conflict, either directly or as a matter of federal policy goals, the state law loses under the doctrine of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“conflict” preemption. This stems from the Constitution’s Supremacy</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Clause, under which federal law generally trumps state law.<sup>22</sup> Copyright law also contains a specific preemption clause, discussed below.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_94"><b class="calibre3">Copyright Law and the Problem of</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Intermediate Copying</b></h4>

  <p>Until recently, copyright law didn’t need to worry about reverse engineer<span style="font-size: 1em;">ing, because there was little reason to reverse engineer books, art, or</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">music. Now that computer programs are “literary works,” things are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">much different. Since many computer programs are distributed only in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">object code, the reverse engineering process commonly requires an initial</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">decompilation into source code — which entails making a copy.</span></p>

  <p>U.S. courts have found that copyright law does not necessarily prohibit <span style="font-size: 1em;">reverse-engineering, because copying incidental to reverse engineering can be a “fair use”: “The Copyright Act permits an individual in rightful posses-sion of a copy of a work to undertake necessary efforts to understand the work’s ideas, processes, and methods of operation.”<sup>23</sup> This can be true even when the ultimate goal of the reverse engineering is commercial. The courts generally rely on the Constitutional purpose for copyright protection: “the promotion of ‘the Progress of Science….’” <sup>24</sup> The fair use doctrine advances this Constitutional objective by “encourag[ing] others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.”<sup>25</sup></span></p>

  <p>The key case here was <i class="calibre4">Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc</i>.<sup>26</sup> Accolade disassembled Sega game programs in order to get information necessary to make its games compatible with the Sega Genesis game console. Accolade <span style="font-size: 1em;">then sold its own games in competition with games made by Sega and its</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">licensed developers. Accolade raised a fair use defense to Sega’s claims that the disassembly copies were infringing. The court accepted Accolade’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">defense for the reasons described above. It also noted that if Accolade</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">could not dissassemble Sega’s code, Sega would get “a de facto monopoly</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">over [the unprotected] ideas and functional concepts [in the program],”</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">which is only available under patent law.</span><sup>27</sup></p>

  <p>The court’s holding, however, was limited to reverse engineering undertaken for a “legitimate reason,” such as to gain access to the functional specifications necessary to make a compatible program, and then only if it “provides the only means of access to those elements of the code that are not protected by copyright.”<sup>28</sup></p>

  <p>There is no general fair use defense or reverse-engineering exemption in <span style="font-size: 1em;">patent law. In theory, you shouldn’t need to reverse-engineer a patented</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">product, because the patent specification should inform the relevant</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technical community of the best way to make the invention.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Some reverse engineering activities will not infringe a patent. The buyer of a machine embodying a patented invention, for example, is generally free to disassemble it to study how it works under patent law’s first-sale principle.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Buying the product means that you have the right to use it, and simply</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">studying it doesn’t infringe the patent owner’s exclusive rights to make or sell the invention. Nevertheless, courts sometimes enforce contractual</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">restrictions on reverse engineering.</span><sup>29</sup></p>

  <p>Also, one who tries to make a patented invention to satisfy scientific <span style="font-size: 1em;">curiosity may have an “experimental use” defense. Under U.S. law, this</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">defense is narrow and probably does not include research uses that may lead to development of a patentable invention or a commercial product.<sup>30</sup></span></p>

  <p>The clash between these three areas can be seen if we look again at the <i class="calibre4">Sega</i> situation. Suppose Sega had a patent on an algorithm used in all of its game programs. By disassembling Sega programs, Accolade arguably <span style="font-size: 1em;">“makes” or “uses” the patented algorithm, even if it did so inadvertently.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In short, the intermediate copying problem reappears in the patent context.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_96"><b class="calibre3">New Challenges for Reverse Engineers</b></h3>

  <p>The importance of reverse engineering has only grown with the rise of <span style="font-size: 1em;">commercial cryptography in mass-marketed products, because it is impos</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sible to make systems more secure without trying to break them. Ironically, the growing use of encryption has contributed to laws against reverse</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">engineering. The entertainment industry, for example, now relies on</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">encryption and other technologies to protect digital information like music on CDs and movies on DVDs against unauthorized copying.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Unsurprisingly, new laws have been enacted to prevent people from</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“circumventing” encryption and other forms of security.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Legal encroachments to reverse engineering haven’t been limited to encryp</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tion. In the 1970s and 1980s some states forbade the use of a direct</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">molding process to reverse-engineer boat hulls.</span><sup>31</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the semiconductor industry sought and obtained legislation to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">protect chip layouts from reverse engineering to make clone chips.</span><sup>32</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">A</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">major international agreement on intellectual property rights says nothing</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">about reverse engineering.<sup>33</sup></span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_97"><b class="calibre3">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Problem of Unauthorized Access</b></h4>

  <p>The DMCA is one of the most important laws that now regulate reverse <span style="font-size: 1em;">engineering. One part of the DMCA — its “anti-circumvention” provisions</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">— gives legal protection to technical measures that effectively control access to or prevent copying of a copyrighted work. Unfortunately, the DMCA is extremely complex; for instance, the DMCA makes it unlawful to bypass</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“effective technical protection measures” without clearly specifying what that term means.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_98"><b class="calibre3">Unauthorized Access</b></h4>

  <p>The DMCA essentially creates a new right of “access” for copyright owners. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Spokesmen for the copyright industry liken the act of circumventing a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technical protection system to “breaking and entering” a home.</span></p>

  <p>One simple example is censorware programs used by schools and libraries <span style="font-size: 1em;">to prevent children from viewing inappropriate images. These programs</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">often contain encrypted “blacklists” of censored websites, which vendors</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">typically treat as trade secrets. Suppose a researcher finds that a particular program blocks sites that are wholly appropriate for children, and wants to read the blacklist in order to figure out how many appropriate websites are being wrongly blocked.</span><sup>34</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Because the vendor has encrypted the blacklist in order to prevent people from gaining access to its content, and the list is arguably a copyrighted compilation of facts, the encryption is a technical protection measure applied to a copyrighted work and unauthorized</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">decryption would be an unlawful act of circumvention — except that the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">DMCA currently has a temporary exemption for decrypting censorware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">blacklists.</span></p>

  <p>Another example: the movie industry uses an encryption scheme called <span style="font-size: 1em;">Content Scrambling System (CSS) to protect movies on DVDs. In the</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">2600</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">case,</span><sup>35</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">CSS was held to be a technical measure that “effectively” controls</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">access to movies. Bypassing CSS without the copyright owner’s authoriza</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tion is an unlawful “act of circumvention” under the DMCA. Note that the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">courts have not found that the fair use doctrine applies to the DMCA (as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">opposed to copyright law). Thus, if the use of CSS prevents you from</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">fast-forwarding through the commercials on a DVD movie — it is still</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">unlawful to “circumvent” that restriction.</span></p>

  <p>Note here that the notion of “effective” here is not connected to <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptographic efficacy. Even weak encryption is “effective” under the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">DMCA because the ordinary person could not defeat it.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_99"><b class="calibre3">Circumvention Technologies</b></h4>

  <p>The DMCA protects technical measures in a second way: its “anti-device” <span style="font-size: 1em;">provisions outlaw the manufacture and distribution of technologies that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">enable circumvention.<sup>36</sup> Continuing the “breaking and entering” metaphor,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">spokesmen for the copyright industry liken circumvention technologies to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“burglars’ tools,” which are illegal in many states.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Section 1201 of the DMCA states that “[n]o person shall manufacture,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof ” if it has one or more of the following three characteristics: (1) if it is “primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing [technical] protection,” (2) if it has “only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent [technical] protection,” or (3) if it is “marketed by that person or another acting on its behalf with that person’s knowledge for use in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">circumventing technical protection.”</span></p>

  <p>Note that these provisions apply not only to the new right of “access <span style="font-size: 1em;">control,” but to the rights of copyright owners generally. Thus, technologies that would circumvent copy-protection measures for CDs can be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">unlawful under these provisions.</span></p>

  <p>Recall the two examples just given. In the <i class="calibre4">2600</i> case, at issue was the DeCSS <span style="font-size: 1em;">program, which enables people to decrypt DVD movies protected by CSS.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">DeCSS was found to be a prohibited circumvention technology. In the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">censorware example, the DMCA exemption permits the act of decryption,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">but it says nothing about whether a censorware researcher can make available the computer program used to decrypt the encrypted blacklist, or even</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the details of the method of decryption.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_100"><b class="calibre3">Navigating the DMCA’s Exemptions</b></h4>

  <p>Just as you can’t reverse-engineer object code without decompiling or <span style="font-size: 1em;">dissassembling it, you can’t reverse- engineer a technical protection measure without circumventing it. Moreover, you often need a technological device</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">or tool to actually perform reverse engineering, so the ban on circumvention technologies also restricts reverse engineering.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">In combination, these DMCA provisions create major barriers to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptographers and security researchers who want to analyze the security</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">measures used in real, mass-marketed products. A commercial reverse</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">engineer who discovers a problem with another firm’s technical measure</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and offers suggestions about how to improve it is at risk of being</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">indicted on criminal DMCA charges.</span></p>

  <p>Even an academic reverse engineer is at risk of being sued for publishing <span style="font-size: 1em;">a paper about the weaknesses in a firm’s security measures, because such a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">paper could be labeled a “tool of circumvention.”<sup>37</sup> One example is </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">Princeton professor Edward Felten, who assembled and entered a team of </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">scientists in the music industry’s “SDMI Challenge,” a contest to crack digital watermarking and other technologies being considered by the Secure Digital Music Initiative for protecting digital music. Felten and his team entered the contest with the intent of using the SDMI Challenge as a real-world security case study, and they eventually authored a peer-reviewed academic paper that was to be presented at a conference. Before the paper was actually presented, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sent Felten and the conference organizers a letter warning him that publishing the paper would</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">violate intellectual property laws, including the DMCA.</span></p>

  <p>The DMCA also contains several exemptions relevant to reverse engineering: <span style="font-size: 1em;">circumvention of a technical protection system when necessary to achieve</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">interoperability among computer programs; circumventions conducted in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the course of legitimate encryption research; and circumvention for purposes of computer security testing. Unfortunately, each of these exemptions is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">both complex and narrow. Even when the act of reverse-engineering is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">allowed, the DMCA strictly regulates what can be done with the resulting</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">information.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_101"><b class="calibre3">1201(f): reverse-engineering for interoperability</b></h4>

  <p>This exemption allows the circumvention of technical protection measures <span style="font-size: 1em;">for interoperability reverse engineering. It also allows, to a very limited extent, the dissemination of information gained from reverse-engineering.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Note that 1201(f) would not have exempted Felten’s attack on the SDMI</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">watermarks, because it had no relation to interoperability.</span></p>

  <p>The <i class="calibre4">2600</i> case, mentioned earlier, concerns the publication of a computer program known as “DeCSS” on the website of 2600 Magazine. <span style="font-size: 1em;">DeCSS can be used to bypass CSS, the technical protection measure used</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to control access to DVD movies. EFF, which represented 2600</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Magazine, argued that DeCSS qualifies for the interoperability privilege</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of 1201(f). DeCSS was designed, we argued, to enable people to build</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">software that would enable them to play legitimately purchased DVD</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">movies on their platform of choice, namely, Linux computer systems.</span></p>

  <p>The courts rejected this argument, saying that 1201(f) only permitted <span style="font-size: 1em;">circumvention for purposes of achieving program-to-program</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">interoperability, whereas DeCSS enabled program-to-data</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">interoperability that 1201(f) did not cover. This ruling is dubious,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">because there are computer programs as well as data on movie DVDs.</span></p>

  <p>While 1201(f) seems to follow <i class="calibre4">Sega</i> in permitting interoperability reverse-engineering, it is more restrictive in several ways: interoperability is the only legitimate purpose for which reverse engineering may be done; only program-to-program interoperability qualifies, even though circumvention <span style="font-size: 1em;">may be needed to achieve hardware-to-program interoperability or program-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">to-data interoperability; and the information resulting from reverse engi</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">neering cannot be freely published.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_102"><b class="calibre3">1201(g): encryption research</b></h4>

  <p>The DMCA also contains an express exemption for encryption research. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Unfortunately, it is also very narrow. For one thing, this exception only</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">applies if the cryptographer has asked (even if he or she has not received) permission from the copyright owner to engage in an act of circumvention</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">before the circumvention is accomplished. Second, the statute emphasizes</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the need for a cryptographer to be an expert in order to qualify for this</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">exemption, even though some of the most brilliant minds in the field of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptology lack formal training. Third, the statute permits a cryptanalyst to make tools to bypass access controls, but is silent on whether tools to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">bypass use or copy controls are permissible (that is, it contains an exception to one but not both of the anti-device rules). Fourth, it regulates the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cryptologist’s ability to disseminate the results of decryption.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Consider again Prof. Felten’s SDMI research: it would not be exempted by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">1201(g) because digital watermarks are not encryption.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_103"><b class="calibre3">1201(j): security research</b></h4>

  <p>The DMCA’s security research exemption has a similar structure: it applies only if the tester asks in advance and likewise allows making tools only to bypass access controls, not copy or use controls. Like 1201(g), it too regulates the tester’s dissemination of the results of the testing.</p>

  <p>Even in this narrow form, it is not clear whether Felten’s research would be covered. Sec. 1201(j) only permits making a tool to bypass an access control. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Is a digital watermark an access control or a copy control? The answer to this question depends to a large extent on how the watermark is used. EFF</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">argued that, as contemplated by the RIAA, the SDMI watermark</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">technologies were both access and copy control technologies.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_104"><b class="calibre3">End-User License Agreements and</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Contractual Prohibitions on</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Reverse-Engineering</b></h4>

  <p>Intellectual property isn’t the only obstacle to reverse engineering. It’s common for software licenses to prohibit reverse engineering. A typical <span style="font-size: 1em;">license clause might say: “You may not, and you may not permit others to,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(a) disassemble, decompile or otherwise derive source code from the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Software, (b) reverse engineer the Software, (c) modify or prepare</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">derivative works of the Software, (d) copy the Software, except as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">expressly permitted in this Agreement, (e) rent or lease the Software, or</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(f) use the Software in any manner that infringes the intellectual property or other rights of Licensor or another party.”</span></p>

  <p>Companies argue that such provisions legally bind purchasers not to reverse engineer their software. If they do so anyway, they have breached a contract and can be sued for damages. The problem, of course, is that the anti-reverse-engineering provision gives the copyright owner rights beyond those it would have under, say, the <i class="calibre4">Sega</i> decision.</p>

  <p>Whether this kind of contractual prohibition is enforceable is a hotly <span style="font-size: 1em;">disputed issue. Courts have sometimes rejected reverse engineering</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">defenses in trade secrecy cases because this activity exceeded the scope of licensed uses of the software.<sup>38</sup> Courts have sometimes refused to enforce</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">software shrinkwrap license restrictions against reverse engineering because of a conflict between the clause and federal intel ectual property policy. In</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">,<sup>39</sup> the maker of copy-protection software tried to enforce an anti-reverse-engineering clause under Louisiana law against a firm that had reverse-engineered its copy-protection scheme. The court held that federal law preempted the contractual clause as a matter</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of federal policy, the same argument used in</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">Bonito Boats</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to override the Florida boat hull law.</span></p>

  <p>In addition, Section 301 of the Copyright Act preempts state-created or <span style="font-size: 1em;">state-enforced rights “that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">within the general scope of copyright . . . .” As might be expected,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">there’s a debate about what “equivalent” means. Courts have said that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contract provisions enforceable under state law are “equivalent” to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">federal copyright when the conditions for infringement are the same. But</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">if infringement of the state-created right requires an “extra element,” it is not “equivalent.”</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Such a contractual clause was recently found enforceable. In</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">Bowers v.</i> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">Baystate Technologies, Inc.</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">,<sup>40</sup> an inventor marketed a patented computer-aided design (CAD) software “toolkit” with an anti-reverse-engineering</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">license clause. Baystate, a competitor, reverse engineered Bowers’</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">software and then marketed a competing CAD toolkit. After some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">complicated litigation, the court eventually held, among other things, that Baystate breached its contract with Bowers.</span></p>

  <p>The court held that the license wasn’t preempted because a contract has <span style="font-size: 1em;">an “extra element” — the parties must agree.<sup>41</sup> It follows that federal</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyright law can never preempt a contractual prohibition. The problem</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with the</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">Bowers</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">decision is that it focuses only on the specific preemption clause of the Copyright Act and completely ignores constitutional</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“conflict” preemption.<sup>42</sup></span></p>

  <p>The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) is a state <span style="font-size: 1em;">legislative atttempt to address these issues, but it is also mired in controversy.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_105"><b class="calibre3">Trade secrets and the Economic</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Espionage Act</b></h4>

  <p>The Economic Espionage Act (EEA)<sup>43</sup> created the first federal cause of <span style="font-size: 1em;">action for trade secrecy misappropriation. But it has no reverse engineering defense. This is troubling because rights granted under the EEA arguably</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">implicate certain reverse engineering activities previously thought to be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">lawful. In particular, it’s unclear whether decompilation and disassembly of computer programs may violate EEA rules that forbid duplicating trade</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">secrets.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_106"><b class="calibre3">The Responsible Hacker:</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Ignorance Is No Defense</b></h3>

  <p>In general, there are two ways you can violate intellectual property laws. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Direct infringement means that you actually infringed. Indirect infringement means that you facilitated actual infringement by someone else. For</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">example, in the Betamax case, the issue was whether Sony, by selling</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">VCRs, could be found liable for its customers’ copyright infringement.</span></p>

  <h4 id="sigil_toc_id_107"><b class="calibre3">Civil and Criminal Offenses and Penalties</b></h4>

  <p>The legal theories we’ve talked about carry a broad range of potential <span style="font-size: 1em;">penalties. The main concern is civil liability, either economic damages or an injunction against the activity or both. Damages are usually tied to the amount of harm caused by the infringement.</span></p>

  <p>In patent law, for example, the usual basis for damages is that of a “reasonable royalty.” The court will calculate how much you should have paid the <span style="font-size: 1em;">patent owner in royalties if you had contracted for a license. Damages can also be based on the infringer’s profits or the patent owner’s lost profits.</span></p>

  <p>“Willful” infringement is treated more harshly. The patent statute permits a court, in its discretion, to increase damages up to three times the base <span style="font-size: 1em;">damages (and also to pay the patent owner’s attorney’s fees) if the infringer knew about the patent and did not consult with competent patent counsel.</span></p>

  <p>The current trend in intellectual property law is toward greater attention to criminal penalties. Under the first federal copyright act in 1790, copyright infringement was a purely civil matter. It was not until 1897 that Congress added criminal penalties to the copyright act, and criminal copyright infrngement was classified as a misdemeanor.<sup>44</sup> Moreover, criminal <span style="font-size: 1em;">copyright infringement was rarely used.</span></p>

  <p>Today, the risk of criminal prosecution appears considerably higher, and the criminal penalties are much greater. Amendments to the copyright act in <span style="font-size: 1em;">1982 and 1992, for instance, classified certain kinds of infringement as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">felonies. Even then, however, criminal infringement had to be undertaken</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">willfully and for commercial advantage or private financial gain.</span></p>

  <p>The 1997 No Electronic Theft Act (NET Act) criminalized the reproduction <span style="font-size: 1em;">or distribution of one or more copies of copyrighted works that have an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">aggregate retail value of over $1,000 during any 180 day period, regardless of how those copies are created or distributed. It retained the willfulness requirement, but eliminated the requirement that the defendant’s infringe</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ment be motivated by profit or commercial gain.</span></p>

  <p>The DMCA also contains criminal provisions, which were invoked in the <span style="font-size: 1em;">prosecution of Dmitry Sklyarov and the company he worked for,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ElcomSoft. Elcomsoft produced and distributed software that can be used</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to convert digital books from Adobe’s eBook format into Adobe’s PDF</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">format. In the course of the format conversion, the use restrictions</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">imposed by the eBook format are stripped away. It was undisputed that the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Elcomsoft software can be used to facilitate noninfringing uses of eBooks</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(e.g., fair use excerpting, or to facilitate automated translation into Braille for blind readers). Sklyarov himself was never accused of infringing a copyright, or assisting in the infringing activities of any third party. Nevertheless, for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">his part in developing the software, the FBI arrested him and held him in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">custody for 3 weeks.<sup>45</sup> He and Elcomsoft were indicted by a grand jury;</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">based on the indictment, Sklyarov faced a maximum of 25 years in prison</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and a fine that could exceed $2 million.</span><sup>46</sup> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ElcomSoft and Sklyarov eventually were found not guilty of violating the DMCA.</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_108"><b class="calibre3">Reverse Engineering as “The Freedom to</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Tinker” and Other Legal Issues</b></h3>

  <p>Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton University, views <span style="font-size: 1em;">reverse engineering as a part of the “the freedom to tinker,” which should</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">include the freedom to “take them apart, to discuss them, to explore how</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">they work, to modify them, to make them better.” Felten argues that “as</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">more and more of our world is experienced through electronic devices, and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">communications and culture are more and more mediated by these devices,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">it becomes increasingly important that we be able to tinker with them, to be able to understand this part of our world.”</span></p>

  <p>The freedom to tinker should also include the right to talk about tinkering. <span style="font-size: 1em;">But as we’ve seen, many of the new intellectual property rules limit the right of reverse-engineers to share what they learn from tinkering. These limits not only raise serious First Amendment free-speech issues, they go to the heart of the constitutional basis for copyright and patent law: progress in the arts and sciences. One of the major issues raised by the DMCA is its</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chilling effect on scientists.</span><sup>47</sup></p>
