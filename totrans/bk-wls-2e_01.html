Today, Wi-Fi and other broadband services allow millions of users to connect to the Internet when they're away from their homes or offices, as wireless signals cover entire metropolitan areas.</p><p>A variety of products and services use different methods to accomplish essentially the same objective: wirelessly exchanging network data using radio signals. Each service has a somewhat different set of features, and each uses a slightly different technology. The three most widely used systems are Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 3G cellular service.</p><p>The next chapter explains how these three broadband wireless networks work. But before we go into detail about specific wireless data network services, it will be helpful to understand networks in more general terms.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="moving_data_around"/>Moving Data Around</h1></div></div></div><p>To begin, let's review the general structure of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0002"/>computer data and the methods that networks use to move data from one place to another. This is very basic stuff that might already be familiar to you, but bear with me for a few pages. This really will help you to understand how a wireless network operates.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bits_and_bytes"/>Bits and Bytes</h2></div></div></div><p>As you probably know, the processing unit of a computer can recognize only two information states: either a signal is present or not present at the input to the processor. These two conditions are usually described as 1 and 0, on and off, or mark and space. Each instance of a 1 or a 0 is a <span class="emphasis"><em>bit</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0004"/></p><p>The form that each 1 or 0 takes varies in different types of communication <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0005"/>channels. It can be a light, a sound, or an electrical charge that is either on or off, a series of long and short sounds or light flashes, two different audio tones, or two different radio frequencies.</p><p>Individual bits are not particularly useful, but when you string 8 of them together into a <span class="emphasis"><em>byte</em></span>, you can have 256 different combinations. That's enough to assign different sequences to all the letters in the alphabet (both upper- and lowercase), the 10 digits from 0 to 9, spaces between words, and other symbols such as punctuation marks and letters used in foreign alphabets. A modern computer recognizes and processes several 8-bit bytes at the same time. When processing is complete, the computer transmits the same stream of bits at its output. The output might be connected to a printer, a video display, or a data communication channel. Or it might be something else entirely, such as a series of flashing lights. <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#these_bits_form_the_sequence_of_a_010000" title="Figure 1-1. These bits form the sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110).">Figure 1-1</a> is an example of a sequence of bits.</p><div class="figure"><a id="these_bits_form_the_sequence_of_a_010000"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e246"/><img alt="These bits form the sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110)." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254039.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 1-1. These bits form the sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110).</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The inputs and outputs that we're concerned about here are the ones that form a communication circuit. Like the computer processor, a data channel can recognize only one bit at a time. Either there's a signal on the line or there isn't.</p><p>However, over short distances, it's possible to send the data through a cable that carries eight (or some multiple of eight) signals in <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel</em></span> through eight separate wires. Obviously, a parallel connection can be eight times faster than sending one bit through a single wire, but those eight wires cost eight times as much as a single wire. That added cost is insignificant when the wires are only a foot or two long, but when you're trying to send the data over a long distance, that additional cost can be prohibitive. And when you're using existing circuits, such as telephone lines, you don't have any choice; you must find a way to send all eight bits through the existing pair of wires (or other media). The solution is to transmit one bit at a time with some additional bits and pauses that identify the beginning of each new byte. This is a <span class="emphasis"><em>serial</em></span> data communication channel, which means that you're sending bits one after another. At this stage, it doesn't matter what medium you use to transmit those bits—it could be electrical impulses on a wire, two different audio tones, a series of flashing lights, or even a lot of notes attached to the legs of carrier pigeons—but you must have a method for converting the output of the computer to the signals used by the transmission medium and converting it back again at the other end.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0007"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="error_checking"/>Error Checking</h2></div></div></div><p>In a perfect transmission circuit, the signal that goes in at one end will be absolutely identical to the one that comes out at the other end. But in the real world, there's almost always some kind of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0008"/>noise that can interfere with our original pure signal. <span class="emphasis"><em>Noise</em></span> is defined as anything that is added to the original signal; it could be caused by a lightning strike, interference from another communication channel, or dirt on an electrical contact someplace in the circuit (or in the case of those carrier pigeons, an attack by a marauding hawk). Whatever the source, noise in the channel can interrupt the flow of data. In a modern communication system, those bits are pouring through the circuit extremely quickly—millions of them every second—so a noise hit for even a fraction of a second can obliterate enough bits to turn your data into digital gibberish.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0009"/></p><p>Therefore, you must include a process called <span class="emphasis"><em>error checking</em></span> in your data stream. Error checking is accomplished by adding some kind of standard information to each byte. In a simple computer data network, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0010"/>handshaking information (described in the next section) is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>parity bit</em></span>, which tells the device receiving each byte whether the sum of the ones and zeroes inside the byte is odd or even. If the receiving device discovers that the parity bit is not what it expected, it instructs the transmitter to send the same byte again. This value is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>checksum</em></span>. More complex networks, including wireless systems, include additional error checking <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0011"/>handshaking data with each string of data.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0014"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="handshaking"/>Handshaking</h2></div></div></div><p>Of course, the computer that originates a message or a stream of data can't just jump online and start sending bytes. First it has to warn the device at the other end that it is ready to send data and make sure that the intended recipient is ready to accept data. To accomplish this, a series of <span class="emphasis"><em>handshaking</em></span> requests and answers must surround the actual data.</p><p>The sequence of requests goes something like this:</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td>Origin: "Hey destination! I have some data for you."</td></tr><tr><td>Destination: "Okay, origin, go ahead. I'm ready."</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: "Here comes the data."</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: Data data data data … checksum</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: "That's the message. Did you get it?"</td></tr><tr><td>Destination: "I got something, but it appears to be damaged."</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: "Here it is again."</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: Data data data data … checksum</td></tr><tr><td>Origin: "Did you get it that time?"</td></tr><tr><td>Destination: "Yup, I got it. I'm ready for more data."</td></tr></table><p>We can leave the specific contents of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0015"/>handshaking information to the network designers and engineers, but it's important to understand that every bit that moves through a computer data network is not part of the original information that arrived at the input computer. In a complex network, such as a wireless data channel, as much as 40 percent or more of the transmitted data is <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0016"/>handshaking and other overhead. It's all essential, but every one of those bits increases the amount of time that the message needs to move through the network.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_the_destination"/>Finding the Destination</h2></div></div></div><p>Communication over a direct physical connection (e.g., a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0017"/>wired connection) between the origin and destination doesn't need to include any kind of address or routing information as part of the message. You might have to set up the connection first (by placing a telephone call or plugging cables into a switchboard), but after you're connected, the link remains in place until you instruct the system to disconnect. This kind of connection is great for voice and simple data links, but it's not efficient for digital data on a complex network that serves many origins and destinations because a single connection ties up the circuit all the time, even when no data is moving through the channel.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0018"/></p><p>The alternative is to send your message to a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0019"/>switching center that will hold it until a link to the destination becomes available. This is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>store and forward</em></span> system. If the network has been properly designed for the type of data and the amount of traffic in the system, the waiting time will be insignificant. If the communication network covers a lot of territory, you can forward the message to one or more intermediate switching centers before it reaches its ultimate destination. The great advantage of this approach is that many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0020"/>messages can share the same circuits on an as-available basis.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0021"/></p><p>To make the network even more efficient, you can divide messages that are longer than some arbitrary limit into separate pieces called <span class="emphasis"><em>packets</em></span>. Packets from more than one message can travel together on the same circuit, reassemble themselves into the original messages at the destination, and combine with packets that contain other messages as they travel between <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0022"/>switching centers. Each data packet must also contain another set of information: the address of the packet's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0023"/>destination, the sequence of the packet relative to other packets in the original transmission, and so forth. Some of this information instructs the switching centers where to forward each packet, and other information tells the destination device how to reassemble the data in the packet back into the original message.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0024"/></p><p>That same pattern is repeated every time you add another layer of activity to a communication system. Each layer can attach additional information to the original message and strip off that information after it has done whatever the added information instructed it to do. By the time a message travels from a laptop computer on a wireless network through a local area network (LAN) and an Internet gateway to a distant computer that is connected to another LAN, a dozen or more information attachments might be added and removed before the recipient reads the original text. A package of data that includes address and control information ahead of the bits that contain the content of the message, followed by an error-checking sequence, is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>frame</em></span>. Both wired and wireless networks divide the data stream into frames that contain various forms of handshaking information along with the original data.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0025"/></p><p>It might be helpful to think of these bits, bytes, packets, and frames as the digital version of a letter that you send through a complicated mail delivery system:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You write a letter and put it into an envelope. The name and address of the recipient is on the outside of the envelope.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You take the letter to the mail room, where a clerk puts your envelope into a bigger Express Mail envelope. The big envelope has the name and address of the office where the recipient works.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The mail room clerk takes the big envelope to the post office where another clerk puts it into a mail sack. The post office attaches a tag to the sack, marked with the location of the post office that serves the recipient's office.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The mail sack travels on a truck to the airport, where it is loaded into a shipping container along with other sacks going to the same destination city. The shipping container has a label that tells the freight handlers there's mail inside.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The freight handlers place the container inside an airplane.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At this point, your letter is inside your envelope, which is inside the Express Mail envelope, which is inside a mail sack, inside a container, inside an airplane. The airplane flies to another airport near the destination city.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the destination airport, the ground crew unloads the container from the airplane.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The freight handlers remove the sack from the shipping container and put it on another truck.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The truck takes the sack to a post office near the recipient's office.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the post office, another mail clerk takes the big envelope out of the sack and gives it to a letter carrier.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The letter carrier delivers the big Express Mail envelope to the recipient's office.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The receptionist in the office takes your envelope out of the Express Mail envelope and gives it to the recipient.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The recipient opens your envelope and reads the letter.</p></li></ol></div><p>At each step, the information on the outside of the package tells somebody how to handle it, but that person doesn't care what's inside. Neither you nor the person who ultimately reads your letter ever sees the big Express Mail envelope, the mail sack, the truck, the container, or the airplane, but every one of those containers plays an important part in moving your letter from here to there.</p><p>Instead of envelopes, sacks, containers, and airplanes, an electronic message uses strings of data at the beginning or end of each packet to tell the system how and where to handle your message, but the end result is just about the same. In the OSI network model (described in the next section), each mode of transportation is a separate layer.</p><p>Fortunately, the network software adds and removes all of the preambles, addresses, checksums, and other information automatically so you and the person receiving your message never see them.</p><p>However, each item added to the original data increases the size of the packet, frame, or other package, and therefore increases the amount of time necessary to transmit the data through the network. Because the nominal data <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0026"/>transfer speed includes all the overhead information along with the data in your original message, the actual data transfer speed through a wireless network is a lot slower than the nominal speed. In other words, even if your network connects at 11Mbps, your actual file transfer speed might only be about 6 or 7Mbps or even less. That sounds like a huge slowdown, but it really doesn't matter in a Wi-Fi network that's connected to the Internet through a 1.5Mbps DSL line or even a 5Mbps cable modem; your wireless link is still able to handle data transfer more quickly than the DSL or cable modem can provide it. On the other hand, if you're using Wi-Fi with an ultra-fast fiber optic connection to the Internet, or if you want to move very large audio, video, or CAD files around your own local network, you will want to use one of the faster Wi-Fi versions, either <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0027"/>802.11g or (when it becomes available) <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0028"/>802.11n.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e479"/></p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_iso_osi_model"/>The ISO OSI Model</h1></div></div></div><p>As the package delivery example demonstrates, the information itself is only part of the process. When information moves across a network, it's essential that all of the parties involved—the originator, the ultimate recipient, and everything in between—agree that they will use the same formatting, timing, and routing rules and specifications. These rules (also called <span class="emphasis"><em>protocols</em></span>) define the network's internal "plumbing" and the form of the information that moves through it.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0029"/></p><p>As network communication has become more complex, the community of network designers has accepted the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0030"/>International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0031"/>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model to identify the individual elements of a network link. The OSI model applies to just about any kind of data communication system, including the broadband wireless network that will be described in the rest of this book.</p><p>Because everybody in the communication industry uses the OSI model, it encourages hardware and software designers to create systems and services that can exchange information with similar products from other manufacturers. Without the OSI model or something like it, it would not be possible to expect equipment from more than one source to work together.</p><p>The OSI model also allows a designer to change just one element of the network without the need to design everything else from scratch. For example, a wireless network uses radio signals instead of cables at the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0032"/>physical layer and adds routing information at the data link layer, but it keeps the existing protocols and specifications for everything else. A complex network (such as the Internet) can use wired connections for one part of the signal path and wireless connections for another.</p><p>The OSI model is usually portrayed as a stack of seven layers with each layer acting as a foundation for the layer directly above it as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#the_osi_network_model_has_seven_layers" title="Figure 1-2. The OSI network model has seven layers.">Figure 1-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_osi_network_model_has_seven_layers"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e520"/><img alt="The OSI network model has seven layers." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254842.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 1-2. The OSI network model has seven layers.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Starting at the bottom, the seven layers of the OSI model are described in the following sections.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_physical_layer"/>The Physical Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>As the name suggests, the <span class="emphasis"><em>physical layer</em></span> defines the physical media or hardware that carries signals between the end points of a network connection. The physical layer might be a coaxial cable, a pair of telephone wires, flashing lights, or radio waves.</p><p>The specifications of a network's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0033"/>physical layer might include the shape of the shell and the pin numbers in a cable connector, the voltages that define the 0 and 1 (on and off) values, the durations of individual data bits, and the radio frequencies and modulation methods used by a radio transmitter and receiver.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_data_link_layer"/>The Data Link Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>data link layer</em></span> handles transmission of data across the link defined by the physical layer. It specifies the format of each data packet that moves across the network, including the destination of each packet, the physical structure of the network, the sequence of packets (to make sure that the packets arrive in the correct order), and the type of flow control (to make sure that the transmitter doesn't send data faster than the receiver can handle it). Each packet also includes a checksum that the receiver uses to confirm that the data was not corrupted during transmission, as well as the string of bits and bytes that contains the actual data inside the packet. Therefore, it contains the software that creates and interprets the signals that move through the physical layer.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0034"/></p><p>In both wired and wireless Ethernet, every physical device that is connected to the network has a unique 48-bit media access control (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0035"/>MAC) address that identifies it to the network. The header (the first part of the data string inside of a packet) includes the MAC addresses of both the origin and destination of that packet.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_network_layer"/>The Network Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>network layer</em></span> specifies the route that a signal uses to move from the source to the destination independently of the physical media. At the network level, it doesn't matter whether the data moves through a cable, radio waves, or if it uses some combination of both because that's all handled at a lower level.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0036"/></p><p>Within the Internet, the exchange of data between LANs, wide area networks (WANs), and the core Internet trunk circuits occurs at the network layer.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_transport_layer"/>The Transport Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>Starting at the transport layer, the OSI model is concerned with communication between programs on two different computers rather than the process of moving data from point A to point B. For example, when you view a web page on the Internet, the connection between the browser on your computer (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) and the webserver that contains that page occurs at the <span class="emphasis"><em>transport layer</em></span> (but the commands you send to the server occur at the application layer).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-1-0037"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_session_layer"/>The Session Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>session layer</em></span> defines the format that the programs connected through the transport layer use to exchange data.

For example, when you send an email message, the content of your message (but not the address or the formatting information) is in the application layer. Most of the words, pictures, sounds, and other forms of information that you send through a network enter the system through the application layer.</p></div></div>
