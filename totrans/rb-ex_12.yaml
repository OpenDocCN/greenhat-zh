- en: In this chapter, we’ll discuss Ruby’s package-management system, RubyGems, as
    well as Ruby’s most prominent web development framework, Rails. These somewhat
    disparate subjects are lumped together because the “canonical” way to install
    Rails is with the RubyGems software. By the end of this chapter, you will be able
    to install Rails via RubyGems and understand the basic structure and purpose of
    the files that make up a Rails application.

    Windows Update, and the various flavors of GNU/Linux have programs like RPM, YUM,
    and my favorite, APT. Good programming languages have similar programs that give
    programmers and other users access to vast libraries of software written in that
    language. Perl has the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ([http://cpan.org](http://cpan.org)),

    the Ruby community. With this system, you can easily use other programmers’ software
    to make your job easier, and you can also share your own work, likely making some
    other programmer’s job easier. Each bundle of software that is packaged together
    as a single unit via RubyGems is called a *gem*, and users are able to manipulate
    such gems with the appropriately named `gem` command.

    Rails is “an open-source web framework that’s optimized for programmer happiness
    and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention
    over configuration.” The site describes it as “Web development that doesn’t hurt.”
    What does that mean?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since it optimizes for programmer happiness and focuses on the ability to write
    beautiful code, Rails is well within the design philosophy of Ruby itself. Rails
    picks sensible defaults for its behavior, and as long as you are willing to follow
    those conventions, your job as the programmer becomes relatively easy. Rails provides
    shortcuts and tools for you to generate a skeleton of a web application very quickly;
    it allows you to place each piece of code in a reasonable location within the
    directory structure that is appropriate to the job that code is expected to perform.
    This provides clean, well-ordered, reusable code that helps you develop an application
    quickly, efficiently, and painlessly.

    system’s package manager, you should install MySQL. This is probably easiest to
    do through your operating system’s package manager. The pre-packaged Rails installers
    like Instant Rails and Locomotive generally come with their own pre-configured
    databases; however, for all subsequent examples, I’ll assume you installed Rails

- en: The Structure of a Rails Application
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rails operates under a design philosophy (or *pattern*) for software called
    Model-View-Controller (MVC), developed by Norwegian computer scientist Trygve
    Reenskaug^([[35](#ftn.CHP-12-FNOTE-1)]) while he was working at Xerox PARC in
    the late 1970s. It was originally developed in relation to traditional graphical
    user interfaces (GUIs), but MVC has recently become very popular in web development.
    The basics of this pattern are as follows. The *Model* represents the data and
    is an object of some sort. The *View* is a way of presenting data, whether directly
    to a user or to some other computer, or as any other type of output. The *Controller*
    is the traffic cop or manager that keeps track of any requested actions, queries
    or manipulates the Model to get or update data, and gives the View whatever information
    it needs to format the data as necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s consider an example to help explain this pattern. Back in our second currency
    conversion script ([#19 Currency Conversion, Advanced (currency_converter2.rb)](ch05s05.html
    "#19 Currency Conversion, Advanced (currency_converter2.rb)") on page 90), we
    used data retrieved from an RSS feed. In MVC terms, that data is the Model. That
    same data could have been presented (or Viewed) on a traditional HTML web page,
    as a plaintext file for download, or as a YAML file. In all of these different
    examples, the Model would stay the same and would be something like ExchangeRate
    or CurrencyUnit, depending on how the application was designed. The Controller
    would also be the same, and it would be responsible for retrieving the data from
    a server. We’d probably call it the Download Controller, since it would be used
    to download data from a server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For the sake of argument, let’s say that we also wanted to present our Model
    in some completely different way, perhaps written down on paper. The written piece
    of paper would use a different Controller, one that deals with paper instead of
    servers. Perhaps we’d call it the Pencil Controller. The View would also be different
    in each of these examples: RSS, HTML, ASCII, WrittenOnAPieceOfPaper, and so on.
    These are all simply different ways of presenting the same data, which is the
    Model. For example, our Rails application in the next chapter has Views for both
    HTML and RSS display of photographs and related information.'

    is a child of something called `ActiveRecord::Base`. Active Record is the software
    that gives Rails its intuitive database interaction. It defines Models (which
    are classes) such that each instance represents a record in a database table.
    Not only that, but the name of the table is always the plural of the class. Therefore,
    the file `exchange_rate.rb` defines a class called `ExchangeRate`, each instance
    of which is stored in a database table called `exchanges_rates`. This all takes
    place under the hood—Rails does it for you automatically, and it is even smart
