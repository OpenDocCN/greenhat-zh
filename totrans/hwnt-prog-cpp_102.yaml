- en: The Rio is an MP3 music player. I worked on some Linux software for this device.
    Each data block ends with a 16-byte control structure. I carefully laid out the
    struct statement to make sure that the block structure was correct, yet when I
    tested the program, my Rio kept losing blocks.

    to be abbreviated to make them fit into the length limits placed on them by the

    Course" turned into "Sex Int. Course."
