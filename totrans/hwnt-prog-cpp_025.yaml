    simple enough, but maybe it's too simple. So what's the length of the following
    strings?

    Then came a yelp and a crash.

- en: The service man had to see this, so he scheduled an on-site call. When he arrived,
    he noticed that the flat cable running from the computer cabinet to the modems
    had melted. All the insulation was gone, and there was nothing left but a set
    of bare wires.

- en: The service man pulled out his trusty volt ohm meter and tested the wires. There
    were 110 volts on the line! (Five volts is normal.) After a few minutes he traced
    the problem to the wall plugs. The electrician who put them in had reversed power
    and ground on one set of plugs. This improper wiring caused the ground line of
    the modem to be at 110 volts. When the modem and the computer were connected the
    result was a lot of current running through some very small lines. That caused
    the melted insulation. And when the customer touched the lines, the 110 volts
    caused the computer to bite him.
