    and little to no experience with other vector editors. These are your first baby
    steps in the new world. If you have already worked with Inkscape and think you
    can easily recreate this chapter’s final example ([Figure 2-24](ch02s10.html#life_and_its_many_faces

- en: The first question to ask yourself before installing Inkscape is whether you
    want a *stable version* or a *development build*. Stable versions have been officially
    released and have version numbers associated with them. Calling a version (for
    example, version 0.46.1) stable does not mean it’s perfect and never crashes;
    it just means this version has received a decent amount of testing, is more completely
    documented, and is what most people use. In fact, apart from its stability, the
    biggest advantage of running a stable version is that this is what other users
    run, so fellow Inkscape artists are more likely to be able to help you.
  id: totrans-3
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, I recommend that you start with a stable version, but consider upgrading
    to a development build if you find that you like Inkscape and want to support
    its development, or if you need the new features added since the release (visit
    the next version’s Release Notes on *[http://wiki.inkscape.org](http://wiki.inkscape.org)*
    to see what’s being worked on).
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a *development build* has its own distinct advantages. First of all, such
    builds have all the latest and best features, which are often quite significant
    compared to the latest stable version (especially if it’s been several months
    since the stable release). These new features often include fixes for the important
    bugs of the stable version. Also, by running the development version, you help
    the development community to discover and iron out new bugs. Naturally, active
    developers are more interested in the development version, so you’re more likely
    to receive prompt help directly from the developers.
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what about stability? Granted, development builds are, on average, buggier
    and crash more often. However, if you run into a bug that’s really driving you
    crazy—and if that bug is not fixed quickly enough—you can always go back to the
    latest stable version. (Remember to save often, no matter which version you use!)

    increments the version number by just 0.01 (for example, 0.40 was followed by
    0.41, then 0.42, and so on). Recently, several months typically pass between stable
    releases. Often, a 0.* xx *stable release is followed by a 0.* xx. *1 bugfix release
    (for example, 0.45 was followed within a month by 0.45.1), which adds no new features
    but fixes some bugs. Development builds after the 0.* xx *release are designated
    0.* xx*+svn (for example, 0.46+svn), and each build has a revision number (for
    example, r20887). You can always find out the exact version number, revision,
    and build date of your installation of Inkscape by opening **Help*** ▸ ***About**

    a segment (pie-slice shape) or elliptic arc; a 3D box can be moved and resized
    in its own 3D space. We will talk about shapes in [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Shapes");

    The Calligraphic pen is one of the most versatile tools in Inkscape; its many
    options and parameters allow it to imitate not only calligraphic pen (which was
    its original purpose), but also various brushes and many other drawing implements
    and behaviors (some of which have no counterpart in the real world). This is the
    primary tool of those who use Inkscape to *simply draw* ([Chapter 14](ch14.html

    dialogs, and shortcuts work only on those objects that are currently selected.
    Various informational displays, such as the status bar, always describe the selected
    objects. The ability to quickly and precisely select what you need, as well as
    to quickly figure out what is currently selected and where, is absolutely vital
    for effective work in Inkscape.

    the new fill color of all selected objects. Even if the object had no fill at
    all (like a path created with the Pencil tool), it becomes filled with that color
    too. (Note that you can scroll the palette to the right to see more colors than
    fit the screen.)

    limited compared to SVG, or because Inkscape’s exporter for that format is less
    than fully developed, or both. These export formats are usable, but only if you

    going to be creating at this early stage of learning Inkscape, it should be perfectly

    click black on the palette; after that, all new calligraphic paths will be black
    too. If the pen draws too wide or too thin, adjust the **Width** value on the
    tool’s controls bar above the canvas. If something turns out wrong, undo by pressing

    offers. What you have done so far would be just as easy to do in a raster editor.
    But we’re in vector, so let’s use the specific vector advantages to play with
    the result. Using Selector, select both eyes’ whites and scale them up or down.
    Or move the pupils around. Or scale, rotate, and move the mouth. All of this creates
    a wide range of facial expressions. You can also select, duplicate, and drag away
    the entire drawing to present several examples side by side:'
