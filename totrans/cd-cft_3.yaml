    mentoring, increases your focus (you are less likely to daydream, take long phone

    likely to interrupt two people working closely together than a single programmer
    staring vacantly into space). It works as an early real-time inspection mechanism—
    an instant code review—and brings the benefits of better code. It's a social process;
    with the right people, it improves morale (although it can be disastrous when
    two people grate against each other). The programmers get to know each other more

    feature's branch (for new drawing tools) and perform a number of check-ins down
    it. None of these affect code in the trunk at all. Work on the trunk continues
    concurrently, and at *version 3*, a second branch is created to accommodate the

    main code. If it was a development dead end, then you can abandon the branch—with
    no effect on the trunk. Very useful. In our example, the first branch is merged

    branch, and the product itself is released from this branch. When complete, we
    merge it back down to the trunk and create a new branch from there for the next
