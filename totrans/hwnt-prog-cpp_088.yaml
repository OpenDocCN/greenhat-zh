- en: A programmer at IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center had a problem. When he
    was sitting down, everything went fine. When he stood up, the computer failed.
    Now this problem was interesting in that it was completely repeatable. When he
    stood up, the machine always failed, and when he sat down it always worked. Nothing
    flaky about this problem.

- en: The people in the computer office were baffled. After all, how could the computer
    know when the guy was standing or sitting? All sorts of theories were floated,
    such as static electricity, magnetic fields, and even acts of a playful God.

    It was a nice theory, but unfortunately it didn't fit the facts. Loose wires tend
    to cause intermittent problems, but this was 100 percent reproducible.

- en: Finally a sharp-eyed engineer noticed something. When the programmer sat down,
    he touch typed. When he stood up, he used the hunt and peck method. A careful
    examination of the keyboard revealed that two of the keys had been reversed. This
    didn't matter when the fellow sat down and touch-typed. But when he rose and used
    the hunt-and-peck method, he was misled by the reversed keys and input the wrong
    data.
