    big it is. Even if you only read the titles of Wikipedia articles, it would take
    you most of a month, without a break, to scan all of them. If you tried the same
    with Microsoft Encarta, or any traditional encyclopedia, you could be done in
    about a day, with time left over to eat, shower, and take yourself to bed. Reading
    the *full* content of Wikipedia would take you well over two years, if you read
    continuously—and then you would have to start over, as most of the pages would
    have changed in the meantime.

    growing at an enormous rate, so this total will doubtless be much higher when
    you read this than it is as we write it (see [Figure 1-1](#wikipedias_growth_over_time
    "Figure 1-1. Wikipedia's growth over time")). By early 2008, the English-language
    Wikipedia was estimated to consist of over 960,000,000 words, which is equivalent
    to over 1,700 copies of *War and Peace* (itself about 560,000 words long in a
    standard English translation). ^([[1](#ftn.CHP-1-FNOTE-1)]) On average, another
    20 to 40 million words were being added each month, or 35 to 70 more copies of
    *War and Peace*—or one copy every 12 hours, all day, every day, continuously.

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wikipedia has tried to filter out unencyclopedic material by codifying and abiding
    by general content policies, rather than by creating a list of approved topics
    ahead of time. What can be added to the encyclopedia is not laid down in advance,
    but is decided according to some basic principles worked out in the early days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Policies determine both the kinds of topics that are acceptable and the way
    in which those topics are treated. If properly applied, the policies are designed
    to result in a fair treatment, no matter how contentious the topic. If policies
    cannot be conformed to—for example, if there are no reliable sources about a topic—then
    an attempt to create a good Wikipedia article for that particular topic may fail.
    Whether someone likes or dislikes the topic itself, however, should not have any
    bearing on whether an article is included. In other words, the only limit on what
    appears in Wikipedia is whether an article can be written that complies with all
    of the content policies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No one in particular has the job of deciding whether an article is suitable
    for Wikipedia. Rather, contributors submit new pages to the site directly, and
    they go live immediately without intermediaries. Other contributors then review
    these articles. Large numbers of new articles are deleted every day, but new content
    that conforms to the content policies is kept. (See [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html
    "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research") for how to start a new article and [Chapter 7](hw-wkpd-wk_09.html
    "Chapter 7. Cleanup, Projects, and Processes") for how articles are deleted.)
    A new article may also be edited quite savagely to make it more suitable for keeping.
    An editor who inserts content that falls outside the policies, or removes content
    that is within them, is not furthering the aims of the project.

    disagreements with these policies even in theory, that contributor will probably
    not be happy on Wikipedia.

    an article's statements can be confirmed by reliable outside sources.

    articles tend not to end with overall summary assessments of people or events.
    Conclusions from historians can be cited, but if two historians disagree, there
    should be no authorial attempt to reconcile the views; both sides should be given

    A neutral article makes no case and concentrates on informing the reader by providing
    a good survey of its topic. It is fair-minded and accurate and deals with controversial
    matters by reporting the main points where there is disagreement.'

    article on a contentious topic, such as a historical event that is seen differently
    by various groups, should not reveal where the article author stands on the matter.
    In almost all cases, such an article will have been worked over by a group of
    editors, and their opinions should not come through. Although the example of a
    rock band was given previously, there are more serious topics where maintaining
    a neutral point of view is not easy to apply. Consider a neutral treatment of
    slavery, communism, the history of Ireland, or abortion. Each of these has to
    be treated on a scrupulous basis, with proper weight given to all sides of the
    story. The discussion of rival opinions should be in a tone containing no sympathy
    or bias, regardless of the topic.'
  prefs: []

    all-inclusive. All significant views should be provided or outlined, however.
    The reasons why a particular view is popular should be given in fair summary,
    but the overall expression in an article should not be slanted. NPOV doesn't mean
    that minority views must be written about with equal coverage to majority views,
    particularly when there is a wide disparity in their acceptance; points of view
    should be written up proportionately. Small minority views, such as "the Earth
    is flat," can be treated briefly, or in some cases omitted as being below Wikipedia's
    natural threshold of attention. There is no doctrine of *equal time*. In fact,
    to give all views equal coverage regardless of their outside acceptance is in
    itself an act of editorializing. The same goes for what facts or incidents are
    emphasized in an article; a scandal, rumor, or conspiracy theory may be included
    (if properly sourced), but shouldn't be given unwarranted headline status. Wikipedia
    is not tabloid journalism.

    article should never directly include opinion within the text: "Coke is much better
    than Pepsi" is the wrong approach. Rather, the statement should be neutral, indirect,
    accurate, and specific. For example, it is acceptable to write "according to a
    2006 Taste Tester''s poll published in *Taste Testers Monthly*, 52 percent of
    taste testers found Coke to be better than Pepsi," with a full citation to the
    article being referred to. (This is a fabricated quote, by the way. See [[New

    be included. According to Verifiability and Neutral Point of View, this disputed
    factual point should appear as "Source *A* says *X* was the nephew of *Y*, whereas
    *B* says *X* was the son of *Y*," with references. According to the No Original
    Research policy, the matter should be left there, and if source C publishes some
    new evidence, this should then be added. Wikipedia is not a court in which verdicts
    are reached, and editors should not attempt to figure out the "right" answer themselves;
    an article may simply present the evidence, fairly and at adequate length, for
    the reader to consider.

    materials aren't welcome on Wikipedia because these are inherently non-neutral.

    schools, which are often used for sources, is often non-neutral and should be
    considered carefully before being cited.

    even if it's about a subject you know as intimately as your own life, needs to

    either of these is particularly well known and has been written about previously).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notability is easy to think about superficially but difficult to apply or cleanly
    define in the abstract. A feeling for notability requires a practical sense of
    the relative significance of topics in a field, and it also requires a scholarly
    sense of which types of sources determine notability. An encyclopedist has to
    wrestle with weighing the extent and quality of information available on a topic.
    To take one example, King Edward V of England, one of the princes in the Tower
    whose reign was cut short when his uncle, Richard III, took the throne, is clearly
    notable, even though much that has been written about him and his fate is speculative.

    open to debate than Verifiability, No Original Research, and Neutral Point of

    deleted from Wikipedia over time.

    is not a promotional service, and most of them fall back on whether there are
    any reliable secondary sources to be had and the amount of documentation available
    on a topic. For example, if Alice has a website that gets thousands of hits a
    day, but no one has written about it in any sort of publication, Bob will likely
    not be able to write a successful Wikipedia article about Alice's site that doesn't
    get deleted by other editors as being non-notable, or with the short dismissive
    comment *nn*.
