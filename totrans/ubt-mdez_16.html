Ubuntu is quite capable in terms of video, allowing you to view DVDs, video CDs (VCDs), video files you download from the Internet, and some Internet video streams. It also allows you to download video movie files from your digital camera, or to capture movies from tape-based digital video cameras and then edit them.</p><div class="sect1" title="Where the Apps Are"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_the_apps_are-id3"/>Where the Apps Are</h1></div></div></div><p>All of the apps in this chapter can be run from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Media</strong></span> filter button. As with all applications, you can also run an app by typing its name in the Dash’s search box and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="DVDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="dvds"/>DVDs</h1></div></div></div><p>Your system allows you to play DVDs; however, due to licensing concerns, playback is limited to unencrypted discs by default. Unfortunately, this rules out a vast majority of the DVD movies you buy or rent at your local video shop and leaves you with a limited choice of films to play on your computer. Given the limited offerings in the unencrypted DVD world, you will no doubt want to enable your system to play the encrypted variety.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0004"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 16: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_16_colon_installing_support_for"/>Project 16: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs</h1></div></div></div><p>As I already mentioned, Ubuntu does not allow you to play encrypted DVDs from the start, unless you opted to install third-party software support when you installed Ubuntu. If you did not do that, then for you to watch such DVDs (and that would be the vast majority of them), you need to install a whole bunch of stuff—most crucially the package <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdread4</em></span>. Fortunately, this has become quite easy to do now that Ubuntu tells you what you need when you need it, just as it did in the previous chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0005"/></p><p>The first step is the easiest: Insert a DVD movie disc in your disc drive. In few moments, a window will appear telling you that you have inserted a DVD (duh!) and asking you what you want to do. In the drop-down menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Movie Player</strong></span> and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. A new window will appear as Ubuntu figures out what you need to install before you can start playing DVDs. Once it is done, accept the default packages suggested in the window that appears by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> and then entering your password. Then sit back for a minute or less until the installation process is complete. Once it is, you will have successfully installed <span class="emphasis"><em>libdevread4</em></span> and a bunch of other necessary files. So now you’re ready to play your DVD, right? Well, not quite.</p><p>With just about any other application, you would be done at this point, but as you will notice, Movie Player will be open but your DVD will still not be playing. The reason is that <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdread4</em></span> requires that you also run an installation script that comes with it in order to get the job done. To run the script, open the Terminal, type the following, and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting16_d1e17141"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh</code></strong></pre><p>You will soon be prompted for your password, so type it in and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Once the Terminal returns you to the user prompt, the process will be done. Close Movie Player, reinsert the DVD movie disc in your drive, and once again select Movie Player in the window that pops up. Once you click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, Movie Player should open and start playing the DVD. (You’ll learn more about Movie Player soon.)</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Can I Play Foreign DVDs?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="can_i_play_foreign_dvds_question"/>Can I Play Foreign DVDs?</h1></div></div></div><p>Your computer can play DVDs of any broadcast standard (NTSC, PAL, or SECAM) and of any regional encoding. This is a better setup than the DVD player you have hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of standalone DVD players in the United States (I would venture to guess 99.9 percent) do not allow you to play anything other than Region 1 NTSC discs (NTSC being the broadcast standard in the United States and what US televisions are designed to display, and 1 being the DVD region). This information is usually provided on the back of DVD packages (see the examples in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on" title="Figure 16-1. Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages">Figure 16-1</a>), though the packaging for most discs produced for the US market does not include it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0010"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17183"/><img alt="Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263892.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-1. Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages</p></div><p>Despite the wonderful, everything-goes nature of your computer in terms of DVD playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the manufacturer of your DVD drive, you will be able to switch back and forth between DVDs of differing regional encodings only four or five times. After that, the drive will be locked into the regional encoding of the disc you were playing at that time . . . <span class="emphasis"><em>forever</em></span>. This is unrelated to your operating system—it is strictly a hardware matter. The only exception to this region-lock rule are those DVDs labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>Region Free</em></span> or ALL (sometimes inaccurately labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>Region 0</em></span>), which can be played on any DVD player in any region and thus do not register as a regional encoding switch when you plop one of them in your computer’s DVD drive.</p><p>If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially one for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That comes in the form of Videolan’s <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdcss2</em></span>, the library that is included in the <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdread4</em></span> package you installed in Project 16A. The <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdcss2</em></span> library allows you to play back encrypted DVDs. In addition to that primary function, <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdcss2</em></span> also, in theory, allows you to play back DVDs from multiple regions even if your DVD drive is already locked into one region. It does this by performing a cryptic attack (to use Videolan’s term for it) on your drive until it can find the disc key for that drive. Of course, this process of cryptic bombardment can take several minutes, so it is not the optimal way of going about things. It’s better than being stuck, though. Whether this process of bypassing regional encodings is legal remains a subject of debate, so if you are concerned about such things, you should do a little research.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0012"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Watching Video Files with Movie Player"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="watching_video_files_with_movie_player"/>Watching Video Files with Movie Player</h1></div></div></div><p>A number of video players are available in the Linux world.

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#movie_player" title="Figure 16-2. Movie Player">Figure 16-2</a>, Movie Player has a very simple interface and is equally simple to use.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0013"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="movie_player"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17232"/><img alt="Movie Player" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263894.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-2. Movie Player</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Movie Player to Play DVDs, VCDs, and Other Multimedia Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_movie_player_to_play_dvds_comma_vc"/>Using Movie Player to Play DVDs, VCDs, and Other Multimedia Files</h2></div></div></div><p>Because Movie Player is the default video player in Ubuntu, you can play a DVD with it by simply placing a DVD in the drive, selecting Movie Player when prompted, and clicking <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. If you’ve got a copy of <span class="emphasis"><em>Red Detachment of Women</em></span> on VCD that you’re aching to watch, you can do so in the same way. Just pop the VCD in your drive, follow the same steps, and Movie Player should start up and begin playing the disc.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0018"/></p><p>Not only does Movie Player play discs, DVDs, and VCDs, but it can also play MPEG and WMV files. Just double-click the files directly or go to the Movie Player <span class="strong"><strong>Movie</strong></span> menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>, and then navigate to the video file you want to view.

Yes, Movie Player not only does video but also does audio. You can play such files from the Movie Player <span class="strong"><strong>Movie</strong></span> menu by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> and then navigating to the songs you want to play. If you have a CD in your disc drive, you can even use Movie Player as a CD player by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Movie</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Play Disc ‘Audio Disc’</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0022"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="movie_player_as_an_audio_player"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17318"/><img alt="Movie Player as an audio player" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263896.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-3. Movie Player as an audio player</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="A Couple of Other Cool Movie Player Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a_couple_of_other_cool_movie_player_feat"/>A Couple of Other Cool Movie Player Features</h2></div></div></div><p>Movie Player has a couple more cool features that you might like to know about. One is its ability to perform screen captures of whatever video you happen to be viewing at the time. Just select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Take Screenshot</strong></span>, and you’ve got yourself a screen capture—a still image taken from a video file.</p><p>Another feature worth mentioning is Movie Player’s sidebar. As you no doubt noticed, at the bottom-right corner of the Movie Player window is a sidebar button. If you click that button, a new pane will open at the right side of the Movie Player window. In that pane you can select and listen to BBC podcasts; search for and watch YouTube videos (<a class="xref" href="ch16.html#viewing_youtube_videos_in_movie_player" title="Figure 16-4. Viewing YouTube videos in Movie Player">Figure 16-4</a>); and load, create, and save playlists. You can select these various functions from the drop-down menu at the top of the sidebar.</p><p>The playlists you create can consist of any combination of supported video or audio files, thus providing you with the whole multimedia banana. Any time you play a file in Movie Player, that file appears in the Playlist pane, but you can also add items to the list by simply dragging the files there from your desktop or any Nautilus window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0023"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_youtube_videos_in_movie_player"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17348"/><img alt="Viewing YouTube videos in Movie Player" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263898.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-4. Viewing YouTube videos in Movie Player</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="An Alternative (and Arguably Better) Video Player: VLC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="an_alternative_open_parenthesis_and_argu"/>An Alternative (and Arguably Better) Video Player: VLC</h1></div></div></div><p>Although Movie Player has made great strides since it first appeared, many users find it temperamental and quirky.

This means that people are creating their own videos more than ever, and now with the ability to share video creations with family, friends, and the rest of the world via YouTube, it’s fair to say that home digital video is just about ubiquitous.</p><p>Before you can work with your videos on your computer, you will have to transfer them from your camera. Fortunately this is pretty easy, though the process will vary slightly depending on the type of device you used to record your videos. Different devices store videos in different ways.</p><div class="sect2" title="Transferring Video Files from a Camera with a Storage Card"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="transferring_video_files_from_a_camera_w"/>Transferring Video Files from a Camera with a Storage Card</h2></div></div></div><p>Most digital cameras and dedicated digital video cameras today store your videos as files on a memory card, the most common being an SD card. Transferring your files from devices with these cards to your computer is straightforward, and there are a number of ways of going about it. While many video types can be imported via Shotwell in the same way you import photos, this sometimes does not work, depending on the file format in which the video is saved on your camera. One way that always works, however, is to just transfer the video files from your camera to computer as you would transfer files from a USB drive. Here is what you do:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Connect your camera’s USB cable to your computer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Turn on your camera in play mode.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the dialog that soon appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Open Folder</strong></span> and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A file manager window will appear.

When you want to transfer a video clip to your computer from a digital video (DV) camera that saves its data on tape or from a video stream, however, there is no way to simply drag the file from one place to another. You have to capture the video stream to disk while you play it, and to do that, you need some sort of software solution. This is usually found in the form of a video editor; however, not all video editors have this capability. One that does have this capability and does the job easily is Kino (<a class="xref" href="ch16.html#kino_comma_another_digital_video_editor" title="Figure 16-6. Kino, another digital video editor">Figure 16-6</a>).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0029"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="kino_comma_another_digital_video_editor"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17466"/><img alt="Kino, another digital video editor" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263902.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-6. Kino, another digital video editor</p></div><p>Kino does not come bundled with Ubuntu, so you’ll need to download and install it from the Ubuntu Software Center.

In that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Choose File</strong></span> button and give your new film a title in the <span class="strong"><strong>Choose file to render to</strong></span> window. This will be the name of the actual file that will be produced. Once done, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span> button. The progress of the rendering process will be shown in the Render project window, and when it is done, the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering Complete</em></span> will appear. You can then close the Render project window and PiTiVi as well. Be sure to save your project when prompted to do so.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0035"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0037"/></p><p>For more detailed information on using PiTiVi, have a look at the user manual, which is available from the PiTiVi site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pitivi.org/">http://www.pitivi.org/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Other Video Apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="other_video_apps"/>Other Video Apps</h1></div></div></div><p>I’ve covered the main video applications in Ubuntu, but there are still others that you might want to consider, all of which are available via the Ubuntu Software Center. If you are interested in yet another alternative video/DVD player, you can try GNOME MPlayer, which has long had a significant following because of its ability to handle numerous video formats.</p><p>Another cool application for video streaming enthusiasts is Miro Internet TV (<a class="xref" href="ch16.html#miro_comma_a_videostreaming_enthusiastas" title="Figure 16-12. Miro, a videostreaming enthusiast’s dream">Figure 16-12</a>), which allows you to easily search, download, and play online video streams. Just perform an Ubuntu Software Center search for <span class="emphasis"><em>miro</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0038"/></p><p>If you have a webcam, you might want to try an application called Cheese, which allows you take pictures and videos from your webcam and add cool graphical effects. Camorama is another webcam viewer/capture application to consider.</p><div class="figure"><a id="miro_comma_a_videostreaming_enthusiastas"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e17680"/><img alt="Miro, a videostreaming enthusiast’s dream" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263914.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-12. Miro, a videostreaming enthusiast’s dream</p></div><p>If you’re looking for an alternative to PiViTi and Kino, you can try Avidemux. One very handy feature makes it worth having, even if you don’t use it as your main video editor: It can rip audio tracks from video files. If stop-motion animation video is your thing, then be sure to also check out Stopmotion.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0039"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0040"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0043"/></p><p>For those of you interested in ripping DVDs, DVD:Rip, AcidRip DVD Ripper, and the less daunting Thoggen DVD Ripper are worth checking out. You might also be interested in DVD95 and the more highly configurable K9copy, which are the Linux world’s answers to DVDShrink. These applications allow you to rip dual-layer DVDs (DVD9) and compress the output so that it will fit on a single-layer blank DVD disc (DVD5). For creating your own DVDs from scratch (as you would with iDVD), a couple of applications are worth considering: DVD Styler and Bombono DVD.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0044"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-0045"/></p></div></div></body></html>
