- en: BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is the most widely used DNS server application
    on the Internet. Slightly over 79 percent of DNS servers use BIND DNS, according
    to a survey conducted by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) in July 2007\.
    Microsoft came in second at 16 percent.^([[]](#CHP-10-1)) The domain name system
    is responsible for the conversion of domain names, such as [http://unorthodocs.net](http://unorthodocs.net),
    into routable IP addresses like 69.226.238.99\. It is considered one of the most
    critical components of the Internet.

- en: BIND version 9 was a total rewrite of the BIND package that addressed architectural
    issues and known security problems in previous versions. New features in BIND
    9 include DNS Security (DNSSEC), multiprocessor support, support for IPv6, protocol
    enhancements, and better portability.

- en: BIND also supports dynamic DNS updates (as per RFC 2136). When coupled with
    the Internet Systems Consortium's DHCP server, dynamic DNS allows real-time updates
    to the DNS server's zone files as DHCP clients join the network. This gives DHCP
    clients the luxury of having a locally or publicly resolvable hostname.

- en: BIND was originally conceived as a graduate student project at the University
    of California, Berkeley in the early '80s. UC Berkeley worked on BIND in cooperation
    with Digital Equipment Corporation for a few years. Paul Vixie, of Digital Equipment
    Corporation, later became principal programmer of the BIND project. BIND was passed
    on to the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), a nonprofit corporation led by Vixie,
    who now continues to develop the BIND system independently.

- en: 'We''ll be building a local master authoritative name server for your domain
    name. This will also provide the benefits of a caching name server. A caching
    name server is basically a DNS relay: It has no zone files of its own and must
    get DNS information from other DNS servers (also called forwarders). Both authoritative
    and caching name servers store DNS queries in a cache to make subsequent requests
    faster.'

- en: A master authoritative name server also has a zone file (a list of known IP
    addresses) for your domain. When a DNS query is received for your domain, BIND
    looks at your zone file and returns the requested information. If the query is
    for a domain other than yours, the query is forwarded to other DNS servers specified
    in your forwarder's configuration.
