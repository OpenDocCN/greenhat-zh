<i class="calibre11">Getting Down to Business in Linux</i><a name="665" id="665"/><a name="IDX-207" id="IDX-207"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Well, I admit it; I’ve been leading you on a  totally hedonistic, fun-and-games, pleasure- above-all-else, wild ride through the world of  Linux, with barely a mention of anything  suggestive of the workplace . . . or even of work,  for that matter. I am, after all, trying to get you to see  that Linux is a warm and fuzzy, fun and friendly operating  system. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">All this focus on fun doesn’t mean, however, that Linux isn’t capable behind the  desk. Linux can get down to business and do it as well as the next OS. I think it’s safe  to say that you are missing nothing and are probably gaining quite a bit in terms of  home and office productivity programs in the world of Linux. In this chapter, I’ll  walk you through the Linux offerings in this department.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Whether they should be or not, people are quite obsessed with office suites, even  though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The de facto  standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in both the  Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, as it is a Microsoft product, you can  be quite sure that there is no Linux version available. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fortunately, Linux does have an exceedingly capable office suite in the form  of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in “free”) in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some lightweight sour- grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a full-featured  contender, and in some cases, such as its onscreen font rendering, OpenOffice.org is a clear winner.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Like most other office suites, OpenOffice.org consists of a word processor, a  spreadsheet program, a presentation program, and a couple of other programs.  The main three applications are compatible with their Microsoft Office  equivalents (Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, respectively) in terms of  both reading and writing files, and as the basic look and feel of these applications  is fairly similar to Microsoft Office, switching over to the OpenOffice.org applications should be relatively easy. If you don’t have any experience with  Microsoft Office, you should still find it all pretty straightforward, as the basic  layout is pretty intuitive. And if you are lacking in the intuition department, the  built-in help files are pretty good, too.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get OpenOffice.org up and running, launch the application you wish to use (I’d recommend the word processor for now) by going to the Main menu,  selecting <b class="calibre13">Office</b>, and then selecting the office application of your choice.  Remember that the launchers for the word processor and spreadsheet should  still be on your panel too.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have started one of the OpenOffice.org programs, I suggest turning on  OpenOffice.org’s Tips function to help you along the way as you take a further  look at the applications that make up the OpenOffice.org suite. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">OpenOffice.org’s Tips system is just like similar systems in the Windows and Mac  worlds. In fact, you have a similar feature in the GNOME environment, though it  doesn’t carry through to OpenOffice.org. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In case you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, tips are those little yellow  boxes that pop up to tell you what a button or menu item does when you place  your mouse over that button or menu item. <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU154">Figure 15-1</a> shows the two types of  tips available in OpenOffice.org applications: the usual short variety and the  more verbose extended variety. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To activate Tips, go to the <b class="calibre13">Help</b> menu and select <b class="calibre13">Tips</b>, and if you prefer a bit  more verbiage, select <b class="calibre13">Extended Tips </b>as well.<a name="669" id="669"/><a name="IDX-208" id="IDX-208"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have Tips activated, you should have no trouble figuring out what  the various buttons and menu items in the OpenOffice.org applications do.  There are, however, a few buttons that most likely require, or at least deserve, a  bit more explanation (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU155">Figure 15-2</a>). </p>
<div class="calibre10">

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 15-2: </span> The Function toolbar in OpenOffice.org </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The first odd button is situated just to the left of the printer icon. This is the PDF  button, and you can use it to export your document as a PDF file. This button is a  new feature in OpenOffice.org 1.1.0, though the actual PDF-creating function  was present in previous versions of OpenOffice.org via the Print dialog box. As  mentioned in <a href="DDU0047_split_000.html#275" target="_parent">Chapter 6</a>, PDF files can still be created via the Print dialog box in  OpenOffice.org version 1.1.0.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There are four other strange-looking buttons at the right end of the toolbar  shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU155">Figure 15-2</a>. These four buttons are all actually toggle switches,  meaning that they open a certain window when clicked and then close the same  window when clicked again. From left to right, these buttons toggle the  Navigator window, the Stylist window, the Hyperlink window, and the Gallery.</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Navigator window</b> The Navigator window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU156">Figure 15-3</a> on the next  page) is a pretty cool navigational feature that comes in handy when working  with lengthy or otherwise complex documents. Navigator allows you to easily  bounce back and forth between pages in a document, or even between elements therein. Let’s say that you have a document with lots of illustrations in  it (like this chapter), and you want to jump directly from graphic to graphic.  In this case, you would click the word <b class="calibre13">Graphics</b> in the main pane of the Navigator window and then click the jump buttons (the odd little buttons to the  left of the page number selector) to begin jumping.<a name="672" id="672"/><a name="IDX-209" id="IDX-209"/>

<b class="calibre13">Stylist window</b> The Stylist window allows you to apply various styles (chapter headings, paragraph styles, numbering, and so on) to sections of text. </p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Hyperlink window</b> The Hyperlink window allows you to assign links to spec- ified documents — not only to Web pages, but also to documents on an individual computer. While a hyperlink on a Web page is something we have all  come to take for granted, the idea of hyperlinking between text documents  sounds like a pretty radical concept. It is, in fact, a rather old one that has  been around since before you or I had even heard of the Internet. </p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Gallery</b> The Gallery is a library of graphical elements for use in your documents or Web pages (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU157">Figure 15-4</a>). These elements range from various  lines to buttons to colored three-dimensional doughnuts, and you can even  add your own.</p>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 15-4: </span> The Gallery</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Inserting a graphic into your document is a simple enough task even when not  using the Gallery. All you need to do is go to the <b class="calibre13">Insert</b> menu, select <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  From File</b>, and then locate the image file you want to insert. It is handier to use  the Gallery, however, when you intend to use certain graphics frequently. Once  in the Gallery, your graphics are always only a click or two away and can be conveniently viewed in the Gallery browser window. <a name="675" id="675"/><a name="IDX-210" id="IDX-210"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Adding your own graphics to the Gallery is also relatively easy to do. First you have to create a new category (called a <i class="calibre11">theme</i>) for each group of images you wish  to add. To create a Gallery theme of your own, just click the <b class="calibre13">New Theme</b> button in the Gallery window. This will open the New Theme Properties window, where  you should first click the <b class="calibre13">General</b> tab and give your theme a name. Once you’ve  done that, click the <b class="calibre13">Files</b> tab, and then the <b class="calibre13">Find Files</b> button, which will bring up  a Select path window. From there you can navigate to the folder in which you are  storing your clip art, photos, or other graphics. Once you have found the folder,  click the <b class="calibre13">Select</b> button, after which a list of all the files in that folder will appear  in New Theme Properties window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, you can easily add images to your new Gallery theme by clicking on the  name of each image you wish to add (you might want to make sure that <b class="calibre13">Preview </b>is checked to make things a bit easier), and then clicking the <b class="calibre13">Add</b> button. Once  you have done that, a copy of the image will immediately appear in the Gallery  browser, where it will remain for future use. To use one of the images in the gallery, just right-click on the image you wish to insert into your document, and  then select <b class="calibre13">Copy</b> or <b class="calibre13">Link</b> in the pop-up menu.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The entire OpenOffice.org office suite consists of five applications: a word  processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation creator and player  (Impress), a vector drawing program (Draw), and a mathematical formula editor  (Math). All of these applications can be accessed by going to the Main menu and  selecting <b class="calibre13">Office</b>. In addition, Panel launchers for the main three applications (Writer, Impress, and Calc) are available in the default Fedora Core setup,  though you probably removed the Impress launcher while following along with  <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>. <a name="677" id="677"/><a name="IDX-211" id="IDX-211"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s look briefly at each of the applications, though as I’m a bit of a mathematics dunce, I don’t think I will venture into the realm of what you can do with Math.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned earlier, the word processor is the office application that the  majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, OpenOffice.org Writer is a  good one (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU158">Figure 15-5</a> on the previous page). It is chock-full of features  and can even read and save Microsoft Word files. Like Word, it will even let you  save your pages as HTML files so that you can easily change your documents into  Web pages. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I said, Writer is a very straightforward word processor, so I won’t go on  about it, but if you would like to see a little intro on using Writer, check out the  first steps tutorial at the OpenOffice.org Web site (<a target="_top" href="http://www.openoffice.org/writerfirststeps/writerfirststeps.html">www.openoffice.org/writerfirststeps/writerfirststeps.html</a>).</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Calc is the OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application, and it is similar to Excel in  terms of capabilities and general layout (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU159">Figure 15-6</a>). It can also, quite  importantly, read and save Microsoft Excel files.</p>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 15-6: </span> A spreadsheet created in OpenOffice.org Calc</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As most people who use spreadsheets generally understand what they are all  about and, after a bit of poking around, can figure out how to use them, I won’t  go into any sort of primer about using Calc. However, as there are many others  who don’t see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will mention a few of the  simpler things that can be done with Calc, in the hope of enticing some of you  into trying it.<a name="682" id="682"/><a name="IDX-212" id="IDX-212"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Most people who don’t use spreadsheets think of them as a sort of giant  calculator used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, like payrolls  (which was the original purpose of such applications). That’s right, of course,  but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too, such as projecting house- hold budgets, calculating grade point averages (for teacher or student), figuring  out how long it will take you to save up for your trip to Hungary, or even for  something as weird as comparing the seat heights for the four or five motorcycles  you are trying to choose among. And when doing any of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs in order to make all the abstract  numbers speak to you visibly.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating lists of  information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, address lists . . .  whatever. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order, or sort  them by date of birth, and so on.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Impress (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU160">Figure 15-7</a>) is OpenOffice.org’s answer to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, with  which it is compatible. It allows you to create graphically attractive slides for use  in presentations and also allows you to create notes or handouts to accompany  them. While these features make Impress quite handy in business and education  settings, you may not find it of as of much value as a home user. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">More useful to the home user is OpenOffice.org Draw. Although Draw isn’t all  that great a program for creating true graphics in the art sense, it is very useful  for creating flowcharts, organizational diagrams (like seating arrangements for  wedding receptions or conferences), or any other document in which you want a  bit more control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the  two are combined), such as for fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this  sense, OpenOffice.org Draw can be used quite effectively as a simple page layout  program, as you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU161">Figure 15-8</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, we come to OpenOffice.org’s Math. As I am a bit out of it in terms of  math, I can’t really tell you much more about Math other than it is a mathematics  formula editor that allows you to produce complex mathematical formulae and  then paste them as embedded objects into other OpenOffice.org programs. It is  strictly an editor and does not calculate. I think I am safe in saying that most  common folk have no need for it in their everyday lives, unless, of course, you  write Math textbooks for a living.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There is yet another free office suite in the Linux world called KOffice, which is  the KDE office suite that is also included in Fedora Core. I’ve never found much  use for KOffice, as it is not as intuitive to use as one would expect, and it comes  with a lot of rather useless extras that just waste space, at least in my mind. <a name="690" id="690"/><a name="IDX-214" id="IDX-214"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">AbiWord used to have the distinction of being the only true cross-platform word  processor because it came in Linux, Mac, and Windows versions. This, along with  the fact that it was free, meant that many people used it. However, now that  OpenOffice.org is also available on all three platforms (and is equally free),  AbiWord has lost its claim to fame in that regard. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Nevertheless, AbiWord still has its place in the total scheme of things. Most  importantly, AbiWord is fairly quick. After all, there may be some of you who  don’t really need all the power of Writer (at least not all of the time) and would  prefer something that pops up as soon as you click the launcher, and that doesn’t  take more than a minute or so to figure out how to use (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU162">Figure 15-9</a>). </p>

</div>
<a name="693" id="693"/><a name="IDX-215" id="IDX-215"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">AbiWord has a very straightforward and easy-to-use interface, which you should  be able to figure out without much, if any, help. It also has a couple of rather  interesting features, such as its auto-resize function, which magnifies the  onscreen document size (fonts, images, and everything) or shrinks it as you  increase or decrease the size of the program window. Another is AbiWord’s ability to read and save files in an amazing number of formats, including  Microsoft Word (.doc), OpenOffice.org Writer (.sxw), and many other familiar  (and some unfamiliar) formats.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you have used AbiWord in the Linux environment in the past, then you  may have come away from AbiWord less than pleased with its absolutely dreadful  onscreen font rendering. I personally found the look so annoying that I couldn’t  stand using it. Fortunately, things have changed. Fonts now look quite good (though not as good as the absolutely beautiful onscreen font rendering in  OpenOffice.org), as does the whole interface, which has been, shall we say,  totally GNOME-ized. All around, AbiWord is just plain better.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can easily install AbiWord with APT/Synaptic. Just run Synaptic, type <span>abiword</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box, and then . . . well, you know the drill by now.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition to the traditional office suite applications, there are a number of  other applications included with your system that can be grouped together  under the “productivity” label. You’ve already heard mention of (and perhaps  even installed) the Linux home finance program, GnuCash, but there are many  other applications that are installed and available to you, such as the following:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Gcalctool, a calculator with both basic and scientific modes (from the Main  menu select <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Calculator</b>)</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition to these more or less standard utilities, there are also some other  rather interesting applications installed on your system. One of these is KTimer,  which allows you to run a command at the end of a given time period (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU163">Figure  15-10</a>). For example, let’s say that you want to make sure that you take a break  from your work every hour so as to keep yourself sane. You can set up KTimer so that it will bring up your favorite game, Xmahjongg, in one hour by selecting the  number of seconds in the <b class="calibre13">Delay</b> box (3,600 seconds is an hour), checking the  <b class="calibre13">Loop</b> checkbox (if you want this to happen again and again, every hour), and entering the command you desire to be executed (xmahjongg in this example).  You can run KTimer by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  More Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> KTimer</b>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another fun and handy application is KJots (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU164">Figure 15-11</a>). KJots is a notepad  of sorts, and it is organized into books and pages. Books are general topic areas  that you create, and they are filled with pages, where you write, or jot down, your  notes. There is also a Hotlist section at the bottom of the window, where you can  place buttons that take you directly to those books you need most often. All in all, it’s a very simple piece of software, but once you start using it, you’ll find that it is  quite useful.

<a name="699" id="699"/><a name="IDX-217" id="IDX-217"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the most useful non–office applications is one you are already familiar  with: File Roller. You’ve untarred a number of tarballs with the assistance of File  Roller while doing the projects in this book. However, until now you haven’t  learned how to use it to create a tarball of your own. Let’s change that right now.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You might be wondering why on earth you would want to create a tarball.  Well, let’s say that you want to send a document and a couple of images to a  friend of yours via email. The files you want to send come to a total of 669KB,  which would make a somewhat lengthy upload and download via a modem  connection. To bring this size down a bit, and to make things easier to manage  on the receiving end, you can pack these all together in a tarball.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To make your tarball (or ZIP file), go to the Main menu and select  <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> File Roller</b>. This will open the now-familiar File Roller window. In  that window, click the<b class="calibre13"> New</b> button. A New Archive window will open. With this  window, you are first going to create an empty archive, into which you can later  place the files you wish to pack together. Type a name for the archive, and type <span>.zip</span> as the extension if you are sending the file to a Windows user, or <span>.tar.gz</span> if  you are sending it to another Linux user (Linux and Mac users should actually be  able to deal with either type of archive). Once you’ve done that, click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and  the still-empty archive will be created.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The easiest way to fill your archive with files is to just drag the files you want  to the File Roller window of your new archive. You can add the files one by one, or you can add them by dragging and dropping an entire folder. Once you do  this, File Roller will archive the files, and the new additions will appear in the File  Roller window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU165">Figure 15-12</a>). Oh, and don’t worry, your original files will  still be where they were — safe and untouched.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the files appear in that window, you are done, and you can close File Roller  and send your archived file to your friend. Note, however, that sometimes when  the first item you drag to the archive is a folder, it will not appear in the archive  window until you add yet another file, even though it is in fact there. This is a  quirk in File Roller, but it is just superficial, so if the only item you are going to  archive is a folder, worry not. You cannot save an empty archive, so if your archive  appears in your folder or subfolders, you know you were successful.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While we are still dealing with the serious side of things, we might as well make  brief mention of viruses. It is true that most of the viruses that make the news are  aimed at Windows systems and make use of Windows versions of Outlook and  Outlook Express email clients to spread themselves far and wide. This does not  mean, however, that Linux is immune to viruses. Because many Linux users think  that viruses only happen to Windows, Linux systems are often unprotected and  are an attractive potential target, especially as the number of Linux users  continues to grow. There is also always the possibility that your system may be  used a way station of sorts, passing a virus from someone else to one of your  associates (and guess who’ll get the blame). So, while you really don’t have too  much to worry about yet, it is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As Windows is the number one target of viruses, the number of virus- scanning applications for Windows is far greater than the number for Linux. Of  these Linux applications, many are somewhat cumbersome for the beginner to  use, and most require you to pay for the right to use them. One program, called  F-Prot Antivirus, by an Icelandic company called Frisk Software International (<a target="_top" href="http://www.f-prot.com">www.f-prot.com</a>), however, is available for free for “personal users on personal  workstations.” If you are part of the readership I had in mind, then this means  that F-Prot Antivirus is free for you. F-Prot Antivirus comes as an RPM file and is  thus very easy to install. It is also very easy to use, even though it is run from the  Linux Command Terminal and, thus, has no graphical interface.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="705" id="705"/><a name="IDX-219" id="IDX-219"/>Before using F-Prot Antivirus, it is probably best that you update its virus database  so that you can catch the newest of the viral meanies. To do this, you use an  update script that is installed along with F-Prot Antivirus. Open a Terminal  window, become root with the <b class="calibre13">su</b> command, type <span>/usr/local/f-prot/tools/check-updates.pl</span>, and press ENTER. The script will then contact the F-Prot server, check  for updated virus information, download whatever there is available, and then  install it — while, of course, telling you everything it is doing along the way.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have updated the virus database, you are ready to use F-Prot  Antivirus. As I already mentioned, F-Prot Antivirus is command driven, but the  commands themselves are quite simple. The basic command structure consists  of the main command, <b class="calibre13">f-prot</b>, plus the directory or files you want to scan. For  example, if you want to scan your entire hard disk to see if you have any viruses  there, you first become root, and then type <span>f-prot /</span> and press ENTER. F-Prot then scans your entire hard disk to check for known viruses. This will probably take,  depending on the speed of your system and the number of files on it, around  30 minutes, so you had better do it while having lunch. When the scanning is  complete, F-Prot Antivirus will show you its results, as in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU166">Figure 15-13</a>.</p>
<div class="calibre10">
<a name="706" id="706"/><a name="figure.DDU166" id="figure.DDU166"/><span><a href="1513_0.jpg" name="IMG_170" target="_parent" id="IMG_170"><img src="1513.jpg" alt="Click To expand" border="0" class="calibre150"/></a></span>
<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 15-13: </span> The results of an F-Prot Antivirus scan </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see, F-Prot Antivirus tells you how many files it scanned, how  long it took to do so, how many of those files were suspicious (meaning files that seemed odd to F-Prot, but did not match up with any known virus in the  database), and how many were actually infected. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the problems with the simple command string used in the previous  example is that F-Prot Antivirus will give you no feedback while it is doing its business — you will see nothing in the Terminal until F-Prot is finished, it  displays its results, and your user prompt reappears. I find this a bit disconcerting, so I prefer to add the <b class="calibre13">-list</b> flag to the <b class="calibre13">f-prot </b>command, which makes  F-Prot show you every file it is scanning while it is doing so. This reassures you  that F-Prot is doing what it is supposed to be doing (and gives you some indication of its progress).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If this sounds better to you, open a Terminal window, become root, type this  command, and press ENTER:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">f-prot -list /<a name="708" id="708"/><a name="IDX-220" id="IDX-220"/>
</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you only want to scan your Home folder, then type this version of the  command and press ENTER:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">f-prot -list /home/username/</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can also scan just a single file, if you like, by using this version of the  command:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">f-prot /home/username/mysuspiciousfile.xxx</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, in this last version I left the <b class="calibre13">-list</b> flag out, as there is only one file being  scanned. No need to show a list of F-Prot’s progress when you already know the  file it is scanning.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">That is all easy enough. However, all you have done is scan your disk to look  for viruses. If you want F-Prot Antivirus to disinfect any infected files it finds, you  need to add yet another flag to the command string, <b class="calibre13">-disinf</b>. To use the <b class="calibre13">-disinf </b>flag along with your command, you just need to type the following and press  ENTER: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">f-prot -disinf -list /</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When F-Prot finds a file in need of disinfection, it will first seek your okay before  doing so.<a name="709" id="709"/><a name="IDX-221" id="IDX-221"/>
