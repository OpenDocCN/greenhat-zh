    the size of everything that appears on your monitor. A high resolution (such as
    1024 by 768) gives you more desktop area to work with, but it makes everything
    appear a bit smaller. A low resolution (such as 640 by 480) makes everything bigger
    and easier to see, but it also gives you much less desktop space to work in. You
    may also find that certain monitors just look better at certain resolutions than
    at others. An LCD monitor that I just hooked up to one my machines looked really
    flat and blurry at 800 by 600, but when I changed it to 1024 by 768, it was beautiful.

    basic color level is 256 colors; this is sometimes called 8-bit color, as the
    computer must send eight bits of data to create one pixel on the screen. However,
    if you want to view graphics, especially photos, a color depth of 256 colors will
    cause those images to look muddy and blotchy. In this case, it is better to increase
    your color depth to thousands of colors (called 16-bit color), which should be
    more than enough.'

    to stick with the metaphor, the reason is gas mileage, so to speak. Basically,
    the more information you have to send to your screen, the more computing power
    and memory you use, and that slows things down. Consequently, a computer running
    a text-only, black-and-white system (a 1-bit system) would be considerably faster
    than the same computer running an 8-bit color system, which would be faster than
    16-bit color, which would be faster than 32-bit color.

    in Fedora and it is thus a bit more developed (at least in Fedora). And finally,
    I just like it better in terms of look, feel, and convenience (after all, it has
    the ever-useful Nautilus emblems and CD Burner). If you really want to hear more

    vulnerability, add some feature, or add additional hardware support (such as support
    for more recent digital camera models). Depending on what your needs, concerns,

    out in that chapter, using Synaptic is a very easy way to keep your system up
    to date. It also has the additional advantage of allowing you to update not only
    the standard Fedora RPM packages, but also those non-Fedora add-on RPMs, such

    time and peace of mind to just order the installation CDs from one of the services

    always a very good idea to back up the data on your machine. Once you’ve done

    Fedora Core in the form of ISOs from the Internet. Most download sites also provide
    what is called a *checksum*, or *md5sum*, file that you can use to check the integrity
    of the downloaded ISOs. The question most newbies have, however, is how to check
    the integrity of their newly downloaded ISOs with that file.

    followed by the name of the command, application, or utility you want to find
    out about. For example, to see the man page for the **cp** (copy) command, you

    look at it, its function is to allow you to run Windows apps without having Windows
    installed on your machine. That said, it is only fair to point out that Wine is
    still a work in progress. It works fairly well with some programs and not at all
    with others. There are some commercial versions of Wine that might work better
    in some cases (check out the links on the Wine homepage —[www.winehq.org](http://www.winehq.org)),
    but there’s no harm in giving the free official version a try first, especially
