    good news is that Linux can match anything that your previous operating system
    could do online, and in many cases it can do it faster or more easily. Ubuntu
    was born on the Web, so it should be no surprise that it comes with a very healthy
    suite of Internet-ready applications right out of the box.

    with old stalwarts like the web browser and email client, tour briefly through
    instant messaging, and then head off in the more modish direction of Twitter and

    increasing popularity in not only the Linux world but in the Windows and Mac worlds
    as well. Chances are you are already a Firefox user, but if you are not, then
    you needn't worry—things work more or less the same in all browsers. That being
    the case, you should be able to use Firefox's basic features without any instruction.
    Of course, some of its features do distinguish Firefox from its competition, so
    I will mention those.

- en: Usually when you click a link on a web page, the new page opens in the same
    window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a new, separate
    window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a new window by right-clicking
    the link and then selecting the Open Link in New Window option. This can be very
    useful; however, once you have more than a few browser windows open, it gets sort
    of hard to find what you're looking for in all those open windows. It can also
    slow things down a bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where Firefox's tab feature comes in handy (so handy, in fact, that
    almost every other browser out there has copied it). To see how it works, try
    it yourself right here and now. Open your Firefox browser by clicking the launcher
    on the top GNOME panel (or selecting **Applications** ▸ **Internet** ▸ **Firefox
    Web Browser**); then search for the word *nyckelharpa* using Firefox's handy search
    box, which is at the top-right corner of the browser window (see [Figure 5-1](ch05.html#performing_a_google_search_from_the_fire
    "Figure 5-1. Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box")). By default,
    Firefox will perform searches for keywords entered in the search box using Google.
    You can, if you like, select other websites to search by clicking the colored
    *g* icon in the search box and then making your selection. Amazon.com, eBay, and
    Yahoo! are available, to name a few, and you can even add others. For now, however,
    let's stick to Google for our present search, by typing **`nyckelharpa`** in that
    search box. Once you've finished typing, press the **enter** key, after which
    a page of search results should appear in the main pane of the Firefox window.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the top results should be the American Nyckelharpa Association, and you
    are now going to open that page in a new tab, rather than in the same or a new
    window. To do that, right-click the link, and in the pop-up menu that appears,
    select **Open Link in New Tab**. You can, if you prefer, make things a tad easier
    and dispense with the pop-up menu selection step by simply clicking the link with
    the middle mouse button (or with both mouse buttons simultaneously) or by holding
    down the **ctrl** key as you click the link. Either way, the new page will appear
    in a new tab, while your original page of search results remains, ready and waiting
    in the other tab (see [Figure 5-2](ch05.html#a_link_opened_in_a_new_tab_in_firefox
    "Figure 5-2. A link opened in a new tab in Firefox")). I am pretty confident in
    saying that, once you get used to this feature, you will wonder how you ever got
    along without it.

    from Boing Boing, the aptly subtitled "directory of wonderful things" ([http://www.boingboing.net/](http://www.boingboing.net/)).
    Fortunately, Firefox has a neat way of dealing with your information overload,
    called *live bookmarks* (also known as *RSS feeds*). These provide you with an
    automatically updated list of articles from any website that supports them. To
    see an example, click the **Latest Headlines** link underneath Firefox's address

    bubble icon, and choose a different status (Away or Busy, for example) from the

    pastime. There are millions upon millions of blogs out there covering all sorts

    varies wildly, but for the most part blog entries are typical newspaper-opinion-column
    types of pieces. So, what if you had a blog where you were forced to write everything
    you wanted to say in less than 140 characters? That is the idea behind microblogging:
    making frequent, very short, bulletin-like posts.'

    other users, write posts using your mobile phone . . . the list goes on. I just
    followed a Twitter conversation between a few of my friends who were watching
    a live hockey game. They sent messages every time something exciting happened,

    website to see how things work. The basic idea is that you post messages (*tweets*)
    for your *followers* to see. People can choose to follow you by clicking a button
    when they view your user profile. You can choose to follow other people too—when
    you do this, all of their tweets will be displayed on your Twitter home page for
    you to read. Most people follow a few people and typically have a handful of followers
