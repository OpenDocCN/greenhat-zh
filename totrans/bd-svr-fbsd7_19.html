<p class="docText1"><a name="The" class="calibre8" id="The"/>The <span class="docEmphasis1"><a name="Printing System" class="calibre8" id="Printing System"/>Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)</span><a name="printing system" class="calibre8" id="printing system"/> is an open source printing system that provides a common interface to support printers in Unix-based systems. It also provides a standardized and modular platform that allows the use of external filters like Foomatic and Ghostscript for expanded printer compatibility. CUPS is licensed under the GNU GPL and has become the standard printing system for a large number of Linux distributions as well as Mac OS X.<a name="IDX-CHP-6-0111" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0111"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0112" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0112"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0113" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0113"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0114" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0114"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0115" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0115"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0116" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0116"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="of a" class="calibre8" id="of a"/>CUPS is composed of a print spooler, filters, and backends. It uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to accept print jobs from clients on the network. The print data is then stored in a print spool or queue until the printer is ready to accept a print job. When the printer is ready, CUPS sends the print job through filters that convert the print job data into a language the printer understands. The converted data then travels through a backend to the intended printer. Common backends include Universal Serial Bus (USB) and parallel interfaces.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="PostScript was" class="calibre8" id="PostScript was"/>Most printers communicate using either PostScript or Printer Control Language (PCL). PostScript was developed at Adobe Systems in the mid-1980s to create a standard language for both document exchange and printer communication. CUPS can print to virtually all printers that support PostScript. However, PostScript printers are notoriously expensive due to the cost of licensing the technology from Adobe. PCL was created by Hewlett-Packard in 1984 and didn't carry the licensing restrictions of PostScript. This has created a large market of low cost PCL printers. To support this large market, projects like Gimp-Print were started to develop Unix drivers for PCL printers. HP has responded to the need for Unix-based drivers with the Hewlett-Packard Inkjet Driver Project. Gimp-Print and the HP Inkjet Driver Project greatly expand CUPS support for non-PostScript printers.<a name="IDX-CHP-6-0117" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0117"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0118" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0118"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0119" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0119"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="Michael Sweet" class="calibre8" id="Michael Sweet"/>CUPS was created by Michael Sweet and first released in 1999 by Easy Software Products, a company he co-founded with Andrew Senft. CUPS was originally designed around the 30-year-old Line Printing Daemon (LPD) protocol common in Unix systems. The emergence of IPP ultimately resulted in the switch from the LPD protocol to the more scalable IPP protocol.<a name="IDX-CHP-6-0120" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0120"/><a name="IDX-CHP-6-0121" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-6-0121"/></p>
