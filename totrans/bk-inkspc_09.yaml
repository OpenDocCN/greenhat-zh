    arrows, connectors, and so on—are very common in technical drawings such as drafts
    or flowcharts. A sizable share of all SVG style properties control the appearance
    of stroke, which therefore deserves a chapter of its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While stroking in SVG is quite rich and adequate for a lot of purposes, some
    things you may be looking for are simply not there, or are only available via
    workarounds. In particular, SVG stroke always has *constant width* (it cannot
    get wider or narrower along the path); to emulate variable-width stroke, use the
    Calligraphic pen (**[14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool](ch14s03.html "14.3 The Calligraphic
    Pen Tool")**) or path effects (**[13.1 Path Effects](ch13s01.html "13.1 Path Effects")**).
    Also, while stroke can have a dash pattern (**[9.4 Dash Patterns](ch09s04.html
    "9.4 Dash Patterns")**) and markers attached to its nodes (**[9.5 Markers](ch09s05.html
    "9.5 Markers")**), you cannot stroke a path with a brush or repeated pattern that
    would follow the bends of the stroke— although, again, this is possible via path
    effects (**[13.1.3 Pattern Along Path and Bend](ch13s01.html#one3dot1dot3_pattern_along_path_and_bend
    "13.1.3 Pattern Along Path and Bend")**), and you can always apply the standard
    SVG rectangular pattern (**[10.8.1 Creating Patterns](ch10s08.html#one0dot8dot1_creating_patterns
    "10.8.1 Creating Patterns")**) to paint a stroke exactly as you would a fill (however,
    the pattern in this case is simply superimposed; it is not distorted to follow
    the trajectory of the stroke).

    above and to the left of the 45-degree line from the swatch makes the stroke in
    selected objects wider (up to twice the original width); dragging below and to
    the right makes it narrower (down to half the original width). For example, if
    you start with a 1 px stroke, dragging up and to the left will give you 2 px,

    averaged value). Now, if you set any width via the right-click menu, the same
    width will be assigned to all selected objects that had any stroke in the first
    place. (For example, if one of the objects has 3 px stroke and the other has no
    stroke, it will display *3* as its stroke width and *Different* in the swatch

    200 percent and press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735344.png.jpg),
    each stroke width in the selection will get two times wider than it was before.

    Typically, a cusp is a nonsmooth node (**[12.5.5 Node Types](ch12s05.html#one2dot5dot5_node_types
    "12.5.5 Node Types")**) where two path segments join, but you don’t even need
    to have a node to make a cusp; it is possible to create a sharp cusp in the middle
    of a Bézier curve (**[13.1.7 Spiro Spline](ch13s01.html#one3dot1dot7_spiro_spline

    possible join types, represented by the three toggle buttons, are **Miter join**

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this join, the outer outline of the stroke at the cusp point is continued
    by two straight line fragments, tangential to the stroke on both sides of the
    joint, until these straight lines cross. As a result, the joint is adorned by
    a sharp peak, called a *miter*, which becomes longer and sharper as the angle
    at the joint decreases, reaching far beyond the position of the cusp node.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This leads us to a problem, however. How long can the miter become? It is easy
    to see that when the angle at the joint becomes zero (which is perfectly legal),
    the miter should be infinitely long. This is obviously infeasible. To handle this
    situation, the **Miter limit** control allows you to set the maximum length of
    a miter in units of stroke width. For example, for the default miter limit of
    4, any miter shorter than 4 stroke widths remains sharp-tipped, but as soon as
    you decrease the angle to make the miter longer than that, it will be cut (beveled)
    at the distance of 4 stroke widths from the joint.

    set to 0\. This means that for any angle, the miter is cut off by a *bevel*—a
    straight line perpendicular to the bisector of the cusp angle.

    is similar to the **Bevel join**, but instead of a straight bevel, the miter is
    cut by a circular arc whose center is at the cusp point. This option is the most
    natural for largely curvilinear paths where occasional cusps might look out of
    character if not rounded.

    width compared to its length when using the default butt caps. For example, the
    1:1 pattern with round caps loses all its intervals; the round caps of adjacent
    dashes, each cap 0.5 stroke widths in length, now touch each other, as shown in

    Inkscape does not list such a pattern in the **Fill and Stroke** dialog; you will
    need to create it manually by first assigning a pattern with the interval length
    you need and then editing the `stroke-dasharray` property in the `style` attribute
    of the corresponding path element to set its dash length (first value) to 0\.
    Note, however, that without round or square caps, such a pattern will render the
    path completely invisible (which is the main reason it is not among the standard
    patterns—remember that the default caps setting is butt).

- en: Sometimes, you may want to evenly “fill” a path with mid markers, similar to
    the way the dash pattern is evenly repeated along the path. This is trivial for
    a simple straight line path, where you can add or remove as many mid nodes as
    necessary without changing the straight line shape. In a more complex path, however,
    some nodes may be necessary for the path to have the shape it already has, and
    you cannot move these nodes along the path without distorting that shape. On the
    other hand, you also cannot choose to not apply markers to these nodes; in SVG,
    mid markers apply to all mid nodes without exception. As a result, it may be impossible
    to distribute markers along a path perfectly evenly; however, the shorter your
    desired interval between markers and the simpler the path, the less noticeable
    this inevitable unevenness.

    "12.5.3 Deleting and Creating Nodes")**) by double-clicking or ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735556.png.jpg)-clicking
    anywhere on the path. For even distribution of nodes, however, another shortcut
    is more useful: ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735734.png.jpg) creates
    a new node in the middle of each segment between selected nodes and adds the new

    again adds two more nodes; another ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735734.png.jpg)
    adds four more nodes, and so on. In this simple case, all nodes will be distributed
    evenly at all times; however, if your path already had some mid nodes, selecting
    all nodes and hitting ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735734.png.jpg)
    repeatedly will add nodes more profusely in areas that had more nodes to begin
    with, as shown in [Figure 9-11](ch09s05.html#adding_mid_nodes_by_pressing_repeatedly

- en: Another approach to creating evenly distributed nodes is the **Add Nodes** extension
    (**[13.3 Path Extensions](ch13s03.html "13.3 Path Extensions")**). In it, you
    specify the maximum distance (in `px` units) between nodes along the path. In
    the result, the existing nodes may happen be closer to their neighbors than this
    distance, but no nodes cannot be farther apart; segments between nodes will be
    filled by new nodes equally spaced at the specified distance.

    nodes (those that were added only for the sake of mid markers and do not affect
    the shape of the path) is to use the **Simplify** command (**[12.3 Simplifying](ch12s03.html
    "12.3 Simplifying")**). Of course **Simplify** cannot really *know* which nodes
    are essential and which are not; it tries to guess it—and usually performs acceptably
    well, although undesired nodes and some shape distortion are impossible to avoid.

    all standard markers provided by Inkscape are either solid black or black with
    white filling. Unfortunately, even if you assign a different stroke color to a
    path with markers, this color will only apply to the stroke itself and won’t affect
    the markers. A red stroke with a black arrowhead is rarely what you had in mind.

    color. It can consist of any number of objects, grouped or not, with any paint,
    opacity, or even blur properties—in other words, anything Inkscape can draw can
    be a marker on a path. Applying such complex markers to paths with many added
    nodes (**[9.5.1 Mid Markers and Nodes](ch09s05.html#ninedot5dot1_mid_markers_and_nodes
    "9.5.1 Mid Markers and Nodes")**) can produce amazing compositions. To make use

    tab, and open the list of markers, you will see your new marker at the top, in

    the **Fill and Stroke** dialog to refresh the marker list.)

    oriented as they should be on a horizontal path that goes from left to right.
    For example, if you create a new arrowhead that you plan to use as an end marker,
    make it point horizontally to the right before converting it to a marker.

    as you change the stroke width. Its initial size (the size of the object that
    you have turned into a marker) corresponds to the 1 px stroke.

    to which that marker is attached. When you create a new marker, Inkscape uses
    the rotation center of the (first) selected object as that anchor point. By default,
    the rotation center is in the center of the object’s bounding box (**[4.2 The
    Bounding Box](ch04s02.html "4.2 The Bounding Box")**), which means the newly created
    marker will be centered around its node. If you move the rotation center, for
    example, to one of the corners of the object, the new marker will touch its node
    by that corner.

    with the intention to make it a marker again after editing)? Yes, although this
    involves destroying the path that the marker was applied to (so you may want to
    make a copy of the path first). This is done by choosing the command **Stroke
    to Path** from the **Path** menu. It turns the stroke into a filled path and,
    if the original path had markers, groups the converted path with objects that
    represent former markers. Just ungroup, choose one of the former markers, rotate
    it into the default orientation, and edit it as necessary.
