Most of the artistic effects possible with Photoshop are just as easy to do with GIMP and the reason is simple: at their roots, they both twiddle with pixels. Their menus and user interfaces differ, but the underlying processes are remarkably similar.</p><p>I often compare moving from Photoshop to GIMP to moving from one city to another. When you move to a new city, it takes time to find your way to the grocer or to the theater. But once you learn how to get there, the grocer and theater are probably much like the ones you left behind. So it is with GIMP. It takes patience to find the tools or filters that perform a given task, but the end result will be just as recognizable and familiar to you.</p><p>There’s no reason to think that, once you’ve learned your way around GIMP, you can’t create your own works of art. GIMP doesn’t have to be just a glorified icon editor or photo touchup tool. It is much more than that: it’s a tool to express yourself.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00451a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00451"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223482.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>I like working with stock images and distorting them repeatedly until I create my own little world.</em></span></p></div></div></div><p>Now, it’s true that art is a very personal thing. One man’s art is another man’s fish wrap. That doesn’t change the fact that you can still create art with GIMP that you’d happily frame and hang on your own walls. Your spouse, significant other, and/or roommates, on the other hand, might have different ideas.</p><p>That said, I want to show you with some advanced tutorials on how to be creative simply for the sake of being creative. The tutorials build on techniques learned in previous tutorials and bring together the foundations for doing your own artwork: initial design, integration of external images, coloring, and highlights and shading. Work with these to gradually expose your inner Van Gogh.</p><p>These tutorials will assume a more advanced understanding of GIMP’s tools, menus, dialogs and filters. But fear not . . . I won’t leave you completely hanging! So dive in and explore your creative side!</p><div class="sect1" title="6.1 Fire Girl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="sixdot1_fire_girl"/>6.1 Fire Girl</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1075" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1421" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1579" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1681" class="indexterm"/>This effect creates a ghostly figure wreathed in flame—a demon, an angel, a ghost, or an ifrit depending on your perspective. I simply call her the Fire Girl. The process for creating this effect can be reduced to these basic steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Isolate the girl from the background.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Edge-detect the girl on multiple layers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add and blend ornamental elements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Blend to remove excess details.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add flame and coloring.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add background emblem.</p></li></ol></div><p>Throughout the project, you’ll find that flames aren’t just components of the image but are also used for coloring. The easy way of using a flame to color a layer is to first desaturate the layer, and then add a flame layer above and set the flame layer mode to whatever “looks right.” However, if you place an image below a flame layer, the black region around the flame may block that lower layer from being visible, depending on the flame layer’s blend mode. To avoid this, you’ll use layer masks on flame layers or simply copy and paste flames, taking care to omit the black backgrounds from your source image.</p><p>Note that even if you follow this tutorial exactly, you won’t produce the same image. The steps allow for too many variations, especially when creating the crown of flames. Don’t be discouraged if your first attempt is less than ideal. I went through seven different designs before settling on this process. And the first four or five of those are, to be kind to myself, not something I’d ever show in public. I won’t even show them to my wife.</p><p>The tutorial’s process starts with a large canvas (2350 × 2033) to produce a print-ready design. To reduce memory and CPU requirements, you can scale the stock images down by 50 percent before starting.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00452a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00452"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223484.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Several stock images are used in this project, but the end result bears little resemblance to those originals.</em></span></p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Isolating the Girl from the Background"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="isolating_the_girl_from_the_background"/>Isolating the Girl from the Background</h2></div></div></div><p>The first step in this project is to isolate the girl from her background.

The best places to find these types of designs are on ornate picture frames and building architecture. This project got stuck with picture frames only because I couldn’t find any really good photos of Victorian architecture.</p><p>There are two ornamental pieces added to the design: one on the forehead and one around the neck.

This required shrinking the size of the frames. Had they been too small you could have scaled them up. This is seldom done because the scaled image quickly becomes pixelated. However, in this case the pixelation is hardly noticeable because of the weakly identifiable shapes (the ornate structure has no discernible objects—it’s just wavy lines). Additionally, using multiple copies of a frame layer and blending layer modes hides some of the pixelation, and, later, coloring with flames hides even more. The sheer size of this image also hides some of that pixelation when working onscreen. Large prints, however, would likely show the pixelation. Therefore, any prints for this size image when layers were scaled up would need to be no larger than the size of a magazine or book page.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00457a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00457"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223494.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Later you may find that colorizing with the flames leaves the ornamental layers rather bland.
