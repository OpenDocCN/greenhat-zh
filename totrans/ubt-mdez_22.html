Ubuntu suffers from its fair share of annoyances, and although I seem to spend far less time fixing things on Ubuntu than I ever used to on Windows, it’s best not to ignore the possibility that you might someday experience a hardware hiccup or sticky software situation.</p><p>The purpose of this chapter is to arm you with some general-purpose tips, tricks, and troubleshooting hints. You’ll find step-by-step instructions on how to fix several specific problems, but for the most part I’ve tried to keep the discussion general. This is because the way you resolve some issues will depend heavily on the peculiarities of your setup, and there just isn’t a bookshelf big enough for a guide that covers every possible eventuality in suitable detail. Fortunately, the Internet harbors a sizable collection of Ubuntu-related guides, so even if you don’t arrive at the exact answer you were looking for here, I hope you’ll be able to use some of my tips to help you find the right information on the Web.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0001"/></p><p>If you’ve run into a problem, flip through this chapter to see whether there’s anything that might help. I’ve covered problems with installation, booting, sound and video, Internet and network connections, hard disks and storage, and displays and graphics cards, along with pesky software issues such as programs freezing or slowing down your computer. If you’re not beset by any particular computer quandary, you might like to skim through this chapter to get some idea of what to do if misfortune does befall you in the future. Or, you could take my preferred route: Make yourself a hot beverage and head back to the games chapter (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Feathered Flippers">Chapter 17</a>) for some well-deserved R&amp;R.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0007"/></p><div class="sect1" title="I Can’t Get Ubuntu Installed"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="i_canat_get_ubuntu_installed"/>I Can’t Get Ubuntu Installed</h1></div></div></div><p>Not being able to install Ubuntu is a particularly unhappy problem because it means that you’ve probably been denied all the fun from the previous 21 chapters of this book! Never fear; there’s plenty you can do to convince Ubuntu to install itself on your computer, and if you’re still struggling, you can try alternative installation methods like booting from a USB stick, which I cover in <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Installing Ubuntu from a USB Flash Drive">Appendix A</a>.</p><div class="sect2" title="My Computer Won’t Boot from the CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="my_computer_wonat_boot_from_the_cd"/>My Computer Won’t Boot from the CD</h2></div></div></div><p>If you tried to start your computer from the Ubuntu installation CD but never even got to the purple boot screen (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#going_for_a_dip" title="Going for a Dip">Going for a Dip</a>) or if the computer just boots into Windows every time, try one of the following options:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Check the boot order</strong></span>.</span></dt><dd><p>When your computer starts up (<span class="emphasis"><em>boots</em></span>), it goes through a list of devices in a set order, checking to see whether they have an operating system on them. As soon as it finds an operating system, the computer will boot from that device, and it won’t check any of the other devices. This means that if the hard disk comes before the CD drive in the boot order, the computer will boot from the hard disk rather than the CD drive. To boot from the CD, you need to make sure that the CD drive comes first in the boot order.

It’s possible to check whether a disc has faults on it by doing a checksum test. A checksum is sort of like a fingerprint; you take the checksum of your Ubuntu CD and compare it with the checksum of an Ubuntu CD that is known to be free of faults. If there is but one tiny difference between the two discs, the checksums will be different too—the “fingerprints” won’t match. Ubuntu uses the MD5SUM program to do its checksums. Go to <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/</a> and scroll down to the “MD5SUM on Windows” section to see how you can find the checksum of your disc. If it turns out that the checksums don’t match, you’ll need to get another CD (for example, by downloading a CD image from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/</a> or by contacting No Starch Press to ask for a replacement).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0014"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Make sure you burned the disc correctly</strong></span>.</span></dt><dd><p>If you downloaded a disc image (<span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span>) file instead of using the CD that came with this book, make sure that you burned the CD correctly. A common mistake that people make is to just copy the <span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span> file onto a disc, as if it were a normal file. This won’t work; you need to use the Burn Disc Image option (or something similar) in your CD-burning software to do it properly.

To get around this particular annoyance, you might need to start the computer from a live CD (like the one included with this book) or use some special options to help the process along.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0017"/></p><p>This section covers the two most common classes of boot problems, GRUB errors and kernel problems. There’s some general advice for other types of boot problems too, including tips for dual-booters struggling to get Windows to start.</p><div class="sect2" title="I Get a GRUB Error"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i_get_a_grub_error"/>I Get a GRUB Error</h2></div></div></div><p>When you try to start your computer, you might be left with a black screen, which means that there was a <span class="emphasis"><em>GRUB error</em></span>. This means there is a problem with the GRUB bootloader, which is responsible for telling your computer’s hardware how to start Ubuntu. Fixing these errors tends to involve typing a few cryptic-looking commands or booting off a live CD, so be prepared for that. You can find a short guide to handling common GRUB errors at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#GRUB_Errors">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#GRUB_Errors</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0020"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="I Get a Kernel Panic or the Computer Freezes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i_get_a_kernel_panic_or_the_computer_fre"/>I Get a Kernel Panic or the Computer Freezes</h2></div></div></div><p>Kernel panics have a scary name for a reason. If you get an error message saying that there was a <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel panic</em></span>, something pretty serious went wrong in Linux-land, and you’ll probably find that you can’t use the computer until you fix the problem. Fortunately, such errors are rare, and even if you do get one, you should be able to fix it without too much work. I should also note that kernel panics are only serious in that they make it difficult to run software on the computer—the physical hardware side of your computer won’t be damaged at all, so once you get the software working again, everything will be back to normal. So really, there’s no need to panic at all.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0022"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0023"/></p><p>Freezes and kernel panics often go hand in hand, but they’re not necessarily the same thing. You’ve probably seen a computer freeze up before—moving the mouse or pressing keys on the keyboard does nothing, and the display stays frozen. If the computer freezes, all you can do is give it a minute or two to see whether it wakes up and, if not, restart the computer or turn it off by holding down the power button for a few seconds.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0024"/></p><p>You can try a few things if you keep getting kernel panics or freezes, detailed in the following sections. If nothing seems to be working, ask for advice in the Ubuntu forums, and, with a bit of luck, you’ll soon be up and running again.</p><div class="sect3" title="Unplug Unnecessary Hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="unplug_unnecessary_hardware"/>Unplug Unnecessary Hardware</h3></div></div></div><p>A lot of freezes are caused by problems with hardware devices. If you recently bought some new hardware, try unplugging it and see whether you still get the freezes. If you recently installed some system updates, the driver for some hardware could be causing the problem too. It’s worth unplugging any unnecessary hardware (such as scanners, printers, external hard drives, and the like) to check whether they’re causing the problems.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Disable Restricted Drivers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="disable_restricted_drivers"/>Disable Restricted Drivers</h3></div></div></div><p>Some freezes are caused by problems with accelerated graphics drivers (see <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#games_solidus_unity_donat_work_colon_ins" title="Games/Unity Don’t Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers">Games/Unity Don’t Work: Installing Accelerated Graphics Drivers</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#problems_with_the_display_and_graphics" title="Problems with the Display and Graphics Cards">Problems with the Display and Graphics Cards</a>) or restricted drivers for other hardware (see <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#installing_drivers_for_your_network_soli" title="Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card">Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#installing_drivers_for_your_network_soli" title="Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card">Installing Drivers for Your Network/Wireless Card</a>).

It’s sort of like a stress test for your RAM. Let it run until the Pass percentage at the top right of the screen has gone past 100 percent once or twice—this might take as long as an hour or two, depending on how much system memory you have. By that time, Memtest86 should have found any faults in the system memory and reported them on the screen. If it does find a problem, you might need to get some of your RAM replaced, because it could be damaged. (If that’s the case, it might be time to call in your friendly neighborhood IT technician to take a look at things.)</p><p>You can turn off your computer at any time while Memtest86 is running—you don’t need to shut it down properly as you usually would.</p><div class="figure"><a id="checking_for_memory_faults_with_memtest8"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject22_d1e23072"/><img alt="Checking for memory faults with Memtest86" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264074.png"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-4. Checking for memory faults with Memtest86</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Use an Older Kernel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="use_an_older_kernel"/>Use an Older Kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>Some freezes occur because of problems with kernel updates or drivers.

Assuming it’s the latter, you’ll find that most sound-related problems in Ubuntu are caused by using incorrect sound card settings. Unfortunately, the number of these settings tends to be overwhelming, and it’s rarely obvious which ones you should change to get things working.

Open a Terminal using the Dash, type <strong class="userinput"><code>aplay -l</code></strong> into it, and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.

A codec is a small piece of software that adds support for a given audio/video format into a program. Rhythmbox and the Totem Movie Player normally find the right codec for you (for example, see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#installing_mp3_support_for_audio_apps" title="Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps">Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#installing_mp3_support_for_audio_apps" title="Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps">Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps</a>). However, if they fail, try installing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu restricted extras</em></span> package—this package contains a lot of extra codecs. Once the package is installed, close and reopen your audio/video file and see whether it plays.

See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a> for more on starting from the live CD and <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Penguins at the Gates">Chapter 19</a> for some tips on how to mount hard-disk partitions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="I Can’t Delete a File"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i_canat_delete_a_file"/>I Can’t Delete a File</h2></div></div></div><p>The usual reason for not being able to delete a file is that you don’t have the right permissions to delete it (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. A Tidy Nest">Chapter 7</a> for an explanation of file permissions). Right-click a blank area of the folder in which the file is stored, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Permissions</strong></span> tab. If you are listed as the owner, make sure that your Folder Access permissions are set to Create and delete files. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span> and then try to delete the file again.</p><p>If you are not the owner of the folder, you’ll have to gain ownership of it before you can delete the file. This is where you need to ask yourself, “Should I really be deleting someone else’s file?” Sometimes file permissions get messed up, and so the file might be yours—in that case, it’s okay to delete it. If it’s someone else’s file, though, ask for his permission first.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0117"/></p><p>If you’re convinced that deleting the file is a good idea, open a Terminal and use the <strong class="userinput"><code>chown</code></strong> command to change the owner of the folder. Here’s how it works: If I wanted to delete a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>cats.jpg</em></span> from the Pets folder in the Shared folder, I would type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo chown phil ˜/Shared/Pets</code></strong>, followed by the enter key (remember, <code class="literal">˜</code> means “my Home folder”). After typing my password and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span> again, I would become the owner of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pets</em></span> folder and could delete <span class="emphasis"><em>cats.jpg</em></span> as normal. Of course, you should substitute the name of the folder and your username in place of mine for this to work for you.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Don’t use this method to delete system files (in other words, files that aren’t stored in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/home</em></span> folder) unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing. There’s a good reason why you don’t have permission to delete system files by default; you could really screw up your system if you remove something vital.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Software Installation Problems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="software_installation_problems"/>Software Installation Problems</h1></div></div></div><p>Ubuntu’s software management tools tend to operate pretty smoothly these days.

This is because APT is updating its list of software sources in the background but, infuriatingly, doesn’t let you know when it has finished. If you’ve been waiting for a while and have already tried closing and then reopening the Software Center (as suggested in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a>) to no effect, then it might be time to break out the big guns and <span class="emphasis"><em>force</em></span> the Software Center to take notice of the new repository.</p><p>To do this, first close the Ubuntu Software Center.

For example, if the repository no longer exists, you would have seen an error message starting with W: <code class="literal">Failed to fetch</code>.

Instead, in this section I’ve chosen to provide some general advice on how to deal with misbehaving programs, plus I’ve given you a sneaky little section on a common Firefox problem. If you need to handle something specific, it’s never a bad idea to try looking at the help files for a given program. Selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Contents</strong></span> should get you to a manual for most software. Failing that, a Google search often does the trick for me.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0128"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0129"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0130"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0131"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Firefox Says It’s Already Running"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="firefox_says_itas_already_running"/>Firefox Says It’s Already Running</h2></div></div></div><p>When you exit Firefox, it sometimes takes a while to close itself down properly—the window will disappear, but Firefox could still be running somewhere in the murky depths of your computer. When you try to open Firefox again, you may receive a message that Firefox is running in the background so you can’t open a new window. This is no good because you want a Firefox window that you can see! If this happens, open a Terminal, type <strong class="userinput"><code>killall firefox</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. (The command is case sensitive, so be sure you’re typing in all lowercase.) This will force Firefox to shut down immediately. With that done, try to open Firefox again, and the window should pop up as normal. If it still isn’t working, try following the advice at <a class="ulink" href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Firefox%20is%20already%20running%20but%20is%20not%20responding/">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Firefox%20is%20already%20running%20but%20is%20not%20responding/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="A Program Always Crashes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a_program_always_crashes"/>A Program Always Crashes</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have a program that keeps crashing, try running it in a Terminal to see what’s going wrong.

Once you have the command, type it into the Terminal and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The program should run as normal, so keep using it until it crashes. When it does, look at the Terminal to see whether it left any clues as to what’s going wrong in there. Error messages in the Terminal can be cryptic, so you might want to ask someone on the forums or IRC (both of which are discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. A Colony of Penguins">Chapter 21</a>) if she knows what it means.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0132"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0133"/></p><p>If the messages in the Terminal are no help, you should report a bug.

Burning a CD, installing software, and converting music files to a different format all tend to strain your system, so you shouldn’t be surprised if things feel a little sluggish when something like that is running. But what if your computer is running slowly even if you’re not doing anything intensive? You can investigate the cause of the slowdown by opening the System Monitor with the Dash. Select the Resources tab and check your CPU (processor) usage—if it’s around 100 percent, then a program running in the background is probably responsible for the problem (for example, the one in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#the_system_monitor_comma_showing_the_gwi" title="Figure 22-14. The System Monitor, showing the Gwibber service program using an unhealthy 94 percent of the processor for a long period of time">Figure 22-14</a>). Choose the Processes tab and click the % CPU column heading once or until it has a down arrow next to it. This will sort the list of programs in order of how much of the processor they are using. The one that’s using all of the CPU should appear at the top of the list.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0134"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0135"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0136"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_system_monitor_comma_showing_the_gwi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject22_d1e24875"/><img alt="The System Monitor, showing the Gwibber service program using an unhealthy 94 percent of the processor for a long period of time" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264094.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-14. The System Monitor, showing the Gwibber service program using an unhealthy 94 percent of the processor for a long period of time</p></div><p>It’s normally best to wait a few minutes and see whether the program reduces its CPU usage by itself. After all, maybe some system software is running a scan or dealing with some other maintenance operation. If the CPU usage stays high, the program might have gotten stuck, so select it and click <span class="strong"><strong>End Process</strong></span> to force it to close. Your system should return to its usual speed within a few seconds.</p><p>If you didn’t notice high CPU usage on the Resources tab, then it’s possible that something is overusing your hard disk instead. Programs that do this almost always finish what they’re doing within 5 or 10 minutes, so you should probably ride it out. If the sluggishness persists, the easiest way to fix the problem is to restart the computer.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0137"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0138"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-22-0139"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Lost Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="lost_files"/>Lost Files</h1></div></div></div><p>Losing an important file is one of those uniquely frustrating experiences in life.

Install the Desktop Search application from the Software Center. Once installed, Tracker will start building its search index. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes, so you might want to wander off and do something else for a while. When you come back to the computer, open the Desktop Search app from the Dash and search for your lost file there. (Note that you may want to play with the Tracker search settings to make sure that all of the relevant locations are being searched. You can do this using the Search and Indexing tool, which you can open from the Dash.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Look in the Trash</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>It’s possible that you accidentally deleted the file. Click the Trash icon on the Launcher and look for it in there.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Another explanation for the lost file might be that it was saved in a temporary folder. This happens when you open an email attachment, for example—the file is put in a temporary folder by your email client and then opened using the default application for that type of file. Unfortunately, some programs don’t realize that the file is temporary, and they let you save it in the temporary directory . . . which is periodically wiped clean. If you suspect that this may have happened and you have restarted your computer since you last saved the file, then it’s probably gone forever.</p><p>If you haven’t restarted, there may still be hope; try opening the (unmodified, original) file again to see which folder it gets stored in by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span> (or similar) in the program you’re using. Then check which folder the Save window opens up to. For example, the Thunderbird mail client temporarily stores attachments that you open in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/tmp</em></span> folder (see <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#looking_for_a_file_that_was_saved_in_a_t" title="Figure 22-15. Looking for a file that was saved in a temporary folder by Thunderbird">Figure 22-15</a> for an example). Note the name of the folder and open your Home folder in Nautilus. Then, select <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span>, type the name of the temporary folder in the box that appears, and try to find your file in the folder that opens.
