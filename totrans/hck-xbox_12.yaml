    On one hand, innovation deserves its just reward. The right of inventors or authors
    to exclusively produce or sell the fruits of their labor must be protected. On
    the other hand, a free and competitive marketplace is also required to preserve
    innovation and to ensure fair markets. The study of the design principles embodied
    in existing products and the ability to produce improved derivative products are
    an important part of a competitive market place.

    incentives to create if others can freely use their work. But that protection
    is limited in order to assure that the public ultimately benefits.⁷ For example,

    (BNA) 286 (Del. Ch. 1984) (holding that a consultant to a hospital used improper
    means to obtain trade secret interface information by wiretapping the hospital’s
    licensed software system to study the manner in which the server software exchanged
    data with the client software because this use had not been authorized by the
    hospital; stating further that even if the use had been authorized, the action
    would have breached restrictive terms in the license); see also *DSC* *Communications
    Corp. v. Pulse Communications, Inc.* , 170 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding
    that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether Pulsecom’s use of a “snooper
    board” at a telephone company to get access to interface information about DSC’s
    software resulted in a misappropriation of a trade secret in view of restrictions
    in the telephone company’s license to use DSC’s software).
