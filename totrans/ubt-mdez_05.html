The good news is that Linux can match anything that your previous operating system could do online, and in many cases it can do it faster or more easily. Ubuntu was born on the Web, so it should be no surprise that it comes with a very healthy suite of Internet-ready applications right out of the box.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0002"/></p><p>In this chapter, you’ll take a tour of Ubuntu’s Internet software so you can get a feel for what this Linux stuff is capable of. You’ll begin with old stalwarts like the web browser and email client, briefly tour instant messaging, and then head off in the more modish direction of Twitter and microblogging.</p><div class="sect1" title="Firefox: Your Internet Browser"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="firefox_colon_your_internet_browser"/>Firefox: Your Internet Browser</h1></div></div></div><p>The default web browser in your Ubuntu system is Firefox, which is enjoying increasing popularity in not only the Linux world but also the Windows and Mac worlds. Chances are you are already a Firefox user, but if you’re not, no worries. Things work more or less the same in all browsers, so you should be able to use Firefox’s basic features without any instruction. Of course, some of its features do distinguish Firefox from its competition, so I will mention those.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0005"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="controlling_browser_window_clutter_with"/>Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs</h2></div></div></div><p>Usually when you click a link on a web page, the new page opens in the same window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a new, separate window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a new window by right-clicking the link and then selecting the Open Link in New Window option. This can be very useful; however, once you have more than a few browser windows open, it gets sort of hard to find what you’re looking for. It can also slow things down a bit.</p><p>This is where Firefox’s tab feature comes in handy (so handy, in fact, that almost every other browser out there has copied it). To see how it works, try it yourself right here and now. Open your Firefox browser by clicking its icon in the Launcher (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_firefox_icon_in_the_launcher" title="Figure 5-1. The Firefox icon in the Launcher">Figure 5-1</a>) or by searching for Firefox in the Dash.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0007"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_firefox_icon_in_the_launcher"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3580"/><img alt="The Firefox icon in the Launcher" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263502.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-1. The Firefox icon in the Launcher</p></div><p>Then, search for the word <span class="emphasis"><em>nyckelharpa</em></span> using Firefox’s handy search box, which is at the top-right corner of the browser window (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#performing_a_google_search_from_the_fire" title="Figure 5-2. Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box">Figure 5-2</a>). By default, Firefox will perform searches for keywords entered in the search box using Google. You can, if you like, select other search engines or search particular websites by clicking the colored <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> icon in the search box and then making your selection. Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! are available, to name a few, and you can even add others. For now, however, let’s stick to Google by typing nyckelharpa in that search box. Once you’ve finished typing, press enter. A page of search results should appear in the main pane of the Firefox window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0008"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="performing_a_google_search_from_the_fire"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3601"/><img alt="Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263504.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-2. Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box</p></div><p>One of the top results should be the American Nyckelharpa Association, and you are now going to open that page in a new tab, rather than in the same or a new window. To do that, right-click the link and, in the pop-up menu that appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Open Link in New Tab</strong></span>. You can, if you prefer, make things a tad easier and dispense with the pop-up menu selection step by simply clicking the link with the middle mouse button (or with both mouse buttons simultaneously) or by holding down the <span class="keycap">ctrl</span> key as you click the link. Either way, the new page will appear in a new tab (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#a_link_opened_in_a_new_tab_in_firefox" title="Figure 5-3. A link opened in a new tab in Firefox">Figure 5-3</a>), while your original page of search results remains, ready and waiting, in the other tab. I am pretty confident in saying that, once you get used to this feature, you will wonder how you ever got along without it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0010"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_link_opened_in_a_new_tab_in_firefox"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3627"/><img alt="A link opened in a new tab in Firefox" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263506.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-3. A link opened in a new tab in Firefox</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Save It for Later: Using History and Bookmarks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="save_it_for_later_colon_using_history_an"/>Save It for Later: Using History and Bookmarks</h2></div></div></div><p>Chances are, you have a few favorite websites that you return to again and again, perhaps even checking some of them a few times a day. Typing the entire web address every time you want to check Facebook can get tedious, and putting the same search terms into Google five times a day feels clunky too. Surely there’s a better way? In fact, Firefox is crammed with better ways! Let’s take a look at some of them.</p><div class="sect3" title="Bookmarks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="bookmarks"/>Bookmarks</h3></div></div></div><p>First up is Firefox’s Bookmarks feature. To save a web page for perusal at your convenience, all you need to do is click the empty star icon in the right-hand corner of the address bar. When you do that, the star will turn yellow, indicating that the page has been saved. But saved where, you ask? Go to the Bookmarks menu and look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Recently Bookmarked</strong></span> menu item. A list will expand that contains your most recent bookmarks, including the one you just added. All it takes to revisit the page is to click the appropriate item in that menu.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0011"/></p><p>There are other ways of getting at your bookmarks besides the Bookmarks menu, some of which you may find more convenient. One is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bookmarks sidebar</em></span> : Click <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> to bring it up (or press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-B if you’re more keyboard shortcut inclined). A new pane will appear down the left-hand side of the window with an expandable list of bookmarks, as well as a search box (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_bookmarks_sidebar_in_firefox" title="Figure 5-4. The Bookmarks sidebar in Firefox">Figure 5-4</a>). Click through the lists or start typing in the search box to find the web page you’re after. When you’re finished, you can hide the sidebar by clicking the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> in its top right-hand corner or by deselecting it in the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> menu.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_bookmarks_sidebar_in_firefox"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3680"/><img alt="The Bookmarks sidebar in Firefox" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263508.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-4. The Bookmarks sidebar in Firefox</p></div><p>Another nifty way of accessing bookmarks is through the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bookmarks toolbar</em></span>. By default, this is hidden away so you can’t use it. To wake the toolbar from its slumber, click <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Toolbars</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks Toolbar</strong></span>. A new strip will appear immediately below the address bar, containing only two links (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_bookmarks_toolbar" title="Figure 5-5. The Bookmarks toolbar">Figure 5-5</a>). One of these, Most Visited, contains a list of the websites that you visit most frequently. Simply click <span class="strong"><strong>Most Visited</strong></span>, choose one of the sites from the list that pops up, and you’ll be taken directly to one of your favorite sites. The second item is a link to some instructions on “Getting Started,” which you may wish to peruse later. For now, let’s concentrate on populating the Bookmarks toolbar with regular bookmarks.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_bookmarks_toolbar"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3708"/><img alt="The Bookmarks toolbar" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263510.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-5. The Bookmarks toolbar</p></div><p>Adding bookmarks to the toolbar is quite straightforward. When you first bookmark a page by clicking the star in the address bar, click the (now yellow) star again. An <span class="emphasis"><em>Edit This Bookmark</em></span> box will appear, like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#editing_a_bookmark" title="Figure 5-6. Editing a bookmark">Figure 5-6</a>, giving you a number of options. To save the page in the Bookmarks toolbar, simply change the <span class="emphasis"><em>Folder</em></span> option appropriately and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span>. A new bookmark will appear on the toolbar, which you can access with a single click.</p><p>If you’re a particularly intrepid web adventurer, you might soon find that you have an unwieldy number of bookmarks building up. Rather than curtailing your adventures, you might try a bit of spring-cleaning instead. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Show All Bookmarks</strong></span>, and a Library window will open up. From this window, you can organize all of your bookmarks, renaming, deleting, and filing them away as you see fit. To see how this works, select <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks Menu</strong></span> from the list on the left-hand side of the window and click <span class="strong"><strong>Organize</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>New Folder</strong></span>. A new folder will appear, which you can rename as you like. With that done, try dragging some of the bookmarks into the folder. Repeat this procedure a few times, and you’ll soon have your bookmark collection neatly categorized.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0012"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="editing_a_bookmark"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3752"/><img alt="Editing a bookmark" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263512.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-6. Editing a bookmark</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="history"/>History</h3></div></div></div><p>The problem with bookmarks is that you have to remember to bookmark a page in the first place. That’s all well and good if a website strikes you as worth keeping for later when you first visit it, but what if you found something a few days ago that seems important only in retrospect? For just such eventualities, Firefox keeps a detailed history of all of the websites you’ve visited over the last few months, or even longer. To view your web-browsing history, click <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span> or press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-H. This will bring up the <span class="emphasis"><em>History sidebar</em></span>, which has a full list of websites you’ve visited, sorted by date. You can browse or search through these, just as you could with the Bookmarks toolbar. Clicking any of the pages in the list will bring it up in the main Firefox window again.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0013"/></p><p>To find a page, it’s also possible to sort the list by something other than date. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> button immediately to the right of the search box in the History sidebar and select one of the options from the menu that pops up to re-sort the list. For example, to view your browsing history grouped by website, rather than by date visited, select <span class="strong"><strong>By Site</strong></span>.</p><p>Of course, trawling through your entire web history every time you want to find a previously viewed website isn’t everyone’s idea of fun. To this end, Firefox has what I think you’ll agree is a rather awesome feature: the Awesome Bar. This is actually just another name for the address bar, which might leave you with the impression that there’s perhaps more to the dull old text box than meets the eye. Indeed, there is: Open a new tab and start typing. As the letters appear in the address bar, a list will appear immediately below it, containing links to websites that you’ve previously visited (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_awesome_bar_comma_showing_items_from" title="Figure 5-7. The Awesome Bar, showing items from the web-browsing history">Figure 5-7</a>). Firefox is directly searching your web history as you type, finding anything that matches what you’ve entered in the address bar. Refine the search by typing a few more letters or scroll down through the list until you find the website you’re looking for. With a single click, the page will load, negating any need to type its address out in full. Slick, no? You can also use the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard to select items from the list and use the <span class="keycap">enter</span> key to visit the page that is currently highlighted—no clicking required.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0014"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_awesome_bar_comma_showing_items_from"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3806"/><img alt="The Awesome Bar, showing items from the web-browsing history" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263514.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-7. The Awesome Bar, showing items from the web-browsing history</p></div><p>As well as web addresses, you can also type search terms into the address bar. For example, type <strong class="userinput"><code>cat pictures</code></strong> into the address bar and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Firefox recognizes that <span class="emphasis"><em>cat pictures</em></span> wasn’t meant to be a web address and will perform a search instead, just as if you had typed those words into the search box to the right. While it might take a little time to get used to how the Awesome Bar works, it’s a pretty nifty feature that can save you a lot of clicking around.</p><p>When I said that Firefox remembers everything you’ve looked at recently, I really did mean everything. If you don’t want Firefox to remember the pages you visit, at least for a time, then you can try <span class="emphasis"><em>Private Browsing mode</em></span>. This is handy if you want to look at something confidential, such as a banking website. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Start Private Browsing</strong></span> and start surfing—Firefox will instantly forget any and all of the pages that you visit while private browsing is enabled, and they won’t appear in your web history or otherwise. When you want to return Firefox to its normal operation, simply go back to the Tools menu and click <span class="strong"><strong>Stop Private Browsing</strong></span>. The window will return to whatever state it was in before you started private browsing, without any trace to be seen of the websites you just visited.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0015"/></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keeping_up-to-date_with_live_bookmarks"/>Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks</h2></div></div></div><p>The Web is awash in all sorts of news and information, and it can be hard to keep tabs on it all. Personally, I hate missing my daily dose of offbeat stories from Boing Boing, the aptly subtitled “directory of wonderful things” (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.boingboing.net/">http://www.boingboing.net/</a>). Fortunately, Firefox has a neat way of dealing with your information overload called <span class="emphasis"><em>live bookmarks</em></span> (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>RSS feeds</em></span>). These provide you with an automatically updated list of articles from any website that supports them (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#a_live_bookmark_in_action" title="Figure 5-8. A live bookmark in action">Figure 5-8</a>).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0020"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_live_bookmark_in_action"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3879"/><img alt="A live bookmark in action" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263516.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-8. A live bookmark in action</p></div><p>You can check whether a website has an RSS feed by going to the Bookmarks menu and checking whether the <span class="emphasis"><em>Subscribe to This Page</em></span> menu item is enabled. If it’s grayed out, then bad luck—there’s no RSS feed. If it’s white, not gray, then you’re in business! Let’s use Boing Boing as an example: Load <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boingboing.net/">http://www.boingboing.net/</a> in Firefox and go to the Bookmarks menu. The Subscribe to This Page item will be white, which means it’s clickable. Click it, and you’ll get a list of the most recent articles along with an invitation to subscribe to the feed in the box at the top of the page. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Subscribe Now</strong></span>, and in the window that appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Subscribe</strong></span> to add the live bookmark to the same toolbar as the Latest Headlines link.</p><p>Some websites provide links to their RSS feeds rather than showing them in the address bar. If you find one of these links (it’s normally called <span class="emphasis"><em>ATOM</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>RSS/XML</em></span>), click it, and you should be taken to a list of articles with a box at the top, as in the previous example. From there, the steps for adding the feed to your bookmarks are the same.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0021"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pop-up Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pop-up_manager"/>Pop-up Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>Firefox has a number of other useful features. One is its Pop-up Manager, which suppresses those annoying pop-up windows that too often appear when you access a new web page. You can enable or disable this feature from the Preferences window (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>); click the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> icon in the top pane of that window and then check or uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Block pop-up windows</strong></span> box. You can also permit certain sites to provide pop-up windows (some pop-ups are not only useful but also necessary for the correct functioning of a site) by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Exceptions</strong></span> button to the right of that Block pop-up windows entry and inputting the web address for the site in question.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0022"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0025"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Multimedia Plug-ins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="multimedia_plug-ins"/>Multimedia Plug-ins</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the coolest things about Firefox is that it allows you to expand its functionality by adding various extensions. The most commonly used extensions come in the form of <span class="emphasis"><em>plug-ins</em></span>. These allow web pages to do much more than just display text and pictures—you’ll often need a plug-in to watch videos or play games online, for example. Three plug-ins are used far more widely than any others, so I’ll concentrate here on those.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0027"/></p><div class="sect3" title="Flash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="flash"/>Flash</h3></div></div></div><p>The most frequently used browser plug-in for any system is Adobe’s Flash Player. Flash provides websites with all sorts of exciting multimedia effects and capabilities, and as a result, it is used by a rather large number of sites. In fact, chances are you’ve probably seen numerous Flash-enhanced pages without even being aware of it. For example, if you’ve ever watched a video on YouTube, you’ve enjoyed the wonders of Flash.</p><p>How do you get the Flash Player plug-in? Well, if you opted to install third-party software when you first installed your system, you already have it.

It is very straightforward to use, and it includes most of the most important email functions you’ve come to expect, such as junk mail filters. In fact, it’s somewhat similar to Windows Mail in terms of appearance and handling. The fact that Thunderbird is also available in both Mac and Windows versions means that you may already be familiar with it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0043"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0044"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_thunderbird_email_client"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4269"/><img alt="The Thunderbird email client" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263532.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-16. The Thunderbird email client</p></div><p>To open Thunderbird, bring up the Dash and search for it. When it starts up, you’ll see a blue bird icon appear in the Launcher. If you’d like to keep it there so you have easy access to your email, right-click the icon and choose Lock to Launcher from the menu that pops up.</p><p>When Thunderbird starts for the first time, you’ll be greeted with a Mail Account Setup window, which asks for a few basic details about your email account. Enter your name, your email address, and the password for your email account and click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> to proceed. Now, exactly what happens when you enter your information in this window will be quite specific to your individual circumstances. If you have an email account with one of the big email providers, like Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo!, Thunderbird will automatically set up your email account with the minimum of fuss, updating the Mail Account Setup screen with only a couple of additional questions. If you use a lesser-known provider, such as your workplace’s Exchange email server, however, you’ll have to enter a few more details to get things up and running. Fortunately, Thunderbird is one of the most popular email applications out there, so most email providers will have detailed instructions on how to get it working posted somewhere on their website.</p><p>Once you’ve entered the details demanded of you, or followed the instructions of your email service provider, click <span class="strong"><strong>Create Account</strong></span>. Thunderbird will start updating, checking your email account for new messages, and so forth. You’ll notice that a few email-related folders appear in the bar on the left side of the screen, such as an Inbox and Sent Mail and Drafts folders. From here on, it’s pretty much business as usual; you can do the same things that you’d do with any other email client. From the toolbar at the top of the Thunderbird window, you can click <span class="strong"><strong>Get Mail</strong></span> to retrieve any unread messages from your email provider or click <span class="strong"><strong>Write</strong></span> to start composing a new message. There’s also an Address Book for managing your contacts and a handy search feature that you can use to find messages. As I mentioned, Thunderbird has a lot of other features; going into them all here would be somewhat time-consuming, so I’ll leave it to you to explore for yourself. You might like to check out Thunderbird’s excellent help and support website, which can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://support.mozillamessaging.com/">http://support.mozillamessaging.com/</a>. In addition to troubleshooting advice, it has a number of guides to help you get started and information about everything that Thunderbird is capable of.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Messaging Menu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_messaging_menu"/>The Messaging Menu</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we move on to look at some of the other Internet apps that come with Ubuntu, it’s worth showing off a cute little feature that ties together a number of communication-related apps into one neat interface. See the envelope icon toward the right end of the panel at the top of the screen? This is the Messaging Menu (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_messaging_menu_comma_accessed_by_cli" title="Figure 5-17. The Messaging Menu, accessed by clicking the envelope icon">Figure 5-17</a>). Click it, and you’ll find entries for email, chat, and “broadcast,” which refers to social media and microblogging services like Twitter and Facebook. You can use the Messaging Menu to do all sorts of things—compose a new email, start a chat, update your Twitter status. In short, use it for anything to do with communicating with the outside world. You’ll find out more about the chat and broadcast options shortly, but for now, let’s take a look at how the Messaging Menu handles email.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0045"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_messaging_menu_comma_accessed_by_cli"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4307"/><img alt="The Messaging Menu, accessed by clicking the envelope icon" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263534.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-17. The Messaging Menu, accessed by clicking the envelope icon</p></div><p>If Thunderbird is closed, you can start it up by opening the Messaging Menu and clicking Mail. As long as Thunderbird is running, the Messaging Menu will keep tabs on the current state of your email account. When you receive a new email, the envelope icon on the top panel will change color from white to blue. When this happens, click the envelope to display the Messaging Menu, and you’ll find a summary of how many new emails you have at the bottom of the menu. This is especially handy if you have multiple email accounts; a breakdown of how many new emails you have in each account will be shown, and clicking the menu item for an account will bring up the new emails in Thunderbird. The Messaging Menu also has shortcuts so that you can quickly access your list of contacts or compose a new email. All in all, very convenient, as I’m sure you’ll agree.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Chatting with Your Friends via Empathy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="chatting_with_your_friends_via_empathy"/>Chatting with Your Friends via Empathy</h1></div></div></div><p>Email is an extremely useful tool, but there’s often quite a delay between sending a message and getting a response. What if you just fancy a quick chat? That’s where <span class="emphasis"><em>instant messaging (IM)</em></span> comes in. If you’re not familiar with the concept, all you do is find your friend on an IM network and type a short message to him. Your message will show up on his screen in the blink of an eye. He can then reply to it, and you receive the reply just as quickly. So it continues, until you say goodbye and disconnect from the network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0046"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0047"/></p><p>There are lots of different IM networks out there, such as AIM, Google Chat, MSN/Windows Live, and Yahoo! Messenger. You can usually talk only to those people who are using the same network as you, and you’ll need an <span class="emphasis"><em>IM client</em></span> application to connect to any of them. Ubuntu comes preinstalled with a fully featured IM client called Empathy, which has the ability to connect to multiple networks at once.</p><div class="sect2" title="Starting a Chat"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="starting_a_chat"/>Starting a Chat</h2></div></div></div><p>For this section, I’m going to assume that you already have a user account on an instant messaging network.

If Empathy is not successful in making a connection, it will tell you so by displaying a message in a colored bar at the top of the window.

To bring it up again, open the Messaging Menu and click <span class="strong"><strong>Chat</strong></span>. The Contact List will reappear, and you can start a new chat by double-clicking a contact’s name, as before. This is also how to open up Empathy when you first log in to Ubuntu. Unlike some chat applications, Empathy does not start automatically when you log in, so you need to start it manually by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Chat</strong></span> from the Messaging Menu.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0053"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0056"/></p><p>I’ve only scratched the surface here.

Explaining all of this would probably take a whole chapter on its own, so instead I’m going to point you toward Empathy’s user guide, which should give you the lowdown on what else you can do and how you can do it. In any Empathy window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Contents</strong></span>, wait a few seconds for the help window to pop up, and then look through the list of topics until you find something relevant.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0057"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Telling People When You Don’t Want to Chat"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="telling_people_when_you_donat_want_to_ch"/>Telling People When You Don’t Want to Chat</h2></div></div></div><p>Chatting is great, but very few people have the stamina (or the spare time) to do it all day long.

Your current chat status will be marked out by a small white circle at the top of the menu. If you’re connected to an IM network, the circle will be next to the green Available status, which means that other people can tell that you’re online.

There are millions upon millions of blogs out there covering all sorts of subjects, from astronomy to economics to fluffy kittens. The quality of content varies wildly, but for the most part, blog entries are typical newspaper-opinion-column types of pieces. So, what if you had a blog where you were forced to write everything you wanted to say in less than 140 characters?

I recently followed a Twitter conversation among a few of my friends who were watching a live football game. They sent messages every time something exciting happened, so I was able to follow the action textually, within seconds of it happening.

The basic idea is that you post messages (<span class="emphasis"><em>tweets</em></span>) for your <span class="emphasis"><em>followers</em></span> to see. People can choose to follow you by clicking a button when they view your user profile. You can choose to follow other people too—when you do this, all of their tweets will be displayed on your Twitter home page for you to read.

If there’s nothing in there, you probably need to go to the Twitter site and start “following” some people—just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Follow</strong></span> button on their profile page, and any posts they make will turn up for you to read in Gwibber.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_recent_tweets_in_the_main_gwibbe"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4581"/><img alt="Viewing recent tweets in the main Gwibber window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263544.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-22. Viewing recent tweets in the main Gwibber window</p></div><p>To send your own tweets, click the New Message button in the top right of the Gwibber window (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_new_message_button_in_the_gwibber_wi" title="Figure 5-23. The New Message button in the Gwibber window">Figure 5-23</a>) and type something into the message box at the bottom of the window: <strong class="userinput"><code>Ubuntu is awesome</code></strong>, for example.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_new_message_button_in_the_gwibber_wi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4596"/><img alt="The New Message button in the Gwibber window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263546.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-23. The New Message button in the Gwibber window</p></div><p>You’re allowed a maximum of 140 characters per tweet, and the number of characters you have remaining is displayed in the bottom right of the box.

Move the mouse over a message in the main pane, and a colored icon (a t for Twitter) will appear inside it, at the top right of the message. Click it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Reply</strong></span> from the menu that pops up, and the message box will appear containing that person’s username with an @ sign in front of it (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#replying_to_a_tweet" title="Figure 5-24. Replying to a tweet">Figure 5-24</a>). This is how you reply to someone else’s tweet (sometimes called an “at-reply” because the @ symbol is used). Just type your message as normal, but after the other person’s username.</p><p>There are a few other options to choose from in the menu that appears when you click the colored icon (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#spreading_interesting_tweets_using_the_r" title="Figure 5-25. Spreading interesting tweets using the Retweet option">Figure 5-25</a>). <span class="emphasis"><em>Retweet</em></span> is an interesting one—click it, and you’ll post a copy of the message for all your friends/followers to see. This is how Twitter users share links and spread news throughout the network. It’s often the case that you hear about something cool from the friend of a friend of a friend, all thanks to these retweets.</p><div class="figure"><a id="replying_to_a_tweet"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4634"/><img alt="Replying to a tweet" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263548.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-24. Replying to a tweet</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="spreading_interesting_tweets_using_the_r"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4642"/><img alt="Spreading interesting tweets using the Retweet option" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263550.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-25. Spreading interesting tweets using the Retweet option</p></div><p>If you’re finished with Gwibber for now, just close the window.
