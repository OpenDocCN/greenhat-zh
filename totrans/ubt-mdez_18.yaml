- en: So far you’ve been introduced to a good number of the applications that either
    come bundled with Ubuntu or are available from the Ubuntu Software Center, and
    many of those could be considered “around-the-house” sort of applications. There
    are, however, other applications and even some extensions that you can add to
    your system that will provide still more around-the-house functionality. These
    include things that might not fit clearly in any of the preceding chapters but
    do fit under the home banner. Here you’ll learn about a number of these applications
    that can make your Ubuntu-powered machine a more thoroughly functioning part of
    your home life. All are available from the Ubuntu Software Center unless otherwise
    noted.

    more keen than at home. If you are looking for personal financial management software
    to make household budgeting a bit easier to deal with, then you’ll be happy to
    know that there are quite a few Linux offerings for you. The one that is probably
    easiest to use is called HomeBank ([Figure 18-1](ch18.html#home_money_management_with_homebank
    "Figure 18-1. Home money management with HomeBank")), which is also available
    for Windows and Mac OS systems. HomeBank sports a number of features, including
    the ability to show multiple accounts and generate reports and graphical charts.
    It can import and export files created by the popular finance programs Quicken
    (*.qif*) and Intuit (*.q fx*), and it can also import spreadsheet-generated comma-separated
    values (*.csv*) files. Because it is a cross-platform application, it has a pretty
    good-sized user community out there, so you should be able to find help online
    easily if necessary. In fact, there are links to the HomeBank user manual, tutorials,
    FAQs, and community LaunchPad forum at [http://homebank.free.fr/](http://homebank.free.fr/).

    parental control settings. There are a couple of parental control packages for
    Ubuntu. One, called Nanny, is in the Ubuntu Software Center but does not yet work
    with the new Ubuntu 12.04 release. Another, timekpr, can work after a bit of trickery
    at the command line but is not included in the Ubuntu Software Center. Nanny is
    useful in that it allows you to control web access, but since we want something
