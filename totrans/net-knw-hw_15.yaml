    a network and either convert it back to its original form or use it as input data
    for a computer. With the right kind of input and output devices, you can use the
    same network that shares computer resources to monitor and control industrial
    processes, listen to sound from a microphone or watch images from a camera, distribute
    audio and video through your home or business, and operate equipment by remote
    control. And if the network is connected to the Internet, you can do all those
    things to or from anywhere with an Internet connection.

    an entertainment server to speakers and video displays in several locations around

    convert them into digital audio files. A camera (known as a *webcam*) can capture
    images that a computer or server can convert to still or moving image files. An
    audio or video server can be either a computer with an internal or external microphone
    or a camera (or both) or a stand-alone device that connects directly to the network.
    When another computer receives the same audio and/or video files through a network,
    it can display the images on a display monitor and play the sounds through one
    or more speakers or through a pair of headphones.

    sounds that you can play through headphones or speakers. Some of these formats
    use *compressed* audio that squeezes the data into smaller files. Others use larger
    *uncompressed* files that maintain all the original details. The most common format
    for compressed audio files is MP3\. The most widely used formats for uncompressed
    files include WAV and AIFF. [Table 15-1](ch15s03.html#common_audio_file_formats
    "Table 15-1. Common Audio File Formats") lists the formats that you're most likely

- en: The choice of format is a trade-off between the size of the file and the quality
    of the sound. As a rule of thumb, sound quality increases with file size, as measured
    in bits per second. A WAV file of a music track might require eight to ten times
    as much storage space as an MP3 file of the same recording, but the WAV file is
    almost always a more accurate copy of the original. The compressed MP3 file occupies
    less space on a hard drive and can travel across the network more quickly, but
    the added bits in the WAV file will mean that the music has less distortion and
    better frequency response (the range between the lowest bass notes and the highest
    treble tones). In other words, an MP3 file might sound like the recording played
    through an AM radio, whereas the same music played from a WAV file could sound
    at least as good as a very good CD player.

    it would seem that there isn't a lot of difference between a TV screen and a computer
    monitor. But they use different methods to accomplish the same objective, and
    these methods create problems when you try to move from one to the other. The
    difficulty arises because of the way computer monitors and TV screens break an
    image into scan lines and pixels. For the purpose of this explanation, we can
    think about a still picture, but the same problems can also occur in a moving
    image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In North America, an analog TV shows images as a sequence of 535 scan lines
    from left to right across the face of the screen; when the TV reaches the end
    of one scan line, it moves down to the next one. In digital TV, the screen is
    divided into a large number of dots called *picture elements*, or *pixels*. The
    method used by the TV to light up segments of scan lines or pixels is different
    on picture tubes and flat panels, but the number of scan lines or pixels is specified
    by industry standards. The size of the screen doesn't matter; the number of scan
    lines or pixels on a screen is always the same (there are several different standards
    for flat panels, depending on size and cost, but the number of pixels is constant
    for each standard).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computer monitors also use pixels, but the number of pixels in an image is different,
    depending on screen resolution. When you change your monitor's resolution from,
    say, 800 × 600 pixels to 1280 × 1024 pixels, the computer adjusts the number of
    pixels within a 1-inch (2.5 cm) square space on the screen or any other image
    area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To show a computer image on a TV screen, the controller must adjust the number
    of scan lines or pixels to fit the area available on the monitor. If the TV screen
    expects more scan lines or pixels than the incoming signal, the controller will
    duplicate occasional lines or pixels or it will create a new line that is a blend
    of the one above and the one below. If the computer sends too many scan lines
    or pixels, the screen will skip some of them. This process is called *video scaling*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Video scaling has two effects: It forces the video controller to work hard
    to change the size (and sometimes the shape) of the image, which can slow down
    performance, and it sends an image to the TV screen that can suffer from smeared
    colors, looser focus, jagged edges, and distorted pictures. A good controller
    can make adjustments that minimize these problems, but don''t be surprised if
    the image your computer displays on a TV screen (even a very good high-definition
    TV screen) is not as sharp as the same image on a computer monitor; a good DVI-to-HDMI
    image on an HDTV can be sharper than a VGA display when everything works together

    to justify the added cost), but home appliances with Internet connections are
    available, and more will probably come along in the next few years. Networked
    connections can allow you to control your household TV, refrigerator, microwave
    oven, and other appliances through the Internet or from a mobile telephone—even
    when you're away from home. Combined with built-in diagnostic modules, a network
    connection will also make it possible to identify problems and notify a service
    bureau that can either send back a software fix or dispatch a repair person before
    the problem turns into a catastrophic failure.

    order to assure that appliances made by different manufacturers will communicate
    with one another through a home network, including the Living Network Control
    Protocol (LnCP), developed by LG Electronics and adopted by several other (mostly
    Korean) manufacturers, and the Association for Home Appliance Manufacturers' (AHAM)
    standard for Connected Home Appliances (CHA-1). It's too early to know whether
    LnCP, CHA-1, or some other specification will ultimately emerge as an industry-wide
    standard, but it's likely that some method for exchanging data among appliances
    and other devices through a home network will become common within the next few
    years.

    control unit, dedicated client software, or a web-based interface to run the appliance's

    statewide system of radio transmitters or a scientific study that allows researchers
    in multiple locations to track environmental conditions through the Web), but
    some can be adapted for a home or small business network. For example, a water
    detector in the cellar might trigger an alarm or send an email message, or an
    intrusion alarm, a fire alarm, and a remote temperature sensor in a barn could
    all connect to a network on a farm through a Wi-Fi link to a computer or other
    monitoring device in the house. Or with the right kind of equipment connected
    to your home network, you could send an instruction through the Internet from
    your workplace in case of a sudden snowstorm that would turn on heating coils
    embedded in your driveway and melt the ice before you arrive home. For that matter,
    you could even operate a model railroad through your network, but you'll need
    somebody near the tracks to take care of derailments and other scale-model disasters!
