- en: This program was written by a friend of mine while we were both at college.
    The homework assignment was to write a matrix-multiply routine. However, the function
    itself had to be written in assembly language. In order to make it run as fast
    as possible, he used an algorithm that I designed, which vectorized the matrix.

    When we tested the program, we got the wrong answers. Both of us poured over every
    line of that code from 8:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. the next morning. When we finally
    found the error, we both burst out laughing because it was such a silly mistake.

    entirely in one language (C) and uses a much simpler multiplication algorithm.
    But the original bug still remains. What's going on?

- en: ^([[2](#N18)])SAIL was an old system programming language for the PDP-10\. The
    debugger was called BAIL. Later a machine independent version of the language
    was created called MAIN SAIL. It pre-dated C by several years.
