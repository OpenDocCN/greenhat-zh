    is far too much that needs to be fixed for that! Wikipedia's broad concept of
    cleanup includes most tasks to improve articles once they have been created. Any
    time you need a break from writing new articles, you'll find plenty of work waiting
    for you on existing ones.

    interested editors to discuss articles and perform certain formal tasks. Processes
    are the practical implementation of policies and provide a structure for day-to-day
    work. We''ll discuss two of the biggest processes: deleting articles and promoting
    good content. The activities described in this chapter are at the heart of the
    collaborative editing and article improvement that make Wikipedia work.'

    at any time, Wikipedia has developed a variety of mechanisms to sort out articles
    in need of help, so editors can find them and address cleanup issues more easily.
    In this section, we''ll describe the basic mechanism for identifying and flagging
    articles as needing help, and then we''ll discuss the broad categories of issues
    and how to find articles with these issues.'

    Working on articles that need to be cleaned up reveals the kinds of problems that
    Wikipedia faces, and dealing with similar issues and problems in a number of articles
    is an excellent way to learn Wikipedia style and develop proficiency at encyclopedic
    writing (and by extension, any type of writing). Cleanup is also one of the best
    ways to contribute; Wikipedia always has a tremendous backlog of cleanup needing
    to be done. Thoroughly improving a poorly written article can also be immensely
    satisfying: You can always compare the before and after versions of the article
    from the page history to see just how much you accomplished.'

    tagged as needing a certain kind of cleanup; they can simply go to the category
    and get to work. For instance, articles tagged with `{{cleanup}}` are placed in
    [[Category:All pages needing cleanup]]. Articles tagged with a dated cleanup tag
    are automatically sorted into a cleanup-by-month category as well (in the example
    above, [[Category:Cleanup from November 2007]]), so those with older tags can
    be worked on first. This also makes the large cleanup category more manageable.
    If you edit out the template to remove it, the article will automatically be removed
    from the cleanup category.

    is reflected in some of the large cleanup categories. These categories have *backlogs*—large
    numbers of articles awaiting attention. Wikipedia's rapid growth has perhaps made
    this inevitable. Because there is so much to do, adding a template for every issue
    isn't really helpful, as this may, in fact, mask an article's worst issues; if
    a quick edit can resolve the problem, instead of adding a template, go ahead and
    fix it (the *sofixit* principle described in [Chapter 13](hw-wkpd-wk_16.html "Chapter 13. Policy
    and Your Input")). Make sure, however, that you flag the biggest issues if you
    can't fix them right away. As of early 2008, roughly 31,000 articles are in [[Category:All
    pages needing cleanup]]. Working in this category can be overwhelming; on the
    other hand, 31,000 represents less than 2 percent of the total number of articles
    on Wikipedia at this time.

    of the most important ongoing work on Wikipedia. *Vandalism* is, by definition,
    a change made to Wikipedia with the malicious intention of having a negative effect
    on the content. Disputes over content may lead to accusations of vandalism, but
    no editor should *ever* use the word lightly—always *assume good faith* unless
    you have very good reason not to. Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia,
    even if misguided or ill-considered, is *not* vandalism. See [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]]

    against the most problematic editors.

    version with the version you are reverting to make sure you''re only undoing vandalism,
    and then add an edit summary: *rvv vandalism* is common.) Many editors use their
    watchlists for just this purpose, scanning the list of changes on a regular basis
    to check for suspect edits that might be vandalism. Others devote substantial
    time to watching Recent Changes and other logs. Most vandalism is obvious: cutting
    content for no reason or inserting obscenities, crude humor, or nonsense. If you
    find a vandalized page, you should spend a couple of minutes reviewing the page
    history; vandal edits tend to be clustered, and you may have to revert several
    edits to find the "latest good version" or a version of the page that hasn''t
    been vandalized at all (see "Fixing Mistakes and Other Reasons to Revert" on [Fixing

    edits will happen. As noted in [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html "Chapter 4. Understanding
    and Evaluating an Article"), however, most of these edits are caught quickly.
    The offenders are often young, and most vandalism is juvenile. Some persistent
    or more subtle vandals can succeed for a while. But Wikipedia defends in depth,
    not just with one front line. Wikipedia works by self-healing.

    processes include some that implement Wikipedia's official policies, such as the
    deletion processes, the Featured Article candidate process, the various dispute
    resolution processes, and the Request for Adminship process for administrator
    promotion. Other processes focus on making specific maintenance tasks routine,
    such as renaming categories or approving bots.

    at all, and dispute resolution processes help editors who are arguing come to
    agreement. But Wikipedia has no formal form of adjudication for rival views of
    suitable article content. Editors are supposed to engage with others about their
    differing conceptions and deal with disagreements through discussion and common
    sense and with the assumption that everyone is on the encyclopedia's side. A content
    decision process would turn into an editorial board for the site, which is against
    the fundamental ideas of openness and community that are key to Wikipedia. Status
    on Wikipedia does not allow anyone to dictate content.

    deleted—hundreds or thousands of articles are deleted from Wikipedia every day.
    Clearly, not all articles that are created belong in the encyclopedia, but what
    should stay and what should go is not always obvious. The *article deletion* process
    is used to decide what should be deleted. Primarily used as a housekeeping measure,
    this process is mainly applied to poorly chosen topics—ones that don't, and can't,
    lead to proper encyclopedia articles.

    entirely, so readers cannot see the page or the page's history. Deleting is not
    the same thing as blanking a page by saving an empty revision; in deletion, the
    history of a deleted article, with access to all revisions, is also deleted. All
    traces of contributions to that article also disappear from the site—changes to
    a deleted article won't appear in user contributions, watchlists, Recent Changes,
    or Related Changes. The articles do not vanish entirely, however; deleted articles
    are still visible to administrators, which allows them to review deletions and
    restore content (*undeleting*) in case a mistake was made. Each deleted article
    is also logged in a special list, the deletion log, at [[Special:Logs]].

    is open for anyone to discuss the fate of articles proposed for deletion. Wikipedia
    has very specific—and complicated—rules for how pages should be deleted and a
    large body of past discussion on the subject. Because Wikipedia leans toward including
    as much as possible, deletion is generally seen as a bad solution if the article
    can be salvaged. Articles are *not* deleted when the only issue is that they need
    to be cleaned up or are stubs. Articles are also not deleted based on anyone's
    personal dislike of the subject matter—Wikipedia has no censorship. How much emphasis
    to put on deleting content is a long-running philosophical debate on the site;
    see [Chapter 12](hw-wkpd-wk_15.html "Chapter 12. Community and Communication")

    Some articles can't possibly be cleaned up. Submitted pages may be nonsense, graffiti,
    not in English, life stories, advertisements, blatant copyright violations, and
    spam articles containing nothing but the URL of a website. These examples are
    not particularly contentious, and many of these types of articles are deleted
    almost as soon as they are submitted, as part of routine vandalism control (this
    falls under the speedy deletion process described in the next section).
  prefs: []

    Wikipedia's content policies is more controversial. Sometimes the violation is
    clear; plain dictionary definitions or pieces of original research just don't
    fit within the scope of the encyclopedia. Many articles are deleted because they
    violate the principle of notability, and this violation is harder to determine.
    It can also lead to contention—no one likes being told that their company is "not
    notable." In these deletion discussions, editors discussing the deletion may need
    to do outside research to find out more about the topic and thoroughly assess
    the article and whether it belongs in the encyclopedia. Occasionally, editors
    decide that although the topic doesn't merit its own article, the content should
    be merged or otherwise incorporated into another article.
  prefs: []

- en: Notability can be a problematic notion. If an article's topic violates the principle
    of notability, then the article will likely be deleted. But turning that around,
    the best working definition of *notability* comes from which topics are and are
    not deleted. Applying notability is not an exact science. As discussed in [Chapter 1](hw-wkpd-wk_02.html
    "Chapter 1. What's in Wikipedia?"), notability guidelines have been set up for
    various topics to help guide decisions, but these don't provide exact criteria.
    Saying that a TV actor is notable because he or she has 421 minutes on screen
    but not with 419 minutes on screen would be ridiculous, as would be declaring
    someone notable who has received 76 column inches of industry press but not with
    74 inches.

- en: On the other hand, precedent is not binding on Wikipedia—and particularly not
    in deletion discussions. Many Wikipedians argue that one article's existence does
    not mean another article on the same topic should be automatically included. For
    instance, just because an article about one actor is on the site does not mean
    an article about another actor should also be included by default. Each article
    should be assessed on its own merits and measured against the basic content policies.
    Thus deletion discussions are about individual articles, not whole classes of
    articles.

    community discussion and a dedicated debate, whereas proposed deletions (PRODs;
    see WP:PROD) and speedy deletions (*speedies*, or sometimes *CSD*, which is short
    for Criteria for Speedy Deletion, the policy page) do not. Speedy deletions are
    the most common, due to the sheer volume of nonsense articles submitted. Articles
    that don't meet speedy deletion guidelines may get deleted though the Articles
    for Deletion process or the proposed deletion process instead, and contested speedy
    and proposed deletions are often referred to the AfD process. In other words,
    when the quicker deletion processes prove contentious, Wikipedia has the more
    serious AfD as a fallback.

    the article should not in fact be deleted, he or she can simply remove the template
    and the case is closed. This is called *contesting the PROD*, and at this point,
    if the nominator wants to pursue it, he or she must submit the article to AfD
    for discussion in order to delete it. If, at the end of the five days, no one

- en: Rather than being deleted, some very good articles are promoted in status. *Good
    articles (GA)* and *featured articles (FA)* are two levels of articles that the
    community has determined to be some of the best content on Wikipedia. Reviewing
    and working constructively on articles is one of the key skills of an involved
    Wikipedian. This skill also applies in formal or informal peer review (as noted
    in [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research")) and
    on WikiProjects. Gauge content with an eye to improving it. (Working on good articles
    is also recommended as an antidote to the burnout caused by the other extreme—immersion
    in deletion debates.)

- en: Finding and browsing featured articles was described in [Chapter 3](hw-wkpd-wk_04.html
    "Chapter 3. Finding Wikipedia's Content"). Wikipedia also has featured review
    processes for media, images, lists, and portals. Relative to the rest of Wikipedia's
    content, few articles have been designated good or featured, with only about 1
    in 660 articles listed as good and 1 in 1,200 listed as featured. However, many
    good-quality articles aren't on these lists—those that haven't gone through the
    formal processes. The criteria for good and featured articles are basically those
    mentioned in [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research"),
    but in the processes, you can experience the criteria in action, as debated through
    open peer review. For either process, anyone can nominate an article and anyone
    can review it, though featured articles require a more complex review. If it is
    difficult for you to receive detailed criticism of your own work, remember the
    *no ownership* rule. Most articles under review improve greatly, regardless of
    the eventual outcome.

    (shortcut WP:GAC). To nominate an article, simply follow the instructions on this
    page and place the corresponding Good Article Candidate template on the article''s
    talk page. In turn, any editor can choose to review the article (typically, only
    one person will review the article). The criteria for review are listed at [[Wikipedia:Good
    article criteria]] (shortcut WP:GA?). The review process is supposed to be fairly
    informal. Reviewers read through the article and evaluate it based on the criteria,
    and then they have three options: They may *pass* the article as being a good
    article, *fail* the article if they feel it doesn''t meet the criteria, or make
    suggestions for improvement by placing the article *on hold*. Often reviewers
    make detailed constructive comments. Articles that pass are added to the list
    of good articles at [[Wikipedia:Good articles]] (shortcut WP:GA). Articles that
    fail need to be improved. An article can be renominated once the criticisms have
    been addressed.'

- en: Featured articles go through a more formal community peer review process, typically
    with several different editors participating as reviewers. This review is based
    on [[Wikipedia:Featured article criteria]](shortcut WP:FACR). The criteria include,
    for example, appropriate use of images. Reviews take place at [[Wikipedia:Featured
    article candidates]] (shortcut WP:FAC). Here, you can find between 50 and 100
    candidates that are under current scrutiny. Reviewer comments are likely to be
    detailed and extensive, ranging from minor issues, such as formatting, to major
    issues, such as unclear writing or missing references. Anyone can nominate an
    article to be featured, but by convention, the nominator is supposed to stick
    around for the review and help out with fixing up the article. The process is
    intended as a dialogue, with the nominator responding to the critique by working
    on the article's issues. Others are also welcome to help, but an article that
    doesn't improve at all in response to criticism isn't likely to pass. Directions
    for nominating a new article are on the Featured Article Candidates page (shortcut
    WP:FAC), along with directions for commenting on nominations. An article should
    not be nominated for good article status and featured article status at the same
    time, but a good article can later be nominated for featured article status.

- en: Articles that pass (sometimes only after several rounds of review) are then
    added to the list at [[Wikipedia:Featured articles]] (shortcut WP:FA). Any featured
    article may then be listed as Today's featured article on the main page of the
    site; the current month's selections are listed at [[Wikipedia:Today's featured
    article]]. Featured articles that degrade in quality may be reviewed through the
    featured article review process ([[Wikipedia:Featured article review]]), where
    anyone with concerns can nominate a currently featured article for discussion
    about whether that status should be removed.

- en: As part of the overall task of upgrading and updating Wikipedia, a vast range
    of jobs are accomplished by small teams or through local, open discussions. These
    collaborations and discussions are how the apparently anarchic Wikipedia works.
    Behind the scenes, a large and diverse population of supporting projects and processes
    are at work. What they all have in common is that editors operate within loose
    frameworks, communicating and pooling efforts to improve the encyclopedia.
