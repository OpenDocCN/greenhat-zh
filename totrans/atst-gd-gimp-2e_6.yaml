    much like the ones you left behind. So it is with GIMP. It takes patience to find
    the tools or filters that perform a given task, but the end result will be just
    as recognizable and familiar to you.

    image but are also used for coloring. The easy way of using a flame to color a
    layer is to first desaturate the layer, and then add a flame layer above and set
    the flame layer mode to whatever “looks right.” However, if you place an image
    below a flame layer, the black region around the flame may block that lower layer
    from being visible, depending on the flame layer’s blend mode. To avoid this,
    you’ll use layer masks on flame layers or simply copy and paste flames, taking
    care to omit the black backgrounds from your source image.

    done because the scaled image quickly becomes pixelated. However, in this case
    the pixelation is hardly noticeable because of the weakly identifiable shapes
    (the ornate structure has no discernible objects—it’s just wavy lines). Additionally,
    using multiple copies of a frame layer and blending layer modes hides some of
    the pixelation, and, later, coloring with flames hides even more. The sheer size
    of this image also hides some of that pixelation when working onscreen. Large
    prints, however, would likely show the pixelation. Therefore, any prints for this
    size image when layers were scaled up would need to be no larger than the size
    of a magazine or book page.

    The settings depend on the content of the rain layers, but the Brightness should
    be less than –100 and the Contrast raised to near 127.

    the **Rectangle Select** tool to cut out the bottom half of the selection. If
    necessary, use the Scale tool to appropriately resize the lamp above the lamp
    post. Use the **Move** tool to position the selection over the left lamp post.
    Use the **Rotate** tool to align the straight edge of the selection with the guideline.
    Choose the **Blend** tool and drag a Linear gradient from black to gray starting
    at the top of the curve of the selection down to the straight edge.

    base. In the Tool Options dialog, convert the path to a selection. Choose the
    **Blend** tool from the toolbox and configure it to use a linear gradient that
    flows from white to transparent. Click near the top of the selection in the image
    window and drag toward the bottom. Follow the line of the lamp post to align the
    gradient properly.

    The high color contrast should allow most of the tie to be selected completely

    outside the tie is selected. Copy the selection.
