- en: In general, installing a wireless network adapter is easy because most network
    adapters are plug-and-play devices. As soon as you connect the adapter to your
    computer, or as soon as you turn on an internal adapter or your computer, the
    computer automatically detects the device and runs the control software to set
    up a connection.

    or the socket adapter that fits an expansion slot in a desktop computer (yes,
    that does mean that one kind of adapter sometimes plugs into another kind of adapter).
    To install the PC Card, just insert it gently but firmly into the socket. When
    it's properly seated, you should feel the holes on the edge of the card grab the
    pins inside the socket.

- en: Most wireless PC Card adapters contain internal antennas that extend an inch
    or more beyond the outer edge of the PCMCIA socket. However, a few adapters come
    with connectors for external antennas. If you are using an external antenna, place
    the antenna in the location where you want to operate it, and run the antenna
    cable from the antenna to the network adapter's antenna connector. *Be gentle*.
    Often the tiny connectors used by laptop adapters are fragile, and damaging the
    connectors or cables can lead to loss of signal.

    or with external antennas that are connected to the adapter through a hinge that
    allows the antenna element to move around, like the one shown in [Figure 5-1](ch05s02.html#this_usb_wi-fi_adapter_has_a_permanently
    "Figure 5-1. This USB Wi-Fi adapter has a permanently attached external antenna.").
    Because the adapter connects to the computer through a cable, it's easy to move
    the whole adapter around when the first position you try doesn't detect an adequate
    signal from the access point.

    it's a good idea to remove the PC Card from the socket before you install the

    a percentage value, but they don't tell you what a signal at 100 percent strength
    is 100 percent *of*. It's important to understand that signal strength and signal
    quality are not the same thing; a wireless adapter does not have to receive a
    signal at full strength to move data at the maximum possible speed. As long as
    the receiver can capture a clean signal, the network's performance should be acceptable.
    But even a strong signal can suffer if the receiver also picks up interference
    from other wireless networks or from other devices that use the same radio frequencies,
    such as wireless telephones and microwave ovens.
  prefs: []

- en: And even if the data transfer speed is slower than the maximum possible rate,
    it might not make any real difference. For example, if you're using a Wi-Fi network
    to connect your computer to the Internet through a DSL line (at about 1.5Mbps
    or less), it won't matter if your local wireless network speed drops from 11Mbps
    down to 2Mbps; that's still a lot more bandwidth than you need because the slower
    DSL line is the slowest part of the overall connection. On the other hand, when
    you use the same networks for computer-to-computer file transfers, a faster wireless
    link will make a noticeable difference.
  prefs: []

- en: The spread spectrum radio signal used in a Wi-Fi network is not the same as
    an FM radio signal, but the interference and signal quality problems are similar.
    If you live in or near a big city, you can probably receive a dozen or more FM
    radio stations on your kitchen radio. Some of these stations might have transmitters
    close to your house, and others transmit from the other side of town or even farther
    away. But as long as your radio can capture a station at a minimum useful level,
    the radio reproduces the music reasonably well; the signal from the little teakettle
    college radio station a mile away sounds just as good as the big commercial station
    with a much more powerful transmitter up in the hills (this is a technical discussion—programming
    is a whole other question). On the other hand, if you're out on the fringes of
    the station's coverage area, or if there's another nearby station using the same
    frequency, the sound of the station you want to hear might be noisy and hard to
    understand. In the same way, the overall quality of a wireless network link is
    affected by both signal strength and the presence or absence of unwanted noise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technical definition of *noise* in an information channel is *any unwanted
    energy or information*. The only thing you want your network adapter to receive
    is the digital signal that came from the access point you want to use; so everything
    else that shows up at the receiver is noise. This can include interference from
    other wireless data networks and other radios using the same frequencies (such
    as cordless telephones, microwave ovens, and medical electronics) and interference
    from natural sources such as lightning. Up to a point, the digital technology
    and spread spectrum radio system used in an 802.11b network can do a pretty good
    job of ignoring interference, but when the noise is just as strong as the signal
    you want, the network will apply its error correction features until it can confirm
    that an intelligible signal has made it from the transmitter to the receiver.
  prefs: []

    As the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases, the amount
    of energy that the receiver detects will decrease until the signal is simply too
    weak for the receiver to decode the data. And if there are physical obstructions
    that absorb some of the radiated energy between the transmitter and the receiver,
    the useful signal range will be even shorter. That's why Wi-Fi reception is better
    outdoors than indoors.

- en: 'It''s possible to use a high-gain antenna to increase the signal strength,
    and you can raise the antenna to the top of a tower or a tall building to increase
    the useful distance that it will travel, but at some point the signal strength
    will be too weak to be useful. That''s why most wireless network utility programs
    show separate readings for signal strength and signal quality. When a problem
    does occur, you can use the two measurements to help identify the source of the
    problem: If the signal is strong but the quality is low, the problem is probably
    caused by some kind of interference, but if both signal quality and signal strength
    are low, it''s likely that you''re too far away from the nearest access point
    or there''s some kind of obstruction between you and the access point.'

- en: 'Any time the network fails to transmit a data packet successfully, the device
    at the receiving end instructs the transmitting device to send the same packet
    again. This can happen when there is noise or interference on the link (radio
    or wired), when other users are trying to use the same channel at the same time,
    or when a radio signal is too weak for the receiver to decode the data contained
    in the packet. One or two repeated packets in a data stream won''t make any real
    difference, but when it becomes necessary to send almost every packet several
    times before the receiver accepts it, the actual data transfer speed will be half
    or less of the nominal speed. A pair of Wi-Fi radios might try to compensate for
    a poor signal by dropping the transmission speed (this is the same kind of approach
    as speaking slowly and distinctly over a noisy telephone line), but the effect
    is often the same: It takes longer to receive the data.'

    it can also happen when there's heavy traffic on a server or some kind of noise
    on the wired portion of the network.

- en: To isolate the source of the problem, run your Wi-Fi status program or a signal
    monitor program like NetStumbler on the client computer. If the signal strength
    is low, try moving to a different location away from obstructions between your
    computer and the access point. If the signal strength is adequate but signal quality
    is poor, the network adapter is probably receiving noise along with the network
    data; look for a signal from an access point that uses a different channel number.
    If you can, move your network to other channel numbers as far away as possible
    from the other networks near you to find a segment of the spectrum that has fewer
    competing signals. And if both signal strength and signal quality are adequate
    but the data transfer speed is slow, the cause is probably in the server or someplace
    else in the network.
