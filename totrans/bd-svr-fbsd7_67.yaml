- en: Blogs have gained popularity with the advent of tools like WordPress. Justin
    Hall, a writer and graduate student, is recognized as being one of the first to
    create a personal blog in 1994\. Another notable figure, David Winer, created
    ping servers, which keep records of updates received from blogging applications.
    Ping servers allow blog readers to quickly check a blog for updated content; [technorati.com](http://technorati.com)
    is a popular example of this concept. Winer also created the RSS specification
    that enables users to see new content on a blog using an RSS-capable client.
