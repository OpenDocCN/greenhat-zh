- en: If you’re standing in the aisle of your local bookstore reading this right now,
    you may well be wondering who this book is for. *Ubuntu Made Easy*, as you might
    imagine, is for readers who are interested in Linux but who feel the need for
    a jumping-off point to get started.

- en: If you’re familiar with computers but unfamiliar with Linux, or if you are somewhat
    familiar with Linux but not with Ubuntu, this book is for you. This is not primarily
    a book for seasoned geeks or power users; it’s an introductory guide that will
    provide you with some hands-on experience to get up, running, and comfortable
    with the Ubuntu Linux distribution without pain. Think of this book as a map,
    a compass, and a comfy pair of hiking boots rather than a harness, a rope, and
    a set of crampons.

    The CD bundled with this book is the Ubuntu Desktop CD, which lets you both try
    Ubuntu without installing it and install Ubuntu to your hard drive once you’re
    ready. It’s called a live CD. You can boot your computer from the CD and run Ubuntu
    directly off the CD without touching your hard disk to see if you like Ubuntu
    and to make sure that Ubuntu will work with your hardware. If, after running the
    live CD, you like what you see and everything seems to work, you can install Ubuntu
    on your computer using the same disc. (There are instructions for doing so in
    [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Wading and Diving").)'
