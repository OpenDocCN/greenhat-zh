- en: A vast guide to the Ruby language and libraries, the so-called Pickaxe book
    is generally considered to be an essential Ruby reference. It’s not a light read,
    though, and not (in my view) the best first book on Ruby. All the same, you may
    need it sooner or later. The second edition covers Ruby 1.8; the third edition
    covers Ruby 1.9.

- en: The book provides a gentle introduction to Ruby programming. The explanations
    are clear, and the code examples are useful. The second edition covers some aspects
    of Ruby 1.9 but not in much detail. If you already have some programming experience
    and want an accessible introduction to the world of Ruby, this would be a good
    book.

- en: This is a solid, in-depth book on aspects of Ruby programming. In the introductory
    section, the author states that because of its relative lack of tutorial material,
    “You probably won’t learn Ruby from this book.” He describes it more as a “sort
    of ‘inverted reference.’ Rather than looking up the name of a method or a class,
    you will look things up by function or purpose.” Personally, I think he underestimates
    the tutorial value of *The Ruby Way*. The author does, however, assume you are
    already reasonably adept at programming.

- en: This is, in large part, an adaptation of David Black’s previous book, *Ruby
    for Rails*, though this time the author concentrates on the Ruby language rather
    than the Rails framework. It covers Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 but is rather vague on the
    precise differences between the two versions. It’s a decent introductory book
    for fairly experienced programmers.

    compete for the claim to being essential, but I know of no other Rails book that
    comes anywhere close to rivaling *Agile Web Development with Rails* for its comprehensive
    coverage of its subject. The third edition covers Rails 2\. The fourth edition
    covers Rails 3.
