    you haven’t installed Fedora Core yet and are ready and raring to do so, then
    you had better stay right where you are and read on. In this chapter, I will guide
    you through the installation steps and review everything you need to do before
    that in order to get Linux up and running on your machine.

    password, a user account name, and a user password. You will be asked for this
    information during installation, so it will be good to get it out of the way here.

    Linux asks that you have at least two accounts: a *root* account and a *user*
    account. The root account is there automatically; all you have to do is come up
    with a password. The root account is used for system administration chores, such
    as installing programs or changing system settings.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for the user account, this you will set up yourself during the post- installation
    process at the end of this chapter. You decide on your own username and password.
    The user account is the one that you use for your everyday computing chores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, if you are doing anything other than altering the system setup in
    some way, you should be using your user account. This is Linux’s way of protecting
    you from yourself, so that in the course of your everyday computer use you will
    not damage the system by doing anything dumb. If you screw anything up, it will
    only affect your personal data; the system will remain intact.
  prefs: []

- en: With your root account powers, you can create additional user accounts at any
    time. Let’s say that your family wants to use your computer, but you don’t want
    them messing around with your files or, worse yet, blitzing the whole system in
    some way. You could use one account for yourself, and then add additional accounts
    for your daughter (Erika), your son (Jethro), and your spouse (Pat).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Under this system, when any one of them starts up your computer, they will only
    be able to log in to their own account, from which they will have no access to
    the system itself or to any of the files in anyone else’s account. Jethro cannot
    read Erika’s private letters; Erika cannot find out what Jethro has bookmarked
    in his Web browser, and your beloved Pat cannot pop open one of your spreadsheet
    files to find out how you are squandering the family fortune — all very safe and
    convenient. Of course, because you set up the computer and, thus, also have access
    to the root account, you can log in as the root user and enter any of their accounts
    to see what is going on. This may not be fair to them, but that is just the way
    things are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you understand the root/user distinction, decide upon a root password
    and a user password. You will be using the user password every time you log in,
    so make sure it is something that you won’t forget and, more importantly, won’t
    mind typing in every day. The root password you won’t really need to use as much,
    although you will be using it quite a bit while doing the projects in this book.
    Still, it should be something that you will remember, because it is very important.

- en: You will also need to come up with a username for yourself. It could be as simple
    as your initials (my username is *rg*) or the name of your favorite tropical fish,
    such as *neontetra*. Whatever you choose, it will appear on your desktop once
    you’ve logged in, so make sure it is a username you don’t mind seeing every day.
    Having to see “stinky’s Home” on your desktop day in and day out could prove a
    little annoying if not embarrassing. By the way, your username cannot have any
    spaces and must be all lowercase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve decided upon your username and your root and user passwords, make
    sure that you write them down on a piece of paper or in a book, and keep it at
    hand until the installation process is over and you have gotten the swing of things.
    After that, you can store it in some safe place — but don’t forget, as I am prone
    to do, where that safe place is. The information is very important, and it is
    easy, as time rolls by, to forget such things, which you definitely do not want
    to do. Holding on to your root password is most important of all, because without
    it you won’t be able to install packages, add users, or even change your printer
    settings.

  prefs: []

- en: It is possible to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same machine
    and for them to happily coexist. In my own case, I started out with just such
    a dual-boot setup. In time, however, I found that I used the Linux side of things
    exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I didn’t
    use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped the whole
    thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup. My feeling is that unless you
    have some application that you really need that is not available on the Linux
    side (probably some game), then go for the Linux-only setup and just forget about
    Windows. Linux has most of what you will need anyway, and because OpenOffice can
    read and write MS Office files, you’ll be well enough connected, if that is of
    concern to you.

    when you install Linux, you might have to reinstall Windows if you don’t like
    Linux or if you can’t get it installed properly. That would be a considerable
    waste of time and energy, to be sure. However, believe it or not, there are advantages
    to my suggestion even if your no-go scenario turns out to be the case.

    has gotten sort of gunked up — it is no longer the quick little kitten it used
    to be. Menus don’t pop open as quickly as they used to, things take longer to
    start up than they did before, and you find yourself saying “what the Sam Habberdack
    is that!” all the time, as mysterious things happen with increasing frequency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is just the nature of the beast, and a very good way of getting things
    back to normal is to reinstall the whole thing. So even if you do decide to come
    back to Windows later, you’ll be doing yourself a favor, because it should run
    better than before. It’s a little more work up front, but in the long run you’ll
    be a happier camper.
  prefs: []

- en: If, on the other hand, you opt for running both Windows and Linux, you will
    be greeted by a Linux boot-selection screen when you start up your machine, from
    which you can choose to continue booting up Linux or choose Windows in its stead.
    After that, boot-up proceeds as normal for the system you selected. This setup
    works fine, so you needn’t worry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, in order to create a dual-boot setup, you will need to have either
    two hard disks (preferable) or at least two partitions on one hard disk. The disk
    or partition on which you intend to install Fedora Core (the non-Windows, or *target,*
    partition) will also have to be at least 5 gigabytes (GB) in size. If you don’t
    have a single partition of that size available but do have two or three that you
    can use, that will do too. And if you don’t have any of these, you can either
    install another internal hard disk or create another partition with some partitioning
    software, such as Partition Magic, before trying to install Fedora Core.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The state of your target partition or disk will determine what creating a dual-
    boot system means for you during the installation process. If, for example, the
    target partition or disk is just unformatted free space, the installation process
    will be much like a straight Linux-only installation. If, however, the target
    hard disk or partition is already formatted in a DOS file system, such as Fat16
    or Fat32, then you will have a bit more work cut out for you during the installation
    process. The dual-boot installation process is explained in the [“Dual-Boot Installation”](DDU0022.html#67)
    section later in the chapter — read through that section to get an idea of whether
    or not you’ll feel comfortable doing what needs to be done.

    like tinkering around, you can just find out by going right to the installation
    steps in the [next section](DDU0021.html#53). If the installation starts up, you

    and cumbersome process. It is not. It will be over more quickly than you can imagine.
    Installation steps 1–23 combined take me less than five minutes to complete. As
    a beginner frequently referring to this text, you might take a bit longer, of
    course, but don’t worry. All in all, the whole process is faster (and I think
    easier) than that for Windows XP or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that with XP and
    OS X, you are installing the operating system with just a few bundled applications.
    In a Fedora Core Linux installation, you are installing not only the operating
    system itself, but also most of the applications you will ever want or need to
    use. You will thus be getting a lot done in one fell swoop.

    a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as if the house is
    going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing somewhere along the line.
    Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as you have backed
    up your data, you will be OK. If you screw up the installation the first time
    out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, as you have nothing to harm.
    Just make sure that you give yourself more time than you need for the process.
    Don’t start installing one hour before you have to be at work, or before you have
    to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes people do weird things. Make things
    easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty of time . . . and by backing up any
    data you would mourn the loss of.

    of your hardware, take less than 20 minutes.

    partition or on another internal hard disk, then you need to follow these installation
    steps, as was mentioned in step 10 in the [previous section](DDU0021.html#53).
    If you are doing a Linux-only install with no Windows on your machine, you can
    ignore this section and move on, unless, of course, you’re just interested.

- en: As I mentioned before, in order to create a dual-boot setup, you will need to
    have an additional hard drive in your machine (preferred) or at least 5GB of space
    (10GB would be better) on a partition that you are willing to commit to Linux
    (other than the one where you have Windows installed). If you do not have a second
    hard drive or an additional partition, you will either have to install another
    hard drive or add another partition to your present drive with a partitioning
    program, such as Partition Magic, before trying to install Fedora. You do not
    need to format or clear the target partition or disk before proceeding; just make
    sure you have one. And again, remember that any data on the partition or disk
    which you are allocating to Linux will be erased for good.

    may seem complicated, but it isn’t bad at all. Just follow the directions as laid
    out, and you should have no problems. You can always go back to change things
    once you’re done, so don’t get too stressed out. The process is rather forgiving.

    will use for your Linux installation by clicking the partition name in the list
    or by clicking the graphical map of your disk setup. Your Windows partition will
    most likely be hda1 (for an IDE drive) or sda1 (for a SCSI drive), so your target
    will probably be hda2 or, in the case of a separate hard disk, sda2, hdb1, or
    sdbOnce you have made your selection, click the **Delete** button in the middle
    of the right half of the screen, which will clear all data and formatting from
