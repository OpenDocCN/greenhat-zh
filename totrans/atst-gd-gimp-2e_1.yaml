    popular open source projects. It allows everyday users on a budget to harness
    the graphical abilities of virtually any computer. Open source means anyone can

    the download and installation instructions for your operating system. GIMP runs
    on all three major platforms: Mac, Windows, and Linux. In fact, if you use Linux,
    it’s probably already installed on your machine. You’ll need to run GIMP 2.8 in
    order to follow along with the tutorials in this book (though the tutorials are
    written to be applicable to the older 2.6 version as well). Come back once you’ve
    got it up and running! These tutorials provide practice and guidance in using
    GIMP’s features but little hand-holding when it comes to the program’s basic tools
    and features. The book assumes that you’ll learn best by experimenting and combining
    effects. If you’re a beginner, read the first section in each chapter carefully,
    and check out GIMP’s official user manual if you get confused (*[http://docs.gimp.org/en/](http://docs.gimp.org/en/)*).'

    resize the window to fit this, you might not have every menu option available
    at the top of the image window. If that happens, use the right-facing arrow to
    access the out-of-view menu options. This menu also provides access to tear-off

    you’ve got the memory and the inclination, feel free to push up these values.
    The most-often modified value is probably the tile cache size. Smaller values
    reduce memory usage by the GIMP but slow processing of large images. If you have
    lots of memory and work on large images, try increasing the value from 128MB to
    256MB. If you’re low on memory, another option is reducing the undo levels. The

    can adjust the opacity of the brushstroke to be applied. Remember that opacity
    is the opposite of transparency, so a higher opacity value means the brushstroke
    will be less transparent.'

    mode for the brushstroke. The Blend mode defines how the stroke blends with the
    existing pixels in the layer where the stroke is applied. Different modes have
    different effects. Addition mode adds the brush’s colors to those in the image,
    causing the image to lighten. Multiply mode causes the image to darken. Overlay
    mode can either lighten or darken the image, depending on the color or pattern
    being applied and the existing content in the layer where the stroke is made.
    Blend modes are also used in layers.'

    tools require that you choose a specific brush. The paint tools even remember
    brushes; you can switch from one to another and back again without losing your
    settings for either tool. The default configuration is for all paint tools to
    share the same brush, but this can be changed in the Preferences dialog under

    **Basic Dynamics**. Then click **Dynamics Options** to display the Fade Options
    and adjust the Fade Length value to determine the length of the stroke before
    the fade. Changing the Dynamics option to Fade Tapering will add a tapered end
    to the fading stroke, as shown in this example. The Ink tool is the only paint
    tool that doesn’t offer this option.

- en: The Pencil Tool
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Pencil tool applies a hard edge, which is important to remember. Making
    the most of the paint tools requires that you understand the difference between
    hard and soft edges. When you work with soft edges, levels of gray or fading color
    in a brush are considered partially transparent and are merged with the existing
    pixels in the canvas. This creates soft edges around the brushstroke. When working
    with a hard edge, if a pixel in the brushstroke is more than 50 percent black
    (or more than 50 percent colored), the pixel in the brushstroke replaces the pixel
    on the canvas, rather than being merged with it. If a pixel in the brushstroke
    is less than 50 percent black or colored, the pixel on the canvas is unchanged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difference is easy to see here, where both the Pencil tool and the Paintbrush
    tool are used in conjunction with the Round Fuzzy (101) and Pepper brushes. The
    Pencil tool uses a hard edge, so there’s no antialiasing of the brush edge, whereas
    the Paintbrush tool uses a soft edge. For this reason, you probably won’t use
    the Pencil much when working with masks or editing photos.

    The Paintbrush tool is perfect for creating layer masks and creating selections

    makes it ideal for closely matching curves.
  prefs: []

    if the Paintbrush tool is active and you hold the mouse button over the canvas

    drag the cursor around the canvas.

    a lighter or darker stroke, depending on the Rate and Flow values set in the Tool

    cursor doesn’t move. For these reasons, the Airbrush tool is useful for enhancing
    shading and lighting in images.

    masks and selections in [1.4 Selections](ch01.html#onedot4_selections "1.4 Selections").)

    when you combine all three channels, you end up with 2,563 possible colors (not
    including the alpha, or transparency, channel) for any single pixel. With some
    modes, the process of adding, subtracting, and so forth can produce values outside
    this range. In that case the mode either *clamps* (forces) the value back to the
    minimum value (0) or maximum value (255), or it wraps around to the other side
    of the range.'

    between paint modes and layer modes is that paint modes are applied as painting
    operations occur, so those changes are immediate and actually change the pixels
    in layers. Layer modes instruct GIMP how to combine a layer with the layers below
    it, but this compositing doesn’t actually change pixels. It only changes the way
    the canvas appears, as the layers are composited internally and displayed in the

    the *existing pixel* is the pixel (and its multiple color channels) in the current
    layer, while the *new pixel* is the one added by the paint tool. Operations performed
    on pixels affect each channel (red, green, and blue). When you study layer modes

    the existing pixel comes from the current layer and the new pixel comes from the

    create art nearly always involves experimenting, which often means abandoning
    one set of changes, going back to the source image, and trying something different.

    by blending the current layer with the pixels in the layers below it. The method
    of blending is the same as with paint modes, except that layer modes combine the
    pixel values as they’re displayed on the canvas, without changing pixels in the
    lower layers. For example, using the Bucket Fill tool to apply a pattern and then
    switching to Hard Light layer mode doesn’t change any of the pixels below the
    current layer. The current layer can therefore change in any way necessary—at
    any time—without losing pixel values for any other layer.

    G (green), or B (blue). According to this model, when R = 100, G = 100, and B
    = 100, you have dark gray. If you slide the triangle to the right, taking care
    to stay inside the graph, you still have a color model with three values at 100,
    but those values define a different color. To produce a particular color, you
    need both the color model and the color space.'

    the *sRGB (standard RGB)* color space using the RGB, Grayscale, and Indexed color
    models. The RGB model is used for displaying work on the monitor because it is
    an additive model in which components are added together to produce a color. The
    monitor starts with black (0/0/0), and as you increase the values of each component,
    the screen grows brighter. If the full amount of each component is added, you
    get white.

    and then mixing the color of the composited pixel with some percentage of the
    composited pixels beneath it in the layer stack. Transparency is also the opposite
    of opacity. If a pixel is 30 percent transparent, it’s also 70 percent opaque.

    a little more work. You may need to *feather* the selection. When creating a selection,
    GIMP offers the use of antialiasing. If antialiasing isn’t used, GIMP either includes
    a pixel or doesn’t include it in the selection; there are no partially selected
    pixels.

    process straddles this range on either side of the selection, one half outside
    the selection and the other half inside. The innermost edge of this range is fully
    opaque, while the outermost edge is fully transparent. As you move from the innermost

- en: GIMP is a raster image editor. Translated into plain English, that means it
    works great on photographs by changing the colors of individual pixels. It wasn’t
    initially designed for editing lines or geometric shapes as is a dedicated vector-graphics
    editor (such as Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape). Of course, vector editors don’t
    do as well dealing with pixels in photographs. But in today’s world, the line
    between raster image editors and vector editors is blurred, since graphics programs
    written for one type of editing often offer some level of support for the other.
    GIMP is no exception.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GIMP’s vector editing is handled with *paths*. A path consists of at least two
    points separated by a straight or curved line. The points are known as *anchors*,
    or sometimes as *control points*. The lines and their anchors are technically
    known as Bézier curves in honor of the French engineer who popularized their use
    in designing cars. The lines between anchors can be curved by dragging *handles*
    out from the anchors. Each anchor has two handles, each associated with either
    the line coming into or out of the anchor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Paths tool in the toolbox is the primary method of creating paths, though
    they can also be created by converting a selection to a path. The Tool Options
    dialog is used to set the editing mode for a path. Design mode is used to drop
    and position new anchors. The mouse cursor changes in the image window when positioned
    over an anchor or not. Edit mode allows adding new anchors between two existing
    anchors, splitting the line between them. Anchors can also be deleted using this
    mode, by holding down the SHIFT key. Move mode is used to move the entire path
    with all anchors at the same time.

    path will move. Second, all the anchors on each line are connected. Click any
    line and drag; you’ll see that the connected points move. Text can be converted
    into a path, but disconnected paths aren’t grouped when this is done. Notice that
    when you move some paths in an *e* or *a* that’s been converted to a path, the
    internal portions of those letters don’t move.

    often used to simulate lighting because they can represent gradual changes from
    dark to light. However, the appearance of a smooth gradient can be lost if you
    save it in the wrong file format. GIF files, for example, are not well suited
    for images with gradients, because the GIF format reduces the number of colors
    and can cause banding (streaks of colors). If you’re saving your gradient image
    for use on the Web, try using the JPEG format instead and use little to no compression.

    Digital cameras provide you with a simplified method of acquiring images for use
    in GIMP. You no longer need to worry about converting from film to digital files
    but instead can work with digital files directly. No more boxes of prints and
    negatives. The digital life is much easier.
  prefs: []

    using USB. Digital cameras use solid state devices (SSD) like flash memory cards.
    While scanners don’t know anything about the camera that took the image, digital
    images contain metadata to help with mapping colors from one device to another.
    There is new software to consider, as well as new issues with the files you load
    into GIMP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cameras today generate images that are GIMP ready by storing digital image files
    on a memory card. Many phones have integrated cameras that can produce high-quality
    images. To get these images on your computer, remove the card from the camera
    (don’t forget to charge the battery while you have your camera open) and insert
    it into an appropriate slot in your computer or USB card reader. On most computers,
    the card will be automatically detected, and an appropriate program for organizing
    your digital files will open. On Linux you can choose from Shot-well, F-Spot,
    digiKam, Darktable, and others. There are a many options available for Mac OS
    X and Windows users. Copy the files onto your hard disk using your own personal
    organizational method, such as one folder per day or one folder per event.

    about them. First and foremost: file formats. All digital cameras support JPEG-formatted
    files. Since it’s a lossy format, it’s not ideal for image-editing processes.
    JPEG images are compressed by an algorithm that takes human visual perception
    into account. It removes a lot of the details that you can’t see. For example,
    our eyes can’t differentiate among unlimited shades of blue in the sky, so the
    compression algorithm reduces these shades to a lower number. But when you later
    change the color of the sky in GIMP to get a more dramatic image, you’ll get bands
    of uniform color where a gradient should be.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to process your JPEG images in GIMP, you should set your camera
    to neutral colors, low compression (or larger file size), and low sharpening and
    noise reduction. Your images will look bland and boring out of camera, but these
    settings will provide you more options when editing in GIMP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some cameras support the TIFF format, a lossless format that can also be compressed.
    What’s the difference? A lossless format doesn’t lose any image information when
    compressed, so opening a compressed TIFF image will restore the original image.
    The same is not true of uncompressing a compressed JPEG image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But neither of these formats comes close to the image quality you get from the
    native file format for the camera. The general term for this format is RAW, but
    RAW formats are camera specific. They have file extensions like NEF, CR2, RAF,
    and more. Only high-end cameras are able to export the RAW file to memory cards.
    Consumer-grade cameras store it only in the camera’s memory until they have processed
    the image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since most cameras have low processing power, they use less sophisticated software
    to process from RAW to JPEG than tools for your desktop computer. This processing
    from RAW format may include destructive processes you’d rather apply manually,
    if at all. These may include effects like noise reduction, color correction, or
    sharpening. So working with RAW is generally considered the only way to go for
    professionals—even a “lossless” TIFF will have been processed by your camera.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, getting RAW images is not always easy. GIMP’s plug-in (UFRaw, itself
    based on the dcraw software) for processing these images doesn’t actually retrieve
    the images from the camera. Additionally, RAW files are larger than their JPEG
    or TIFF counterparts and generally require more memory and better processors.
    This is why the average desktop consumer might be better suited to using JPEG
    images, especially if your camera can set the amount of compression used on those
    photos. Again, JPEG is not completely ideal, but for lower-end consumer-grade
    cameras, it may be your only option without modifying your camera’s firmware.

    Clouds filter. The only difference between the two is that Difference Clouds applies
    Solid Noise to a new layer just above the active layer, changes the layer mode
    for the new one to Difference, and merges it with the active one.
