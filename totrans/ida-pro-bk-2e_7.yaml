- en: In December 2010, Hex-Rays released a significant upgrade to its free version
    of IDA, moving from version 4.9 to version 5.0\. The freeware version of IDA is
    a reduced-capability application that typically lags behind the latest available
    version of IDA by several generations and contains substantially fewer capabilities
    than the commercial equivalent of the same version. Thus, not only does the freeware
    version lack any features introduced in more recent versions of IDA, it also contains
    fewer capabilities than the commercial version of IDA version 5.0.

- en: The intent of this appendix is to provide an overview of the capabilities of
    IDA freeware and point out some of the differences in behavior that you may expect
    to encounter between the freeware version and the uses of IDA described throughout
    this book (which targets the latest commercial version of IDA). Before getting
    started, note that Hex-Rays also makes available a demo version of the latest
    commercial version of IDA that is reduced in functionality in many of the same
    ways as the freeware version, with the additional hindrance that it is not possible
    to save your work using a demo version of IDA. Also, the demo version will time
    out at random intervals, requiring that you restart it (without saving your work!)
    if you wish to resume the demonstration.

- en: The look and feel of IDA’s freeware version reflects the look and feel of all
    commercial versions. For the features that are present in the freeware version,
    the behaviors are similar, if not identical, to the behaviors described throughout
    the book regarding the commercial versions of IDA. Thus, IDA freeware is an excellent
    way to get acquainted with IDA prior to committing to a purchase. In noncommercial
    settings such as academic environments, IDA freeware offers an outstanding opportunity
    to learn the basics of disassembly and reverse engineering as long as the restriction
    to x86 is not a problem.

- en: For basic tasks involving x86 disassembly of common file types, IDA freeware
    may offer all the capabilities that you require. In particular, IDA 5.0 was the
    first version of IDA to incorporate an integrated, graph-based display mode. This
    feature alone represents a substantial upgrade over the previous version of freeware.
    It is when you find yourself with a need for some of IDA’s more advanced features
    that the freeware version begins to come up short. This is particularly true regarding
    the creation of FLIRT signatures and the creation and use of IDA plug-ins. The
    FLAIR utilities (see [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Library Recognition Using
    FLIRT Signatures")) and the IDA SDK (see [Chapter 16](ch16.html "Chapter 16. The
    IDA Software Development Kit")) are available only to registered users of commercial
    versions of IDA, making it difficult for freeware users to take advantage of these
    capabilities.

- en: If you are interested in FLIRT signatures, note that the freeware version is
    capable of processing signatures generated by the 4.9 and later versions of the
    FLAIR utilities (if you can get your hands on these utilities or have some-one
    generate the signatures for you). The SDK is a somewhat different matter. Even
    if you manage to locate a copy of version 5.0 of IDA’s SDK, plug-ins compiled
    with an unmodified version of the 5.0 SDK are not compatible with IDA freeware.
    This is because the freeware utilizes a completely different method of exporting
    functions from the core IDA libraries and so requires a different set of import
    libraries than are included in the SDK in order to link properly. This topic has
    been discussed for previous freeware versions (specifically IDA 4.9) in various
    reverse engineering forums.^([[244](#ftn.APP-A-FN-1)]) Previous solutions required
    a modified SDK, which was not easy to come by. At the time of this writing, there
    is no known publicly available means of compiling plug-ins for IDA 5.0 freeware.
    Therefore, users hoping to try out various well-known plug-ins (see [Chapter 23](ch23.html
    "Chapter 23. Real-World IDA Plug-ins")) may need to contact the authors of those
    plug-ins to see if they have any means of producing binary versions of their plug-ins
    that are compatible with IDA freeware.
