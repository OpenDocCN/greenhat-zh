<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis1"><a name="DHCP " class="calibre8" id="DHCP "/>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</span><a name="clients with" class="calibre8" id="clients with"/> provides network clients with an automated method of obtaining the configuration parameters necessary to communicate with other systems in an IP (Internet Protocol) based network. The parameters a DHCP server commonly provides to clients include IP address assignments, DNS server addresses, and default routers or gateway addresses.<a name="IDX-CHP-11-0182" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-11-0182"/><a name="IDX-CHP-11-0183" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-11-0183"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="first joins" class="calibre8" id="first joins"/>When a client system first joins a network using DHCP, it broadcasts a request to the local network for configuration information. The DHCP server then answers this request with the parameters set in the DHCP server configuration file. The client system applies this assigned configuration to its network interface in order to communicate with the network.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="assign IP" class="calibre8" id="assign IP"/>DHCP servers generally assign IP addresses in one of two ways: statically or dynamically. The <span class="docEmphasis1">static</span><a name="the client" class="calibre8" id="the client"/> method allocates an IP address to a client based on the client's hardware MAC (Media Access Control) address. This IP address will not change. A <span class="docEmphasis1">dynamic</span><a name="a leased" class="calibre8" id="a leased"/> IP address assignment is a leased address. The DHCP server assigns these addresses from a pool or range set by the administrator. Dynamic IP addresses are returned to the pool when a client disconnects from the network. If the same client rejoins the network, it may be assigned a different IP address if the previously assigned address is unavailable.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="replacement for" class="calibre8" id="replacement for"/>DHCP first appeared in October 1993 as a replacement for BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol). Version 1 of ISC's DHCP server was released by Ted Lemon in December 1997. ISC's DHCP implementation remains one of the most popular and robust open source DHCP solutions.</p>
