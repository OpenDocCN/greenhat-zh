    by the midline of the stroke, so with a semitransparent stroke you will see three
    distinct boundaries: the outer boundary of the stroke, the stroke’s midline where
    its fill starts, and the inner boundary of the stroke where it overlaps the fill.'

    is represented as a mix of red, green, and blue components, or *channels*. This
    model is implemented by nearly all computer displays (which are typically composed
    of tiny light sources of these three colors) and is the primary color model used
    in SVG as well as most other computer graphic formats.
  prefs: []

    in an RGB color may be either a fractional number between 0 and 1 (such as 0.5)
    or an integer between 0 and 255 (such as 127). These two systems are equivalent;
    for example, a color with R = 0, G = 0.5, B = 1.0 is the same as R = 0, G = 127,
    B = 255\. Inkscape normally uses the 0-to-255 integer format, which we will also
    prefer in this book. (However, in some parts of the Inkscape UI, you will see
    a choice to use either the integer or the fractional format.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In RGB, higher values of the channels make the color lighter and lower values
    make it darker. Thus, RGB 0/0/0 is black and RGB 255/255/255 is white. Any RGB
    color where the values of all channels are equal is a shade of gray; making the
    channels unequal adds saturation to the color, and the bigger the inequality,
    the greater the saturation. Thus, pure colors such as red (RGB 255/0/0) or yellow
    (RGB 255/255/0) have maximum possible saturation.

    input fields (with scroll buttons) or sliders that move within graduated-color

    change as you move the sliders; each groove shows you the the colors that you
    will get by moving the slider within it if the other sliders remain where they
    are. The fourth slider at the bottom, labeled **A** (alpha), represents the fill
    or stroke opacity (and thus is not, strictly speaking, part of the color).

- en: An RGB color is often expressed as a string of the form `RRGGBB` where each
    of the three components is given by a two-digit hexadecimal (base 16, instead
    of the conventional base 10) number. Hexadecimal numbers can use digits `0` through
    `9` and letters `A` through `F`. The maximum integer value of a channel—`255`
    in decimal—is represented as `FF` in hexadecimal. So, for example, `000000` is
    black, `FFFFFF` is white, `660000` is dark red. This form of representing colors
    is used in the SVG source of Inkscape documents, as well as in a lot of other
    software and languages (such as HTML). When you choose **Copy color** from the
    right-click menu of the fill or stroke swatch in the selected style indicator

    types in the selected stroke indicator (left) and the Fill and Stroke dialog (right)")),
    the `RRGGBB` representation of the color is copied to the clipboard. Also, a `RRGGBBAA`
    representation (with two more digits appended representing fill/stroke opacity)
    can be viewed and edited in the **RGBA** field in the **Fill and Stroke** dialog.

    *to the right* of that line, you *decrease* the corresponding color channel, down
    to the minimum at the lower edge of the window; by dragging it *above* or *to

    it still applies its color to vector objects, which behave as vector objects usually
    do. For example, if you want to change the tint of the face in your drawing, and
    if a hand in the drawing is part of the same path object as the face, that hand
    will change its tint too, even if it’s located far from the point you are painting.
    Still, even with this limitation, color painting allows you to quickly and intuitively
    make adjustments which would be awkward and slow with traditional vector tools.

    to assign some initial color to the clones—this will make them paintable with
    the Tweak tool without unlinking.

    or even for single objects. Unlike all other color selection methods, painting
    with the Tweak tool implements the *color mixing* metaphor, which is more natural
    for artists than RGB sliders or even the HSL color wheel. For example, start with
    a rectangle of pure blue color; then, pick different colors using Color Paint
    and apply light touches with minimum force and minimum pen pressure: Add a little
    green, a little brown, a little yellow, and so on until you have the exact mixed
    tint you need. Similarly, you can whiten or blacken any hue by adding white or
    black.'

    or color-jitter your entire drawing. Just select all in all layers (**[5.11 Selecting
    with Keyboard Shortcuts](ch05s11.html "5.11 Selecting with Keyboard Shortcuts")**),
    zoom out, choose a large brush width so it covers all of the drawing, and apply
    a little color tweaking (with minimum **Force**) that will therefore affect all
    visible objects.

    each with its own approach and capabilities. However, each of them has some downside.
    In particular, the **Fill and Stroke** dialog and the selected style indicator
    cannot edit many different colors without unifying them. The Tweak tool, on the
    other hand, which can adjust multiple colors at once, requires you to actually
    paint on canvas and can therefore be slow and imprecise for some tasks.

    "Chapter 17. Filters")), in particular the preset filters from the **Filters**
    ▸ **Color** submenu, or any others using the **Color Matrix** primitive. Compared
    to extensions, SVG filters are better in that they are nondestructive (the original
    look and color of an object is preserved and can be restored simply by removing
    the effect) and work on everything, including bitmaps and patterns. However, filters
    slow down rendering, and custom filters may be cumbersome to create.
