    and messages, connect to the Internet, and maybe play multiplayer games or listen
    to music and watch videos from a server. But once you have your home or small
    business network up and running, you can use the network to accomplish some things
    you might not have expected.

    of these is reason enough to install a network, but if you have come this far,
    you're already using the network for other purposes. Consider the network programs
    and services in this chapter as *lagniappe*, a little extra that might enhance
    your networking experience.

    you can keep two or more windows open at the same time without the need to bring
    one of them to the top, you can work more efficiently; just for starters, you
    can drag text, figures, or data from one document or program to another, view
    large documents and graphics without scrolling from one end of a document to the
    other, and keep a web browser or video surveillance window open on one screen
    while you work on the other. If you're writing code or working on a web page,
    you can save your work and immediately see what your latest changes look like
    in an application window or a browser. And in many Windows programs, you can drag

    screen as soon as the originator hits the Send button, rather than waiting for
    a mail server to forward each message. Assuming the distant computer is turned
    on and the messaging program is running, the text appears on the screen or the
    sender's voice comes through the computer's speakers immediately. Live messaging

    computers directly to each other, so you specify the name of the other participant
    rather then the channel. After you make the initial connection, there's not much

    to spam and other unwanted messages from strangers through the Internet. In addition,
    they don't use bandwidth between the LAN and the Internet, so they don't interfere
    with other activities, and they don't require a separate account for each user
    with an IM service (although the major IM services all offer free accounts). More
    importantly, a local messaging system controls all of your messages within the
    LAN, rather than sending everything to an outside service.

    are limited to a single operating system, whereas others offer compatible versions
    for exchanging messages between different computer types. In most cases, the same
    program must be running on each computer connected to the LAN; you can't assume
    that two different LAN messenger programs will automatically recognize each other.

    is typical of this category. As [Figure 16-7](ch16s04.html#lan_messenger_programs_list_the_names_o
    "Figure 16-7. LAN messenger programs list the names of available users.") shows,
    the program displays a list of people who are currently logged into their computers,
    with an icon that shows each person's status (Available, Busy, or Away). To send
    a message to another user, simply click that person's name and type your message
    in the pop-up Conversation window.

    "Figure 16-8. Both sides of a message exchange appear in the conversation window.").
    The same window appears on both the sender's and the recipient's computers. To

    your computer just like every other network node, even through you might be hundreds
    or thousands of miles away from the rest of the network. [Chapter 13](ch13.html
    "Chapter 13. NETWORK SECURITY") explains how to set up and use a VPN.

    The world's telephone companies spent many years and huge amounts of money trying
    to develop a successful commercial "picturephone" service as a supplement to traditional
    voice telephone calls, but it never happened until they repackaged it as "videoconferencing."
    Adding pictures to telephone service seemed like a good idea but it turned out
    to be too expensive and too intrusive to be practical for individual users. As
    a business proposition, call-based picturephones were a complete flop.

    to send and receive both still pictures and full-motion video through computer
    networks. As a result, many people have added online cameras (*webcams*) and microphones
    to their systems.

    "Figure 16-9. Windows Live Messenger can add video images to simple text.")) and
    Apple's iChat support video conversations in parallel with their text messaging
    services. They're both designed to operate through the Internet, but there's nothing
    to stop you from using them to conduct conversations with other people on your
    LAN.
