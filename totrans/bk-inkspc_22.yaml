    freehand drawing thanks to its wonderfully versatile Calligraphic pen tool (**[14.3
    The Calligraphic Pen Tool](ch14s03.html "14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool")**).
    Far from being geometrically perfect (and boring) like other vector tools, the
    Calligraphic pen has character—and it produces always-editable vector objects.

    entirely in Inkscape—let’s try drawing a funny, cartoon running horse which might
    be a mascot or a comic character. I’ve always found it challenging to draw anything
    from scratch (and I imagine many readers can sympathize). Yet with Inkscape, I
    was able to make a drawing that I actually liked.

    of 0.05 and a **Thinning** of 0.2 in the tool’s controls bar (**[14.3 The Calligraphic
    Pen Tool](ch14s03.html "14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool")**). If you have a graphics
    tablet, enable the pen pressure for varying the stroke width (**[14.3.1.1 Pressure
    Sensitivity](ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot1dot1_pressure_sensitivity "14.3.1.1 Pressure
    Sensitivity")**). The **Angle** and **Fixation** parameters only make sense for
    calligraphy, not freehand drawing, so we’ll set the **Fixation** to 0, which effectively
    turns a fixed-angle pen into a round brush that has no orientation (**[14.3.2
    Angle](ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot2_angle "14.3.2 Angle")**).

    obvious. With a beginning like this, I think many would be tempted, as I was,
    to give up right then and there. But patience and hard work pay off, especially
    in Inkscape. Just keep throwing strokes onto the canvas, undoing, tweaking, and
    throwing again. Sooner or later, something which is not entirely dreadful will
    flash through the tangle of bad lines.

    I found that photos of real horses were of little help to me. Much more inspirational
    were stylized *drawings* of horses, where other, more capable artists have already
    done the hard work of abstracting and amplifying the core equestrian visual features.
    A Google image search will provide you with plenty of reference material. After
    much sketching, undoing, and emphasizing (by adding pen pressure), I arrived at

    (typically with a pencil) and *inking* (with a pen) over the rough sketch. You
    can follow the same process in Inkscape. Now that the drawing looks more or less
    like a horse, it is time to start inking *over* it to develop it further. This
    way, you can see what was good in the original sketch and try to build on that
    without the risk of destroying it with too much tweaking. Select all strokes (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735370.png.jpg))
    and assign them an opacity of 0.05 so they become barely visible; this effectively
    hides the thin strokes, making it easier to concentrate on the bold ones. Then,
    lock this layer (using the lock toggle button in the status bar), create a new
    one (**Layer** ▸ **Add Layer**), and draw the same horse *again*, using the sketch

    the head (especially the eyes) and the legs (or hands, or paws) of your creature.
    In the first inking layer, let’s do just that: Keep the body the same but enlarge

- en: Now that the outline is almost done, it’s time to start thinking about coloring
    the drawing. Inkscape can emulate many different styles of coloring. For example,
    you can imitate a painting by overlying many random calligraphic strokes and painting
    each one with a different color and opacity (you can use the Tweak tool for that,
    **[8.7.1 Color Paint](ch08s07.html#eightdot7dot1_color_paint "8.7.1 Color Paint")**).
    Let’s try a more traditional, smooth coloring, consisting of a flat color fill
    with some lighting and shading (white and black ellipses with elliptic opacity
    gradients, **[10.1.2 Elliptic Gradients](ch10s01.html#one0dot1dot2_elliptic_gradients
    "10.1.2 Elliptic Gradients")**). Use the Paint bucket tool (**[14.4 The Paint
    Bucket Tool](ch14s04.html "14.4 The Paint Bucket Tool")**) to create the interior
    shape; you can apply a little blur to it (about 2 percent) for extra smoothness
    ([Figure 22-7](ch22s04.html#coloring_options "Figure 22-7. Coloring options")).

- en: Let’s get back to our outline (hide the coloring layer for now). It can be made
    much smoother and more attractive if you select all the strokes of some part of
    the figure (such as a leg or the head), union them (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735892.png.jpg)),
    and simplify the result by pressing ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg)
    a few times. This melts the sharp corners and welds the joints for a much more
    natural and integral look. Another very useful trick is making all strokes thicker
    by outsetting them (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736456.png.jpg))
    or thinner by insetting (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735928.png.jpg),
    **[12.4 Offsetting](ch12s04.html "12.4 Offsetting")**). Multiple insets and outsets
    on a path have an effect similar to simplification. Too much insetting may make
    some parts of a stroke disappear altogether, but this is not necessarily bad—trust
    the overall impression and your artistic sense. Of course, the Node tool (**[12.5
    The Node Tool](ch12s05.html "12.5 The Node Tool")**) can also be used for manual
    editing of strokes.

    Striking the right balance between regularity and chaos, between tidiness and
    untidiness is critical for the impression that your character will make. At this
    stage, the tail and especially the mane of my horse weren’t impressive—I drew
    them over and over many times, but all my attempts looked either too lumpy or
    too bushy (or both). I was finally able to produce a decent wavy hair by using
    a high value of **Tremor** (**[14.3.4 Tremor, Wiggle, and Mass](ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot4_tremorcomma_wigglecomma_and
    "14.3.4 Tremor, Wiggle, and Mass")**) in the Calligraphic pen, as shown in [Figure 22-9](ch22s05.html#drawing_hair
    "Figure 22-9. Drawing hair"). Maximizing this parameter makes the calligraphic
    brush strokes nicely blotchy and much more uniformly uneven than I was able to
    make them manually.

    can sometimes improve it significantly without much work. Overall, the result
    turned out much better than I expected, and I’m pretty sure I would never be able
    to achieve this level of quality by drawing on paper. Of course, this is not the
    only style of drawing that you can do in Inkscape; experiment to find the techniques
    that are most natural for you. I have grown to especially like the Calligraphic
    pen with a high **Tremor** value, which gives you an almost “natural media” drawing
    tool.
