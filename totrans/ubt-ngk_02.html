Better yet is the fact that, unlike earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don't need an additional installation CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu Desktop CD functions as both a live CD and an install CD. And in the good-better-best swing of things, the best point of all is that installation from the live CD is actually much, much easier than any other installation process you've ever dealt with, and it even gives you more than one way to go about it.</p><p>In this chapter, I will cover the basics of starting up and running Ubuntu from the live CD and then, assuming you've caught the Linux bug, the painless steps of installing Ubuntu on your hard disk as your sole operating system, in its own partition on your hard disk in a traditional dual-boot setup (with Windows in its own partition), or, for the slightly less adventurous, from within your Windows system. If your computer doesn't have a CD drive, don't worry, you can still join in—take a look at <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. INSTALLING UBUNTU FROM A USB FLASH DRIVE">Appendix A</a> to see how you can run or install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive instead. Whatever way you end up going about things, let's put this book to use and get Ubuntu up and running.</p><div class="sect1" title="Going for a Dip"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="going_for_a_dip"/>Going for a Dip</h1></div></div></div><p>To get a taste of what Ubuntu is all about (and to check out your hardware to see whether it's all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way to go than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the Ubuntu Desktop CD in your disc drive and restart your machine. When the machine starts up, it should boot up from the CD, and after a second or two, you should see a purple Ubuntu startup screen with a couple of icons at the bottom of it. If the screen does not appear and your machine instead boots up into your usual operating system, then it is very likely that your machine's BIOS settings need to be changed to allow you to boot from a CD.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0075" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0079" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0080" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0081" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0082" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0083" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0084" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0085" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0086" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can access your machine's BIOS by restarting and then pressing whatever key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS setup. This is usually <span class="keycap"><strong>delete</strong></span> or F1 (F2, F10, and <span class="keycap"><strong>esc</strong></span> are also common), but not all machines are the same. If the onscreen information passes by so fast that you miss it, you can check your user's manual to see what the correct key is. Once you get into the BIOS setup, change the boot sequence so that your CD drive is first.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0087" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Once your machine boots from the live CD and you see the purple Ubuntu startup screen, either you can wait for a few seconds for Ubuntu to start booting into the live CD proper or you can press a key (any key) to display a menu where you can choose your language and other settings. The default settings should suffice for our purposes, so leave the keyboard untouched for a few seconds, and the purple screen will give way to a loading screen (also purple).</p><p>After a couple of minutes or so, the loading screen will disappear, and in its place will come an Install window like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#the_ubuntu_live_cd_apostrophy_s_install" title="Figure 2-1. The Ubuntu live CD's Install window">Figure 2-1</a>. You should now be able to use your mouse as well as the keyboard, so unless you want to change the language using the list on the left of the screen, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Try Ubuntu 10.04</strong></span> button to start a live session. After a few more seconds of loading, you'll be presented with an Ubuntu desktop, all run from the CD. And remember, your hard disk will go untouched, so rest easy—you're not going to change, let alone hurt, anything. When you get to this point, you're ready to roll—but I'll hold off on talking about that until <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A NEW PLACE TO CALL HOME">Chapter 3</a>.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Special input mechanisms that are required for typing certain languages (that is, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are not supported in live CD sessions.</p></div><p>If you'd like to get out of the live CD and return your computer to normal, click the power button at the top right of the screen, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span>, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span> again from the window that appears. After a little while, you'll be asked to remove the CD from the drive and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The computer will restart and return you to your normal Windows desktop soon after. If you have no luck with the Restart button for some reason, it should be safe to just turn your computer off and then on again using the power button on the front of it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_ubuntu_live_cd_apostrophy_s_install"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1426"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656096.png.jpg" alt="The Ubuntu live CD's Install window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-1. The Ubuntu live CD's Install window</p></div></div></div>

If, however, you haven't installed Ubuntu yet and are ready and rarin' to do so, then you had better stay right where you are and continue reading.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0088" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0089" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0090" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0091" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Going for a Swim—Installing Ubuntu Inside Windows (the Wubi Installer)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="going_for_a_swimminstalling_ubuntu_insid"/>Going for a Swim—Installing Ubuntu Inside Windows (the Wubi Installer)</h2></div></div></div><p>It used to be that if you enjoyed Ubuntu enough to want to run it off your hard disk but were afraid to do it for fear of damaging the delicate state of your Windows setup, you were . . . well, out of luck. Things have changed, however, because there is now an installation option called <span class="emphasis"><em>Wubi</em></span> that lets you install Ubuntu directly on your Windows C: drive as if it were any other Windows program. Once installed, every time you start up your machine, you will be able to choose between starting up into Windows or into Ubuntu from the Windows bootloader screen. Your Windows system stays as it is; you don't have to partition your hard disk; and if you want to get rid of Ubuntu later for whatever reason, you can do so like you would with any other Windows application. It's a great way to go about things for the faint of heart.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0093" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0092" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Admittedly, this approach could be described as a half measure, in that it doesn't really give you the full experience you would normally get from a dedicated Ubuntu installation. It also takes longer to install, because Wubi needs to download the installation files from the Internet (the right ones aren't on the CD). But it is a pretty good compromise—it definitely runs quicker and is much, much more usable and enjoyable than an Ubuntu live CD session. You also have the added benefit of being able to save files and settings to disk, which means you can follow along with anything described in this book. Pretty cool.</p><p>If this alternative installation approach doesn't seem appealing to you, move on to <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#taking_the_full_plungeminstalling_ubuntu" title="Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows">Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html" title="About the Penguin">About the Penguin</a>.

If, on the other hand, you've decided that the Wubi installer is the answer to your prayers, here's what you need to do: Insert the Ubuntu live CD that comes with this book into your computer's disc drive while Windows is up and running. A window like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#an_ubuntu_live_cd_automatically_launched" title="Figure 2-2. An Ubuntu live CD automatically launched in Windows">Figure 2-2</a> will automatically appear.</p><div class="figure"><a id="an_ubuntu_live_cd_automatically_launched"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1490"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656098.png.jpg" alt="An Ubuntu live CD automatically launched in Windows"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-2. An Ubuntu live CD automatically launched in Windows</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install inside Windows</strong></span> button.

This is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>dual-boot setup</em></span>. It has also become incredibly easy to set up such a system. I started out with a dual-boot setup, though I eventually found that I used the Linux side of things exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I didn't use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped the whole thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup.</p><p>My feeling is that you should try the Wubi route of installing Ubuntu inside Windows first and then, when you're ready, go for a Linux-only setup and ditch Windows completely. Most people find that Ubuntu can do everything they need, so there's no need to dual-boot unless you require some specific application that has no equivalent on Linux.</p><p>If you do opt for a dual-boot setup, starting up in either system is easy. When you start up your machine, you will be greeted by the GRand Unified Bootloader (better known as GRUB) screen, from which you can choose to continue booting up Linux or choose Windows instead. After that, bootup proceeds as normal for the system you selected. This setup works fine and is easy to use, so you needn't worry.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0104" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So as you see, either way you decide to go, you can't really go wrong. Just be sure to back up your important files before starting the installation. Proceed with common sense, patience, and a positive attitude, and you'll be fine. In short, don't worry.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Ready for Action"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_ready_for_action"/>Getting Ready for Action</h2></div></div></div><p>There is less you need to do to prepare for an Ubuntu installation than for many other Linux distributions. Once you've decided whether you want to go the dual-boot route, all you really need to have on hand is your single Ubuntu Desktop CD and, for guidance and security, this book. The only mental energy you'll probably need to expend is to come up with a username and user password, just as you do for most other operating systems.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0105" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0106" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0107" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect3" title="Usernames and User Passwords"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="usernames_and_user_passwords"/>Usernames and User Passwords</h3></div></div></div><p>Your username is something that you will be seeing quite a bit. You will need to click it every time you boot up your system, among other things, so be sure it is something you can live with. It can be just your first name or your initials or whatever you want it to be. It must, however, begin with a lowercase letter, followed by numbers and/or other lowercase letters. Mine, for example, is simply <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>, but you could use something like <span class="emphasis"><em>hope4u2pal</em></span>, though that would get rather tiring to look at.</p><p>You also need to come up with a user password, which you will need to type every time you log in. You will need to use it when you install new software or change certain system settings, as well. It should be a minimum of eight characters in length and consist of numbers and letters (upper- and lowercase) for improved security. You can, of course, get by with fewer characters and only letters if you prefer. The installer will advise you if the password you enter is unacceptable, so don't worry too much. Be sure to write it down and keep the paper you've written it on in a safe place so you don't end up locking yourself out of your system.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you have experience working with other Linux distributions, you may be surprised to learn that the root account is disabled by default in Ubuntu. There is, therefore, no installation step for inputting a root password. You can check the forums (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) to learn ways of getting around this setup. You can also set up a root password later at any time after the system is installed, so if having a root account is important to you, don't worry.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0108" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Dual-Booters Take Note"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="dual-booters_take_note"/>Dual-Booters Take Note</h3></div></div></div><p>If you are going to be creating a dual-boot setup, it is a good idea to first defragment your current Windows disk before moving on to installing Ubuntu. This step isn't strictly necessary, but it can make the repartitioning phase of the installation process a little faster, and it helps guard against unwanted surprises.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0109" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0110" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-2-0111" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, your system is set up by default to automatically defragment your hard disk on a regular basis, so you should be good to go without any additional effort on your part. On other versions of Windows, however, you'll have to defragment your disk manually. In Windows XP, you can do this by double-clicking <span class="strong"><strong>My Computer</strong></span>, right-clicking the icon for your hard disk, and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>. You can then defragment your hard disk by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> tab in the Properties window and clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Defragment Now</strong></span> button. In Windows 2000, you can do this by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Control Panel</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administrative Tools</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Computer Management</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong></span>, while in Windows 98 and some other versions, you can do the same by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Programs</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>System Tools</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong></span>.

Nothing hard about that, eh?</p><p>Of course, when you look at the directions and descriptions listed here, it may look like a long and cumbersome process. It is not. It will be over more quickly than you can imagine. As a beginner frequently referring to this text, you might take a bit longer, of course, but all in all, the whole process is faster and easier than that for Windows or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that with Windows and OS X you are installing the operating system with just a few bundled applications. In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, you are installing not only the operating system itself but also most of the applications you will ever want or need to use. You will thus be getting a lot done in one fell swoop.</p><p>One more thing before we start. Some people approach installing a system with a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as if the house is going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing somewhere along the line. Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as you have backed up your data, you will be OK. If you screw up the installation the first time out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, because you have nothing to harm. Just make sure that you give yourself more time than you need for the process. Don't start installing one hour before you have to be at work or before you have to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes people do weird things. Make things easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty of time and, as I mentioned before, by backing up any data you would mourn the loss of.</p><p>If you're ready, here are the steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Start 'er up</strong></span>.

Once done, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Forward</strong></span> button.</p><p>If you have no operating system on your hard disk or if you intend to eliminate what you currently have and replace it with Ubuntu, you should instead choose the second option, <span class="strong"><strong>Erase and use the entire disk</strong></span>; then, if given a choice, select the main drive onto which you want to install the system.</p><div class="figure"><a id="partitioning_your_hard_disk_open_parenth"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1962"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656108.png.jpg" alt="Partitioning your hard disk (or not) to make way for Ubuntu"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-7. Partitioning your hard disk (or not) to make way for Ubuntu</p></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="what_is_a_hard_drive_partition_question"/><p class="title">WHAT IS A HARD DRIVE PARTITION?</p><p>I've mentioned <span class="emphasis"><em>partitions</em></span> several times so far, but it may not be obvious to you what I meant. A partition is an area of your hard disk that is "cordoned off" from other areas of the disk. It's a useful way of keeping things such as operating systems separate. Because they are isolated from each other, different partitions are treated as if they are different hard disks attached to your computer, even though they're on the same physical hard disk.</p><p>Most computers have just one partition that fills up the entire hard disk. This is like having a house with a completely open floor plan—the whole house is just one big room. If you want to completely remove Windows and install Ubuntu instead, Ubuntu can happily take over the entire partition (and thus the entire disk) and kick out its former resident, Windows.</p><p>If you want to install two operating systems on the same computer, you have to give each one its own partition (after all, they need their privacy). Back with the house analogy, it's like erecting a partition wall to carve up the house into two rooms. If you choose to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, the installer will automatically do this partitioning for you. Of course, you can choose how big each partition is: The bigger you make the Ubuntu partition, the more disk space will be available to you in Ubuntu (and the less in Windows). After all, the house is the same size; it's just the position of the dividing wall that you're changing.<a id="IDX-CHP-2-0135" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can find some information on manually partitioning your hard disk in <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. MANUALLY PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK">Appendix C</a>, if you fancy taking control of the process yourself. There should be no need to, however, since the Ubuntu installer will be happy to handle the task for you.</p></div><p>If you'd like to do something more elaborate with your disk space, such as having separate partitions for your data and system files (convenient if you ever need to reinstall or want to easily share files between Windows and Ubuntu), you'll need to specify the partitions manually using the last option. This is more advanced—check out <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. MANUALLY PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK">Appendix C</a> for some guidance. Once your selection is made, click <span class="strong"><strong>Forward</strong></span>.</p><p>Depending on the partitioning scheme you chose, once you've clicked the Forward button, a small window may appear reminding you that any changes you've made thus far will now be written to disk (<a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#a_warning_that_the_changes_you_apostroph" title="Figure 2-8. A warning that the changes you've requested are about to be made permanent">Figure 2-8</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_warning_that_the_changes_you_apostroph"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e2002"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656110.png.jpg" alt="A warning that the changes you've requested are about to be made permanent"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-8. A warning that the changes you've requested are about to be made permanent</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> button, keeping in mind that, if you saw the warning message, this is the point of no return.
