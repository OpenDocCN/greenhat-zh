    primary OSI model network layer (layer 3) protocol that provides addressing, datagram
    routing, and other functions in an internetwork. The *Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP)* is the primary transport layer (layer 4) protocol and is responsible for

    to use a number of protocols that had been adapted from existing technologies.

    layer, IP provides functions such as addressing, delivery, datagram packaging,
    fragmentation, and reassembly. At the transport layer, TCP and UDP are concerned

    information. The server then responds with a reply to the client, giving the client
    what it requested, or else it replies with an alternative response, such as an
    error message or information about where else it might find the data. Most (but

    software (usually called a *browser*) sends requests to a web server. The web
    server then responds with the requested content. (There's more to it than that,
    of course, but that's how it appears to the user.) Among other things, the web

- en: On many TCP/IP networks, there is no TCP/IP protocol running at all on this
    layer, because it is simply not needed. For example, if you run TCP/IP over Ethernet,
    then Ethernet handles layer 2 (and layer 1) functions. However, the TCP/IP standards
    do define protocols for TCP/IP networks that do not have their own layer 2 implementation.
    These protocols, the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and the Point-to-Point
    Protocol (PPP), fill the gap between the network layer and the physical layer.
    They are commonly used to facilitate TCP/IP over direct serial line connections
    (such as dial-up telephone networking) and other technologies that operate directly
    at the physical layer.

- en: The Internet layer corresponds to the network layer in the OSI Reference Model
    (thus it is sometimes called the *network layer* even in TCP/IP model discussions).
    It is responsible for typical layer 3 jobs, such as logical device addressing,
    data packaging, manipulation and delivery, and routing. At this layer, you find
    IP, which is arguably the heart of TCP/IP, as well as support protocols such as
    the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and the routing protocols (RIP, OSFP,
    BGP, and so on). IP version 6, the next-generation IP, is also at this layer.

    communication over an internetwork. It is in charge of allowing logical connections
    to be made between devices that allow data to be sent either unreliably (with
    no guarantee that it gets there) or reliably (where the protocol keeps track of
    the data sent and received in order to make sure it arrives, and resends it if
    necessary). It is also here that identification of the specific source and destination
    application process is accomplished.

    The key TCP/IP protocols at this layer are TCP and UDP. The TCP/IP transport layer
    corresponds to the layer of the same name in the OSI model (layer 4) but includes
    certain elements that are arguably part of the OSI session layer. For example,
    TCP establishes a connection that can persist for a long period of time, which
    some people say makes a TCP connection more like a session.

    broad layer, encompassing layers 5 through 7 in the OSI model. While this seems
    to represent a loss of detail compared to the OSI model, that's probably a good
    thing. The TCP/IP model better reflects the somewhat fuzzy nature of the divisions
    between the functions of the higher layers in the OSI model, which in practical
    terms often seem rather arbitrary. It really is hard to separate some protocols
    in terms of which portions of layers 5, 6, or 7 they encompass.

    in terms of a layered reference model called the *TCP/IP model, DARPA model*,
    or *DoD model*. The TCP/IP model includes four layers: the *network interface
    layer* (responsible for interfacing the suite to the physical hardware on which
    it runs), the *Internet layer* (where device addressing, basic datagram communication,
    and routing take place), the *host-to-host transport layer* (where connections
    are managed and reliable communication is ensured), and the *application layer*
    (where end-user applications and services reside). The first three layers correspond
    to layers 2 through 4 of the OSI Reference Model respectively; the application
    layer is equivalent to OSI layers 5 to 7.'

    protocols that compose it. Each protocol resides in a particular layer of the
    TCP/IP architectural model that I just discussed and is charged with performing
    a certain subset of the total functionality required to implement a TCP/IP network
