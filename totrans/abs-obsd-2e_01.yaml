    and have each serve as the terminal for the others’ console. (We’ll cover serial
    consoles in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The Boot Process").) From reading
    the manual page (discussed in the next section), this common configuration seemed
    simple enough: Attach the cables, configure one machine to dump its console to
    the serial port, become root on the display machine, and enter **`tip tty00`**.

  zh: 许多高级OpenBSD用户使用基于文本的电子邮件阅读器，如Mutt（尽管相当多的人确实使用更图形化的电子邮件阅读器。）基于文本的电子邮件程序是处理每天成千上万封电子邮件的强大程序，但它们只显示文本，并且不很好地显示HTML消息。如果你使用的是图形邮件客户端，如Mozilla
    Thunderbird或Microsoft Outlook，请将文本包裹在72列宽。发送纯HTML或没有可读行包裹的邮件会邀请经验丰富的收件人将其丢弃而不阅读。
- en: This might seem harsh, and it’s definitely different from mailing lists run
    by other open source operating systems. But most email clients are not suited
    to handle thousands of messages in a day, scattered across dozens of mailing lists,
    with several parallel discussion threads each, in a manner accessible to the human
    mind. I receive thousands of email messages a day, and I know many OpenBSD developers
    get—and process—even more. We simply cannot cope without mail tools that address
    our problems. HTML support is not nearly as necessary as the ability to manage,
    present, and process a large number of messages in a sensible manner.

  zh: 这可能看起来很严厉，而且确实与其他开源操作系统的邮件列表管理方式不同。但大多数电子邮件客户端并不适合处理每天成千上万条消息，这些消息分散在几十个邮件列表中，每个列表中都有几个并行的讨论线程，以人类思维可接受的方式。我每天都会收到成千上万封电子邮件，我知道许多OpenBSD开发者接收并处理的消息甚至更多。我们无法在没有解决我们问题的邮件工具的情况下应对。HTML支持远不如以合理的方式管理、展示和处理大量消息的能力重要。
- en: On a similar note, most email attachments are unnecessary (and several of the
    OpenBSD mailing lists will unceremoniously strip them from incoming messages).
    You do not need to PGP sign your email, and those business card attachments just
    demonstrate that you really shouldn’t be running OpenBSD. If you include a signature
    in your email, it should be no longer than four lines. Long ASCII art signatures,
    even really nifty ones featuring the OpenBSD blowfish, are right out.

    assistance. Remember to be polite; the people who receive your message might decide
    to help you, but they’re under no obligation to do so. If you want someone to
    be obliged to help you, buy a support contract.

    about the OpenBSD core system to *misc@OpenBSD.org*. Yes, OpenBSD has many other
    mailing lists, and some of them might look more appropriate for your problem,
    but people who post to them are almost always told to go ask on *misc@* instead.
    People on *misc@* might refer you to another mailing list, but it’s much better
    to post a message to a specific list if that message starts with “So-and-so on
    *misc@* recommended that I ask this here.” If you have a narrow, specific, well-documented
    question about a piece of add-on software (or package, as discussed in [Chapter 13](ch13.html
    "Chapter 13. Software Management")), you can send it to *ports@OpenBSD.org* instead.

    words “man such-and-such.” If that’s what you get, that’s where you need to go.
    Remember that you’re asking because you don’t understand something, and these

    back asking someone to hold your hand.
