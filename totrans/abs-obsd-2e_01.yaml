    structure a little surprising. There is no toll-free number to call and no vendor
    to guide you. No, you may not speak to the manager of the support team. There
    isn’t one. The management is you.

    access you get is through the programs, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and application binary interfaces (ABIs) they provide. If you want to learn more
    about how your operating system works, you can’t (unless you reverse-engineer
    it). When something breaks, you either live with it or pay the vendor to solve
    the problem.

    the compiler, and the resulting binaries. You have the official manual and a whole
    bunch of ancillary documentation. You have access to the developers’ logs—logs
    that describe every change ever made to every part of the system—through the same
    tools the developers use. You can back out of changes, understand the motivation
    behind the changes, and even contact the people who have most recently worked
    on a component you’re interested in and ask them what they were thinking. You
    can add your own features. In other words, you have the opportunity to understand
    OpenBSD in exquisite, excruciating detail.

    identify bugs, you must learn how the system should behave and why.

    an OpenBSD machine to display a serial console. All of my Unix-like boxes had
    connections to a rusty old terminal server. Most people don’t have that many serial
    consoles, and they want to use a null modem cable between two OpenBSD machines
    and have each serve as the terminal for the others’ console. (We’ll cover serial
    consoles in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The Boot Process").) From reading
    the manual page (discussed in the next section), this common configuration seemed
    simple enough: Attach the cables, configure one machine to dump its console to
    the serial port, become root on the display machine, and enter **`tip tty00`**.

    read articles on third-party websites, the FAQ, and this book. If you find a tutorial

    a link to Crypto. This takes you to the Cryptography page, which covers OpenBSD’s
    cryptography support. It includes algorithms and discusses how the team has integrated
    OpenSSL into hardware cryptographic accelerators. Read, learn, and enjoy.

    section 4 should jump out at you, but start wherever you feel most comfortable.

    On the day I wrote this, the first result led me to the official page on the OpenBSD
    website. The second hit was a paper on the OpenBSD cryptographic framework. You’ll
    find old articles, archived mailing list discussions, man pages, tutorials, and
    innumerable blog posts. You’ll probably need to add the model number of a particular
    cryptographic accelerator card to reduce the results to a manageable number.

    the integrated manual, and other assorted resources do not answer your question,
    you can ask for help. A variety of highly knowledgeable and very skilled computing
    professionals read the OpenBSD mailing lists. Many of these people enjoy working
    with OpenBSD and want to help intelligent new users. In their minds, “intelligent”

    lists might give you a bit of a culture shock. OpenBSD users are advanced computer
    users almost by definition. If an experienced systems administrator tries to debug
    a piece of software, that administrator is expected to know enough to ask the
    responsible party. If you go to a Linux forum, you’ll find people discussing server
    and client programs, desktop environments, and dang near any other piece of software
    that runs on that platform. Those forums are manned by volunteers dedicated to
    providing around-the-clock support and extreme efforts to help their operating
    system conquer the world.

    really care if you use their software. If other people can get use out of it,
    that’s great. If not, oh well. They will happily assist you with OpenBSD-specific
    problems, but they don’t really care about your database issues or your website.
    If you’re having trouble porting your preferred window manager to OpenBSD because
    of some subtle bug in OpenBSD’s `libc`, the OpenBSD people would love to talk
    to you. If you can’t configure your window manager the way you like, then you
    should talk to the window manager support group instead.

    solve. What question should you actually be asking? Define the issue as narrowly
    as possible. Suppose you cannot connect to a virtual private network (VPN) server
    with OpenBSD’s IPsec client. Is the problem that you can’t actually reach the
    IPsec server? Does the connection work when you turn off your OpenBSD firewall,
    but return when you re-enable filtering? Does `isakmpd(8)` crash and leave a core
    file every time you try to start the VPN? Each of these is a very different problem.
    Including the precise problem in your email will get you a better reception.

    quite a few do use more graphic email readers, mind you.) Text-based email programs
    are very powerful programs for handling thousands of emails a day, but they show
    only text, and they do not display HTML messages well. If you are using a graphic
    mail client such as Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook, wrap your text at
    72 columns. Sending mail in pure HTML or without readable line wrapping invites
    experienced recipients to discard it unread.

- en: This might seem harsh, and it’s definitely different from mailing lists run
    by other open source operating systems. But most email clients are not suited
    to handle thousands of messages in a day, scattered across dozens of mailing lists,
    with several parallel discussion threads each, in a manner accessible to the human
    mind. I receive thousands of email messages a day, and I know many OpenBSD developers
    get—and process—even more. We simply cannot cope without mail tools that address
    our problems. HTML support is not nearly as necessary as the ability to manage,
    present, and process a large number of messages in a sensible manner.

    OpenBSD mailing lists will unceremoniously strip them from incoming messages).
    You do not need to PGP sign your email, and those business card attachments just
    demonstrate that you really shouldn’t be running OpenBSD. If you include a signature
    in your email, it should be no longer than four lines. Long ASCII art signatures,
    even really nifty ones featuring the OpenBSD blowfish, are right out.

    be obliged to help you, buy a support contract.

    People on *misc@* might refer you to another mailing list, but it’s much better
    to post a message to a specific list if that message starts with “So-and-so on
    *misc@* recommended that I ask this here.” If you have a narrow, specific, well-documented
    question about a piece of add-on software (or package, as discussed in [Chapter 13](ch13.html
