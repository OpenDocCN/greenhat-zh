- en: A programmer I know thought he'd figured out how never to get a parking ticket.
    His three choices for personalized license plates were 1) 0O0O0O, 2) O0O0O0, and
    3) I1I1I1\. He figured that if a policeman did spot the car, the letter "O" and
    digit "0" look so much alike that it would be next to impossible to copy down
    the license plate correctly.

    confused and he wound up with a plate reading "OOOOOO."
