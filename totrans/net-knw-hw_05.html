But it's almost always better to spend some time planning your network before you start to install it. It's a lot easier to make changes to your design on paper rather than making adds, moves, and changes in physical space. This chapter offers advice and instructions for preparing a network plan.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0445"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0446"/></p><p>I'm assuming in this chapter that you have chosen not to use either power line or video cable as your primary network distribution medium. Both of those methods can be practical in some situations, but a traditional Ethernet system, possibly with a supplementary Wi-Fi base station, is usually a better choice for a small business or household network, because the equipment is widely available, it's often inexpensive, and it's easy to install and maintain.</p><p>To begin your network plan, start with a floor plan of the house, apartment, or workspace where you want to install your network. The plan doesn't have to be exactly to scale, but it should be big enough to add notes within each room or cubicle, and it should show the relative positions of each room. <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#use_a_floor_plan_to_identify_locations" title="Figure 5-1. Use a floor plan to identify locations for network connection points.">Figure 5-1</a> shows a typical floor plan for a small one-story house.

Before you start to add new network wiring and connection points, you must understand how they will relate to the other things in each room. If you're planning a network as part of a major remodeling or new construction, plan to coordinate your efforts with the contractors or outside installers who will provide electrical wiring, telephones, cable or satellite TV, and wiring for a home theater or home entertainment system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0476"/></p><p>With all this information in one place, it's easy to decide where you will want to install network connection points. Use yet another color of pencil to mark an unobstructed place for the network outlet on the wall nearest to each computer and every other device you plan to connect to the network.</p><p>Each outlet should be at least a foot from the closest electrical outlet, both because AC wiring can generate interference that affects data signals, and because it's often required by the local electric code to prevent shorting between AC and data cables.</p><p>If your telephone or cable TV outlets are mounted on wall plates (rather than in small boxes attached to the baseboard), consider replacing the existing wall plate with a new one that combines two or three outlets of different types on a single wall plate, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#this_wall_plate_combines_tv_and_data_ne" title="Figure 5-2. This wall plate combines TV and data network outlets.">Figure 5-2</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0477"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0478"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0479"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0480"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0481"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0482"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0483"/></p><p>When you design your network, you should also plan for the future. You probably don't need them today, but within a few years, it's quite possible that you will want to connect your household appliances, a bedside radio, and other devices to your LAN and the Internet. And if you plan to eventually add one or more online cameras or home automation devices (such as lighting or climate controls) to the network, it's a good idea to mark their tentative locations.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0484"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="this_wall_plate_combines_tv_and_data_ne"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e3991"/><img alt="This wall plate combines TV and data network outlets." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266244.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 5-2. This wall plate combines TV and data network outlets.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Remember, it doesn't cost anything to mark a location for an outlet on your floor plan. You don't have to install every outlet right away, but it's helpful to know where they're likely to be when you plan your cable runs. You can always change the exact locations before you actually pull cable through the walls.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Planning for a lot of extra network connection points might seem unnecessary right now, but that will almost certainly change. If you plan for more network connection points than you think you need today, you might have enough for the next ten years. Consider this: If you live in an old house with the original electrical wiring, you probably know that one or two AC outlets in each room was considered more than enough back in 1925; more would have been extravagant. Today, you should have several electrical outlet plates on every wall. In the future, household data networks will be as common as electricity and telephones.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0485"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0486"/></p></div><p>In your home, consider placing at least one network outlet in each major room—don't worry about hallways and other odd spaces. In the kitchen, place one outlet close to a counter, and plan to place another on the wall next to the refrigerator and range. You might also want an outlet in the laundry room, not far from the washer and dryer—you probably won't want to connect your appliances to the network right now, but remote control and monitoring through your home network is a real possibility in the future. In each bedroom, plan for an outlet near a desk or table where the room's occupant uses a computer or video game console, and (if it's not close to the first outlet) another outlet for a bedside Internet radio or a laptop computer.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0487"/></p><p>In an office, plan for at least one network connection point next to every desk and every other location where you expect to place a computer or other network device, such as a printer.</p><p>If you expect to use both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections to your network, note the locations for one or more Wi-Fi access point on your floor plan.</p><p>All of your network wiring should use CAT5e or CAT6 data cable; less expensive CAT5 (no "e") cable can't handle the higher-speed network data that you're likely to need in the future.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_control_center"/>The Control Center</h1></div></div></div><p>The network control center is the location of the switch, router, modem, and other equipment at the core of the network. All of the wiring that connects each outlet to the network converges at the control center. Common locations for a network control center (sometimes known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>wiring closet</em></span>) include closets, utility rooms, and garages or basements. For a very small network (no more than five nodes), you could also consider placing the modem and router on a table next to one of your computers, but that might limit your opportunities for easy expansion of the network in the future.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0488"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0489"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0490"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0491"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0492"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0493"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0494"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0495"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0496"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0497"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0498"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0499"/></p><p>If you plan to distribute audio, video, telephone, or home automation wiring around the house along with computer network data, your control center should have enough space for all of the necessary equipment required by all those services. It will be easier to pull two or more types of cables at the same time than to install each type separately.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0500"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-5-0501"/></p><p>A network control center can have several possible forms: It could be a simple plywood panel attached to the wall, or it might be a pre-wired modular cabinet mounted on a wall or between the wall studs.

If you have access to an unfinished basement or attic, you can run cables through the rafters and joists; but if you have to run cables through finished walls and ceilings, you will probably have to hide cables inside walls and behind baseboards and patch some holes after the wires are in place. Either way, look for the best routes for cables from each network outlet to the control center.
