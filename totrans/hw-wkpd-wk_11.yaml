- en: Articles on Wikipedia can include more than simply text. Images and media files
    enhance content whereas templates (such as the ubiquitous infoboxes) and tables
    can help you lay out articles more cleanly. Well-chosen graphics and neat presentations
    can improve articles significantly. You can also use a number of formatting tricks.
    For example, you can use some HTML successfully, display special characters, and
    add mathematical formulas to articles. These tasks all use advanced wikisyntax,
    which will be covered in this chapter.

    Much of what is covered in this chapter, particularly information about template
    syntax, is not usually necessary for basic editing, but you can generally learn
    how to apply these enhancements quickly if you want to use them to improve an
    article.

- en: Images and media files are a welcome contribution to Wikipedia and complement
    article text in multiple ways. Images might be illustrations, diagrams, photographs,
    or maps; they can show the reader what an animal looks like, where a country is,
    or give a sense of a city's skyline. Media files might include sounds, such as
    the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word or a short clip of a composer's work,
    or videos, such as an animation of how a machine works. What all of these files
    have in common is that they exist to illustrate and clarify article text. Images
    should not be placed in articles simply for the sake of adding a pretty picture,
    but a good, clear image of the subject—or an appropriate sound or video file—can
    greatly enhance any article.

    Though today you can find digital images everywhere on the Web, by and large you
    can't use these images directly in Wikipedia; such use is generally a copyright
    violation, much like copying someone else's text and uploading it as your own.
    A better tactic is to take photographs or produce drawings and diagrams yourself,
    license them freely, and then upload them to Wikipedia for use in articles.

    when doing so, including whether you can claim a *fair use* rationale), and then
    how to embed images in pages, using the special image syntax. We'll then discuss
    media files such as sound and video clips.

    sister projects, the Wikimedia Commons ([http://common.wikimedia.org/](http://common.wikimedia.org/)),
    which serves as an image and media file repository for all of the Wikimedia projects.
    These days uploading and working on images on Commons, where images are more easily
    reusable and searchable, rather than on Wikipedia directly is preferable. A more
    detailed description of this project can be found in [Chapter 16](hw-wkpd-wk_20.html

    images. With this many images, you can most likely find existing images to use

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Wikimedia Commons is probably the best place to start searching for images
    or media files. The easiest way to search is to use the Mayflower search engine
    ( you'll find a link to it on the front page of Commons); Mayflower searches image
    description pages on Commons for your keywords and returns a page of thumbnail-size
    pictures as search results. You can also go to Commons to browse media files and
    images by subject, as most images have been categorized extensively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On Wikipedia itself, you can also browse images using categories. The topmost
    category for images is [[Category:Wikipedia images]]; this category also contains
    images that are only used as part of the Wikipedia project (rather than in articles),
    such as images for WikiProject awards. Under this category you'll find [[Category:Wikipedia
    images by subject]] and [[Category:Wikipedia images by type]], which sorts images
    based on whether they are drawings, animations, and so on. One image collection
    especially worth visiting is [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures]], which is a selection
    of some of the very best images on Wikipedia; here you can find the picture of
    the day and participate in image judging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the Image namespace, as described in [Chapter 3](hw-wkpd-wk_04.html "Chapter 3. Finding
    Wikipedia's Content"). Whether you get any results depends entirely on how well
    the image has been titled and described.

  prefs: []

    such as the GFDL.

    you find on the Web and call them your own. Although disregarding these points
    and uploading technically works anyway, many Wikipedians monitor the list of new
    image uploads, and without a proper license, the image will not remain on the
    site for long (typically, it will be deleted within a week).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last of the criteria, fair use, is only accepted on the English-language
    Wikipedia (*not* on Commons) and is quite controversial, causing much discussion
    over the years. Under US copyright law, the term *fair use* refers generally to
    a limited use of a copyrighted work for educational or critical purposes. For
    instance, when a reviewer quotes a small segment from a book he or she is reviewing,
    the reviewer can do so because of fair use. On Wikipedia, the so-called fair-use
    policy documents when it is acceptable to use a non-free image on the site. For
    example, album covers appear in several articles about albums. Cover art is typically
    copyrighted, but the fair-use policy may mean that a small scanned image of the
    cover is acceptable so long as the album artwork *itself* is critically discussed
    in the article and an image of the artwork is necessary to help clarify this discussion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fair use is controversial on Wikipedia because the site aims to include only
    free content; including any copyrighted material at all is problematic given Wikipedia's
    license and values, and the legal aspects of what is and isn't fair use can be
    very difficult to determine. Given this, so-called fair-use images are only used
    in a very limited range of circumstances. If there is any possibility a *free
    equivalent* to a copyrighted image could be obtained instead at some point in
    the future (for instance, if the copyrighted image is of a living actor and another
    photographer might donate an equivalent photo), then the copyrighted image should
    not be used.

    and to add recurring or boilerplate messages to pages in a consistent way. They
    are versatile and, when properly used, help with the presentation of information.
    A *template* is a page—which could contain, for instance, a navigation menu—that

  prefs: []

- en: Each template may be included (technically *transcluded*) in any number of other
    wiki pages, from just a handful to hundreds of thousands. For programmers, a transcluded
    template is comparable to an `#include` statement or a macro that is run at page
    view time. Templates that you are probably familiar with now are the cleanup messages
    that appear at the top of articles and the stub messages that are placed at the
    very bottom of articles. Templates can also help incorporate complicated formatting
    into articles to standardize them, since templates are created once and then reused.
    A template can provide a consistent, flexible solution for how information displays.
    Wikipedians, therefore, create templates whenever similar text appears in different
    places. Some templates that play a major role in the site are protected, but most
    are editable pages, residing in their own Template namespace.

    if you look at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates]], each nomination is actually

    wikisyntax, CSS, HTML, and even other templates. From the designer's point of

- en: To produce a list of references in two or more columns, you need the `{{reflist}}`
    template, which can replace the `<references/>` tag when using footnoted references.
    For instance, if you have a long list of footnotes and you want them to display
    in two columns, use `{{reflist|2}}` in place of `<references/>`. Use `{{reflist|3}}`
    for a list of references in three columns, and so on. The `{{reflist}}` template
    also conveniently makes footnotes display in a smaller font, so they take up less
    space.

    This is not a template, however, but rather a *variable*. MediaWiki has a wide
    choice of such variables; a list can be found at [[Help:Variables]]. Enclose them
    in double curly brackets to use them. They return a new value each time the page
    is rendered. This value may vary, accounting for the name, and it changes according
    to circumstances, for example, with the time (`{{CURRENTTIME}}`) or the total
    number of articles on the site at that moment (`{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}`).

    list can be found at [[Help:Magic words]]. *Magic words* are symbols recognized
    by the MediaWiki software. When they are seen in the text of the page, they trigger
    the software to do something specific. For example, when the command `__NOTOC__`
    (note the *two* underscores before and after `NOTOC`) is placed somewhere on the
    body of a page, it keeps a table of contents from appearing on a page. Using the
    magic word `__FORCETOC__`, on the other hand, will force a ToC to appear when
    not enough sections appear to automatically generate one. Few other magic words
    are very commonly used in articles.

    `{{TOCleft}}` or `{{TOCright}}` at the top of the page. Moving the ToC may improve
    page layout and image placement (this, like all CSS rendering, is always browser
    dependent to some extent). If you are developing a long list page, the special
    template `{{compactTOC}}` is convenient; it turns the ToC into alphabetical sections
    A–Z that display on one line rather than 26 separate lines. Several variations
    on the `{{compactToC}}` and explanations can be found at [[Wikipedia:Template
    messages/Compact tables of contents]]. For guidelines on reformatting the table
    of contents, see [[Help: Section#Floating_the_TOC]].'
