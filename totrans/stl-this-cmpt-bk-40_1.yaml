    list and dial each number individually to determine what type of computer he has
    reached and how he might be able to break into it.

    to one of the preapproved phone numbers. The caller then hangs up and waits for
    that call. Since the callback device restricts the phone numbers allowed to connect

    phreakers. At the simplest level, stealing cell phone service can be as easy as
    signing up using a fake or stolen identity, although it's even easier just to
    steal someone's cell phone and use it until the real owner cancels the service.
  prefs: []

    way to steal cell phone service, thieves have turned to *cloning*.

    mobile identification number (MIN). Every time someone uses a cell phone, he transmits
    his unique ESN and MIN to the cell phone network, which verifies that the ESN/MIN
    combination is valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    numbers at the start of every call, anyone with a cell phone scanner could intercept
    those numbers and store them on another cell phone, essentially cloning the ESN/MIN
    numbers of a valid cell phone. Any calls made through this "cloned" cell phone
    would show up on the bill of the legitimate cell phone customer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since a cloned phone can only be used until the real cell phone owner notices
    the outrageous number of additional calls showing up on the bill, some thieves
    resort to a technique known as *tumbling*. Originally, tumbling meant using a
    random ESN and MIN number to make a free call. Once the cell phone company received
    these random ESN/MIN numbers, they had to validate these numbers. Since this process
    could take time, the cell phone companies often let random ESN/MIN numbers get
    one free phone call without validating the numbers. Eventually, the cell phone
    companies could validate ESN/MIN numbers almost instantaneously, so tumbling took
    a new form where a thief steals multiple combinations of valid ESN/MIN numbers
    and uses a different one each time he makes a phone call. Tumbling spreads out
    the number of illegal phone calls among a large number of legitimate cell phone
    owners, who are more likely to accept (or not notice) one or two strange calls
    rather than dozens each month.

    the target ever being aware of the hacker's existence. However, in some cases,
    dumpster diving may not yield enough information. In those cases, hackers might
    take the riskier path of dressing up as janitors, temporary workers, or new employees
    and physically wandering around the premises, noting what they see and where equipment
    is located. If this surveillance takes place after hours or during lunch, hackers
    can even peek inside workers' desks and examine computers. With physical access,
    hackers can try to access a network from a trusted computer, or install a keystroke
    logging program to snare the users' passwords as they type them in (see [Chapter 9](ch09.html
    "Chapter 9. Cracking Passwords") for more about these techniques).

    for some hackers (a 13-year-old is likely to have trouble masquerading as a temporary

    to their biography listed under a corporate web page. The more information a hacker

    accomplished by acknowledging, rather than questioning, the target's position
    or authority and developing a rapport with the target. For example, hassled secretaries
    are unlikely to answer questions from a total stranger, but once the hacker develops
    a rapport with him or her (perhaps by making fun of his own boss in a way that
    the secretary might relate to), the hacker can erase any suspicions. This works
    especially well if the hacker can toss out the names of important people, projects,
    or procedures with the familiarity of someone who has worked at or with the company
    for several years.
  prefs: []

    Since helping others—especially someone perceived as trustworthy—can make people
    feel important, most victims of social engineering will willingly give the hacker
    the requested information. The victim doesn't feel like he or she is really losing
    anything; the hacker has only asked for information after all, not something tangible
    like money.

    true purpose with casual requests for assistance and friendly small talk. For
    example, a hacker might complain to a secretary about the company's working conditions,
    casually mention that he's in building F (which anyone at the company would know
    is isolated from the rest of the company's buildings), then suddenly remark that
    he forgot his password back at his desk, which is way across the parking lot in
    another building. He may ask the victim if she knows another password that he
    could borrow for the moment. The victim will volunteer someone else's password
    or, more likely, just give her own. Either way, the hacker now has what he wanted.

    password for in the first place.

    people later learn that someone broke into the computer network using a stolen

    often victimize the same target repeatedly.

    for a password and someone refuses or even gets suspicious, the hacker can just
    hang up and ask somebody else. No matter how suspicious targets may get, they'll
    never be able to find the hacker. Even if they go to the trouble of tracing the
    hacker's phone number, authorities can't arrest him or her because no crime has
    been committed. Even with the longest odds, given enough time, the hacker will
    always succeed.

    indirect attack, which allows the hacker to avoid raising suspicion and cover
    his or her tracks. No one is likely to connect a computer break-in with three

    push up each pin so that the breaks in each pin lie flush with the top of the
    plug. Once all of the pin halves are aligned, you can turn the plug to open the

    Once the lockpicker has pushed the halves of a single pin flush with the plug,

    or rake a pick under the pins to push them all up in one quick motion. This usually
    results in pushing one or more pin halves up to rest on the ridge of the plug,
    at which point the lockpicker needs to push up only the remaining pins individually
    to open the lock.

    Sr. and his National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft published an essay entitled
    "Why We Didn''t Remove Saddam," which offered the President''s justification for
    leaving Saddam Hussein in power after the first war in Iraq:'

    U.S. nor the countries of the region wished to see the breakup of the Iraqi state.
    We were concerned about the long-term balance of power at the head of the Gulf.
    Trying to eliminate Saddam . . .would have incurred incalculable human and political
    costs. . . . We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule
    Iraq. The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in
    anger and other allies pulling out as well. . . .Going in and occupying Iraq,
    thus unilaterally exceeding the U.N.'s mandate, would have destroyed the precedent
    of international response to aggression we hoped to establish. Had we gone the
    invasion route, the U.S. could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly
    hostile land.

    reports, this essay has strangely disappeared from the magazine's own website.
    You can read the entire essay at The Memory Hole ([www.thememoryhole.org/mil/bushsr-iraq.htm](http://www.thememoryhole.org/mil/bushsr-iraq.htm)).

    its own pages? Governments may be embarrassed by their past, but should a supposedly
    objective news magazine feel the same way too?

    like the fictional Oceania government depicted in George Orwell's novel *1984*,
    routinely rewrite history if it contradicts the current line of thinking. Fortunately,
    sites like the Prelinger Archives, located at the Internet Archive site ([www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org)),
    preserve history as seen through films produced by various corporations and government
    agencies over the years.

    such as *Are You Popular?*, which teaches adolescents proper etiquette; *Duck
    and Cover*, which teaches children how to survive a nuclear war; and *Boys Beware*,
    which teaches teenage boys how to avoid potential sexual molesters. By watching
    these films, you can get an idea of how people used to live and think.

    government produced against the Japanese (during World War II when the Chinese
    were our friends) and against the Chinese (during the Korean War when the Japanese
    were our friends). Paramount Pictures even created a Superman cartoon called *Eleventh
    Hour*, in which Superman sneaks into a Japanese World War II shipyard and sabotages
    the Japanese war effort. Government propaganda films will show you how the government
    demonized past enemies, just as they demonize today's enemies.

    and was called *Hemp for Victory*. This movie extols the many benefits of hemp
    farming and claims that growing hemp will aid the war effort. [Figure 3-6](ch03s05.html#during_world_war_ii_comma_the_government
    "Figure 3-6. During World War II, the government encouraged hemp farming as patriotic,
    while today's government declares hemp farming illegal and immoral. Which government
    should you believe?") shows images from the movie, including a government-issued
    tax stamp that proudly identifies certain farmers as patriotic hemp growers.

    definition of "legality" can change over time. If yesterday's patriots would be
    today's criminals, might not today's patriots become tomorrow's criminals, as
    well? Just because something's legal today doesn't necessarily make it right.

    doesn't always mean rebelling or rejecting. Sometimes questioning can mean just
    reaching back through time and learning how certain laws originated in the first
    place. If you don't want to question the present by researching the past, you
    don't have to. Just keep following orders, and within the framework of today's
    laws, you'll be the upstanding citizen that your government always wanted you
    to be.
