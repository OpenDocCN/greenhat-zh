    and take throughout the design and layout phases. Sometimes a component may not
    fit, or a part may not be available, and you’ll have to change the schematic design
    to allow for this shortfall. Other times, you may make a high-level design change
    or you may catch a bug, and the PCB will have to be updated to reflect these changes.
    In my experience, the key to rapidly cranking out a successful PCB design is to
    be flexible on all design fronts.

    to do is to get a very clear vision of what you are trying to build. The more
    specifics you have up front, the easier you will find the design process. You
    should have an idea of how big you want the final board to be, how much it should
    cost, and of course what it should do. I always find it helpful to draw sketches
    and, in the case of large projects, to write design documents that help me organize

    very similar to yours and to model your idea after it. (Many chip manufacturers
    offer free application notes and design samples that form a great starting point.)

    the schematic capture process. However, if you do not find the part you need in
    the library, you will have to build your own schematic symbol. All schematic symbols
    are linked to a PCB component footprint, which is a pattern of copper on a PC
    board that mates to a component.

    mount connector, and most design tools cannot tell the difference between the
    two. Therefore, check to make sure that your footprint assignments are all correct,
    and double and triple check the schematic symbol. In particular, always check
    and recheck power pins, since they can cause the most difficult and destructive
    kinds of errors. Consider having a friend double check the symbols as well, to
    avoid repeating errors or allowing errors to pass unknowingly. (This amount of
    redundancy may sound silly for simple parts, but it becomes absolutely essential
    for hundred and thousand-pin parts where your brain becomes mush halfway through
    the checking process.)'

    left unconnected you should understand why that is or is not okay. To this end,
    read the product data sheets, including every single page and footnote. Don’t
    ignore the fine print that requires a pull-up resistor to set startup conditions,
    or a capacitor to filter noise or stabilize the system or you’re likely to end
    up with more frustrating bugs.

    of errors. A typical set of checks might include catching duplicate part designators,
    dangling nets, and floating inputs.
  prefs: []

    simple checks. For example, many design tools *do not* perform “netlist parity
    checks,” which can be generated fairly easily using a perl script or a spreadsheet
    program. Netlist parity checks are heuristic checks that tally the number of components
    connected to each netlist, then sort the tal y by the number of connections. The
    “single-pin nets” will be at the top of the sorted list. A single-pin net is almost
    always an indication of a typographical error (misspelled netlist name) during
    schematic capture. It can be useful to browse through the whole sorted list briefly,
    to see that all groups of signals have the same number of connections. Most signal
    busses have the same number of connections to every signal in the bus. You can
    create a tool that enables netlist connection tally checks for your schematic
    capture program in an afternoon, and you will undoubtedly save yourself countless
    hours of effort and money by finding the bugs it will catch.

    of the parts in the schematic’s bill of materials. Often, critical parts will
    be in short supply and the schematic capture wil have to be redesigned to account
    for the shortage. Frequently, a change in a component footprint assignment is
    the only redesign necessary. Modifying the schematic design to account for manufacturer’s
    shortages avoids the difficult task of making the change on a finished board layout.

    footprint information. A netlist is an intermediate representation of every component

    of multiple packaging options for a single part. For example, the symbol for a
    transistor could equally imply a tiny SOT-23 packaged device or an enormous TO-3
    packaged device, and it is up to you to ensure that the proper package is chosen
    during netlist extraction. It’s always good to check the implied footprint *when
    the component is placed in a schematic*, rather than checking all at once during
    the netlist translation, or, worse yet, during placement or final design review.

    rules are set by the board fabrication company and include specifications for
    the minimum trace width and minimum trace to trace spacing, minimum hole size,
    minimum through-hole annulus, and the number of power and routing layers. The
    exact design rules depend on the process you choose, which in turn is driven by
    what you can afford. The best processes offer traces as fine as 2 mils (a mil
    is 1/1000th of an inch or 25.4 microns) and laser-drilled blind/buried vias with
    a diameter of about the same, but the price for fabrication is well outside the
    typical hobbyist’s budget of less than one hundred dollars. A more typical hobbyist’s
    process features 6 mil trace/space design rules with 15 mil minimum finished hole
    sizes, with either two or four layers of copper. (You’ll find a list of board
    fabrication companies toward the end of this appendix.)

    placement will greatly simplify the routing task. In general, the goal is to place
    all parts so as to keep connections as short as possible, with as few vias as
    possible, in order to minimize noise, delay, and signal losses. The placement
    of some parts, such as connectors, switches, and power components, are well-constrained,
    leaving you little choice. For the remainder of the parts, an understanding of
    the design will help you to determine which parts should get the best placement.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once your placement is finished, print the design at a scale of 1:1 and verify
    that the components fit in their respective footprints by populating the printed
    layout with the actual components. If you intend to use a socket with a component,
    be sure to use the socket for verifying the 1:1 plot, as sockets require more
    space than the component itself. This check guarantees that you have all the components
    in the correct package type, that all your component outlines are correct, and
    that there is sufficient clearance between each component to facilitate easy assembly.
    Another important thing to check on the 1:1 plot is the orientation and pinout
    of all the connectors because it is very easy to invert a connector or to have
    used the wrong gender’s footprint on the circuit board. Be careful when handling
    chips too, especially those with fine-pitch surface mount leads. Be sure not to
    bend the leads, and observe proper static electricity control protocol.

    surface mount components still require through-hole vias for routability, especially
    in complex and/or auto-routed designs. These routing vias are referred to as “fan-out”

    capacitor. These tiny capacitors are everywhere, and they can consume valuable
    routing and via fan-out space if they are not properly placed. If you are willing
    to create a double-sided surface-mount board, decoupling capacitors can be placed
    on the board side opposite the target component’s pads. By placing these components
    under the component’s pad space, you are not consuming any via fan-out area. In
    fact, a well-placed decoupling capacitor can share the power via used by the component’s
    power pins. The view in the lower left hand corner of Figure C-2 provides a clear
    illustration of this technique. (There are some special cases where you may not

    narrow (~ 5 mil) trace widths. Power traces need to be thickened to counter both
    resistive heating and parasitic inductance. Narrow power traces, especially near
    the key power distribution points, will act like resistors and heat up, dropping
    the supply voltage to a level that causes indeterminate malfunctions in your circuits.

    Typical boards use “1-oz copper” that is 1.35 mils thick (one square foot of 1.35
    mil thick copper foil weights one ounce). An exterior 12 mil wide trace in 1 oz
    copper is required to pass 1 ampere of current with a 10 degree Celsius temperature
    rise. Thicker traces are required for buried layers for a similar current handling
    capacity.

    as well. A single via is insufficient to connect critical power traces between
    layers. Critical power traces should have multiple vias connecting them between
    layers to keep parasitic resistances and inductances down. Distributed power planes
    on multiple layers should also have vias generously distributed throughout to
    ensure that a common potential is preserved.

    or about three inches in a nanosecond. Thus, high speed traces must have matched
    lengths, or signals can arrive significantly out of phase with respect to the
    timing reference. Trace lengths are matched by extending shorter traces to the
    length of the longest trace. Trace length extension is accomplished using serpentine
    traces that meander and increase the effective length of a trace without changing

    of heat. You can save yourself a heat sink under certain conditions by simply
    laying out a large region of copper connected to the heat slug or ground pins

    use multiple vias to help conduct heat into the internal layers.

    hand assembly. The good thermal conductivity of copper makes it difficult to heat
    up a component pin that is also connected to a large region of copper. When connecting
    low-power components to the power planes, consider using vias with *thermal reliefs*.
    A thermal relief is a set of small gaps in a via connection to a power plane that
    reduces thermal conductivity without significantly impacting the connection’s
    electrical performance. (Note that a large group of densely packed thermally relieved
    power vias around a region of copper can result in unconnected or poorly connected

    before applying it to your final design. Auto-routers frequently have critical
    bugs or limitations that must be understood before using the tool. When learning
    an auto-router’s bugs, pay particular attention to how it handles locked traces,
    poured polygons, and awkward trace sizes. Some auto-routers will actually remove
    locked traces (traces laid down by hand and marked as unmovable), while others
    ignore them or do not function in their presence. This can be particularly frustrating
    if you have spent hours laying out the critical power and timing nets before turning

    the original quick-turn prototype PCB houses, with prompt service. The P1 process
    they offer is a basic one, with no soldermask or silkscreen. As a result, it is
    difficult to execute fine-pitch surface mount designs because solder tends to
    get everywhere during the assembly phase. However, they will fabricate and ship
    your board in the P1 process in just one day for an unheard of price, with no
    minimum order requirements. The base fee for a production run is about $45 at
    the time of writing, with approximately a $0.65 per square inch charge on top
    of the base fee. The technology is an 8 mil trace/space with a minimum drill size
    of 20 mil (28 mil if you want to stick with the cheapest process option). AP Circuits
    is great for boards that have to get done in a pinch and on a strict budget, especially
    if you are using through-hole or coarse SMT components that are easy to assemble
    without a soldermask. Visit www.apcircuits.com.

- en: In Chapter 5, “Replacing a Broken Power Supply,” you are instructed on how to
    replace an Xbox power supply with a standard ATX power supply. The one problem
    is that the polarity of the power on signal is inverted between the Xbox and the
    standard ATX supply. The hack solution proposed in the chapter is to always leave
    the supply on, and to instead switch the Xbox on and off by first turning on the
    power supply and then pressing the Xbox’s power button.

- en: It is fairly easy to design and layout a board that enables you to invert the
    polarity of the power signal so that you can control the power state of the Xbox
    from just the front panel of the Xbox. You can also properly regulate the standby
    power supply, instead of using two diodes. Such a board would consist of an inverter
    chip, such as the 74HCT04, and a regulator, such as the LM317K. The LM317K is
    an adjustable regulator that can be set to reduce the +5V standby voltage provided
    by the ATX supply down to the +3.3V standby voltage demanded by the Xbox. An example
    schematic diagram of this board is shown in Figure C-4.

- en: 'The choice of connectors to this board is up to you. The simplest solution
    would be to just use holes and solder the wires through the holes. There are only
    five connections on this board. Three go to the power supply: the +5VSB (violet)
    wire, a ground (black) wire, and the power on output (green) wire. The remaining
    two, +3.3VSB (pin 6 on the power connector) and power on input (pin 11 on the
    power connector), go to the Xbox.'

- en: Be sure to test the voltage output of the regulator before installing your finished
    board. It is fairly easy to get a resistor value wrong or a pin swapped, and both
    of these conditions could lead to dangerously high voltages going into the Xbox.
    Also, when installing the board permanently, be sure to insulate the bottom and
    top of the board from accidental contact with the Xbox case or other Xbox components.
