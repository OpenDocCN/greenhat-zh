But once you have your home or small business network up and running, you can use the network to accomplish some things you might not have expected.</p><p>This chapter describes a handful of other useful network applications. None of these is reason enough to install a network, but if you have come this far, you're already using the network for other purposes. Consider the network programs and services in this chapter as <span class="emphasis"><em>lagniappe</em></span>, a little extra that might enhance your networking experience.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="remote_desktop"/>Remote Desktop</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Remote Desktop</em></span> programs allow another user, with your permission, to take control of your computer through a network. When a remote control program is active, a network manager or service technician can distribute and install new or updated software, provide help and remote assistance, and view information on other computers. Remote Desktop programs are a standard feature in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Macintosh.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2126"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2127"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2128"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2125"/></p><p>Several open source remote desktop programs for Linux and Unix are also available, including Virtual Network Computing (VNC), FreeNX, 2X Terminal Server, and X Display Manager Control Protocol.

The host mirrors the screen display from the client, and the host's mouse and keyboard control the programs running on the client. When Remote Desktop is active, the client computer displays a blank screen and doesn't respond to keyboard or mouse input until the host releases control.</p><p>Remote Desktop makes the person running the host computer a sort of <span class="emphasis"><em>superuser</em></span> who can take control of a client computer, so several controls are built into the system that limit this kind of access: First, the user of the client must set the computer to accept Remote Desktop access, and second, the person running Remote Desktop on the host computer must have an account (usually with a password) on the client computer. In other words, if you turn off Remote Desktop on your computer, other people can't use it without your permission.</p><p>In Windows XP, the remote access tool is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote Access</em></span>; in Windows Vista, it's known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote Desktop</em></span>. Computers running Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic N, or Windows Vista Home Premium won't accept incoming access, but you can use Remote Desktop to take control of another computer running some other version of Vista.

It can also allow you to use the Windows clipboard across two or more computers through the network. These tools aren't for everybody, but under certain conditions, an extended keyboard or shared controls can be hugely convenient. MaxiVista is available in a free demo version from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.maxivista.com/">http://www.maxivista.com/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2164"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2165"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2166"/></p><p>MaxiVista comes as two programs: a server program that runs on the main computer and a client program that runs on each of the secondary machines. Except for the network connections that are already in place, MaxiVista doesn't require any special hardware.</p><p>All of MaxiVista's controls are on the server; the only setting on each client turns the program on or off. The server automatically detects each active client and includes controls that you can use to select either an extended desktop or remote control of client computers.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="multiple_monitors"/>Multiple Monitors</h2></div></div></div><p>Extending the size of your screen display by adding an additional monitor is one of those things that sounds extravagant, but just about everybody who tries it is convinced that the second screen makes them much more productive. Because you can keep two or more windows open at the same time without the need to bring one of them to the top, you can work more efficiently; just for starters, you can drag text, figures, or data from one document or program to another, view large documents and graphics without scrolling from one end of a document to the other, and keep a web browser or video surveillance window open on one screen while you work on the other. If you're writing code or working on a web page, you can save your work and immediately see what your latest changes look like in an application window or a browser. And in many Windows programs, you can drag one or more toolbars away from the main program window to the second screen in order to make more of your work visible.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2167"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2168"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2169"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2170"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2171"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2172"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2173"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2174"/></p><p>Two (or three or more) monitor screens on your desk will change the way you work with your computer. <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#windows_can_show_a_single_large_window" title="Figure 16-4. Windows can show a single large window extended onto two or more screens.">Figure 16-4</a> shows a desktop extended across two laptop computer screens.</p><div class="figure"><a id="windows_can_show_a_single_large_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e18508"/><img alt="Windows can show a single large window extended onto two or more screens." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266470.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 16-4. Windows can show a single large window extended onto two or more screens.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>If you have an old monitor in the back of a closet, try adding it to a computer. Even if the monitor isn't the same size as your main monitor, it will still work and be an improvement over a single screen.</p><p>The easiest way to add another monitor to your system doesn't require MaxiVista or any other special software—simply plug the monitor into a spare VGA or DVI connector on your computer. If your video controller doesn't have an extra video output, install another video controller card in an empty expansion slot. Don't worry about high performance and memory unless you're playing bleeding-edge games; you can use an old PCI video card with as little as 8 or 16 MB of memory from your junk box or a secondhand computer store.</p><p>None of this requires MaxiVista. You can use the Display Properties controls in Windows to extend your desktop to additional monitor screens. But if you want to use a laptop computer as your second screen, or if you already have two or more networked computers on the same table or countertop, MaxiVista allows you to use the monitors on those additional computers as extended screens and switch back to normal use when that's more convenient.</p><p>If you already have both a laptop and a desktop computer, MaxiVista allows you to try an extended screen without the need to haul out any extra hardware; just plug your laptop into the network, install the free trial version of MaxiVista, and reconfigure your Display Properties settings (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#the_display_properties_dialog_includes" title="Figure 16-5. The Display Properties dialog includes an option that can extend the Windows desktop to two or more monitor screens.">Figure 16-5</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_display_properties_dialog_includes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e18526"/><img alt="The Display Properties dialog includes an option that can extend the Windows desktop to two or more monitor screens." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266472.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 16-5. The Display Properties dialog includes an option that can extend the Windows desktop to two or more monitor screens.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="remote_control"/>Remote Control</h2></div></div></div><p>When you're already using two or more computers in the same room, it's often a nuisance to move among the keyboards and mice that control them.

Simply use the mouse from the main computer to select and copy a file, folder, block of text, or other object to the clipboard just as you normally copy objects on a local computer. Then move the mouse cursor to the target computer, open a program (or select an already open window), and paste the contents of the clipboard.</p></div></div>

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="instant_messaging_and_live_communicatio"/>Instant Messaging and Live Communication</h1></div></div></div><p>As the name suggests, <span class="emphasis"><em>instant messaging (IM)</em></span> is the process of sending text or other data that arrives at its destination almost immediately. The most common forms are <span class="emphasis"><em>text messaging</em></span>, in which the participants use their keyboards to conduct a conversation on a display screen, and <span class="emphasis"><em>audio</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>video messaging</em></span>, where a microphone and/or a camera replace or supplement the keyboard.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2184"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2185"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2186"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2187"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2188"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2189"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2190"/></p><p>Live messaging is more immediate than email because it arrives on the recipient's screen as soon as the originator hits the Send button, rather than waiting for a mail server to forward each message. Assuming the distant computer is turned on and the messaging program is running, the text appears on the screen or the sender's voice comes through the computer's speakers immediately. Live messaging makes it possible to conduct a text-based conversation through the network, without the time delay that comes with sending and receiving email.</p><p>The most common uses for instant messages involve brief questions and answers such as requests for specific items of information ("Hey Sarah, I'm on the telephone with a customer. How many Size 4 gizmo brackets do we have in stock?"), invitations to face-to-face meetings ("Can you meet me in ten minutes in my office?" or "Do you have plans for lunch?"), and purely social exchanges among friends and family. IM has also become the medium of choice for online gossip among teens and preteens.</p><p>IM has a specific place in the hierarchy of communication methods. It's less formal and more immediate than email or facsimile (fax), less intrusive than telephone calls, and more civilized than shouting from one room to another. In some businesses and families, IM is an essential part of the culture; others hardly use it at all. For an extensive study of instant messaging and the way people in business use it, take a look at "Interaction and Outeraction: Instant Messaging in Action" (Proceedings of Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 79-88 New York: ACM Press, <a class="ulink" href="http://dis.shef.ac.uk/stevewhittaker/outeraction_cscw2000.pdf">http://dis.shef.ac.uk/stevewhittaker/outeraction_cscw2000.pdf</a>). The authors of this study offer some interesting insights, but they have buried them under some seriously dense academic language, using highfalutin words like <span class="emphasis"><em>dyadic</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>ethnomethodology</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2191"/></p><p>Just about every messaging program has a similar structure: It displays a list of other users, with an indicator that shows whether each user is currently available to receive a message. Users might not be available because their messaging program is not active or because they have set the program to not accept incoming messages. To start a conversation, click the intended recipient's name. When a message arrives, it appears in a pop-up window on the recipient's screen (some programs also sound an audible signal when they receive a new message).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Instant messaging is not the same as online chat, but the experience is similar. The difference is that chat takes place among two or more participants who connect to a common channel (a <span class="emphasis"><em>chatroom</em></span>). When you join a chat, you instruct the program to connect to a specific chatroom. Instant messaging appears to connect two participants' computers directly to each other, so you specify the name of the other participant rather then the channel. After you make the initial connection, there's not much difference between chat and IM.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="servers_vs._peer-to-peer_messaging"/>Servers vs. Peer-to-Peer Messaging</h2></div></div></div><p>Instant messaging services can use two different structures: through <span class="emphasis"><em>message servers</em></span> that receive all messages and forward them to their ultimate destinations and <span class="emphasis"><em>peer-to-peer</em></span> systems that forward each message directly from its source to its destination. <a class="xref" href="ch16s04.html#internet_instant_messaging_servers_and" title="Figure 16-6. Internet instant messaging servers and peer-to-peer chat use different structures to accomplish similar objectives.">Figure 16-6</a> shows both types.

Messenger, or a service that exchanges messages with a mobile telephone. Other messaging programs are available that operate within a LAN.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2198"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2199"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2200"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2201"/></p><p>Unfortunately, many IM services are self-contained networks; for example, you can't use Google Talk software to send a message to an AIM account. However, several third-party programs—such as Pidgin (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pidgin.im/">http://www.pidgin.im/</a>); Trillian (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/</a>); and meebo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.meebo.com/">http://www.meebo.com/</a>)—are available that can exchange messages with people on different services from a single contact list and message window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2202"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2203"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2204"/></p><p>To set up a new IM account with one or more of the major services, go to their respective websites:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Google Talk (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.google.com/talk/">http://www.google.com/talk/</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jabber (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jabber.org/">http://www.jabber.org/</a>)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2205"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>AIM or AOL Instant Messenger (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.aim.com/">http://www.aim.com/</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Yahoo!

It's more secure and more private because the messages never leave the LAN. And they aren't exposed to spam and other unwanted messages from strangers through the Internet. In addition, they don't use bandwidth between the LAN and the Internet, so they don't interfere with other activities, and they don't require a separate account for each user with an IM service (although the major IM services all offer free accounts). More importantly, a local messaging system controls all of your messages within the LAN, rather than sending everything to an outside service.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="messaging_through_a_lan"/>Messaging Through a LAN</h2></div></div></div><p>Many LAN messaging programs are available, all with similar feature sets. Some are limited to a single operating system, whereas others offer compatible versions for exchanging messages between different computer types. In most cases, the same program must be running on each computer connected to the LAN; you can't assume that two different LAN messenger programs will automatically recognize each other.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2207"/></p><p>SoftRos Lan Messenger (<a class="ulink" href="http://messenger.softros.com/">http://messenger.softros.com/</a>) is typical of this category.

The world's telephone companies spent many years and huge amounts of money trying to develop a successful commercial "picturephone" service as a supplement to traditional voice telephone calls, but it never happened until they repackaged it as "videoconferencing." Adding pictures to telephone service seemed like a good idea but it turned out to be too expensive and too intrusive to be practical for individual users. As a business proposition, call-based picturephones were a complete flop.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2210"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2211"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2212"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2213"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2214"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2215"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2216"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2217"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2218"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2219"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2220"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2221"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-16-2222"/></p><p>But less expensive video devices and higher bandwidth have made it possible to send and receive both still pictures and full-motion video through computer networks.
