- en: So you've read a few introductory books about Ruby, you have a good feel for
    the syntax, and you've written "Hello, world!" about 20 different optimized ways—now
    what? This book is intended to give your mind an exercise in Ruby as a scripting
    language.

- en: Scripting—that is, automating repetitive tasks you're not prepared to do yourself—is
    one of those things that a good language must be able to do. Perl and Python are
    two of the most widely known scripting languages, and their popularity has a direct
    correlation to their usefulness for scripting. Writing utilities should not be
    a cryptic task, nor should scripts take an inordinate amount of time to create.
    It is in that spirit that Ruby was born.

- en: The designer of Ruby, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, had an overall vision to create
    a language that would be easy to use in everyday tasks. He felt the language should
    be fun to write so that more energy could be put toward creative processes with
    less stress. When they aren't distracted by the peculiarities of a language, programmers
    can focus on writing better programs. When you need to write a script, the last
    thing you want to worry about is weird syntax and compilers interpreting your
    code. Ruby is written in such a way that the syntax and programming flow is natural.
    I have found Ruby to be comfortable to work with because of its natural syntax,
    wonderful community, and simplistic view of how programming should be. As you
    will see throughout this book, Ruby makes scripting a breeze!

    that by automating repetitive tasks, you will free up much of your time to do
    more important things… like writing other wicked cool Ruby scripts. I hope this
    book helps you see the many uses of Ruby and makes you a better programmer.

    cool script is something that is useful, challenging, and, above all, educational.
    Not educational in the schoolmarm sense of the word, but rather as a stimulus
    to use Ruby to its full potential—to push the language to its limits.

    not intended for someone looking to learn Ruby 101\. Sure, you can use the scripts
    and see potential applications of Ruby without being proficient in it. But to
    get the full benefit from the information presented, I assume you are familiar
    with Ruby and do not need the simpler features of the language explained. I will
    briefly walk through each script and highlight only the most important parts.

    Most of the comments and documentation have been taken out of the source code
    in the book for brevity's sake. Some of the scripts have more detailed explanations
    if I felt clarity was needed. I highly encourage commenting your own code so you
    and other people can understand how it works.

    the underlying principles involved in writing the script. Finally, I'll put you
    in the driver's seat and suggest some ways you can hack the script to make it
    your own and more versatile. These scripts are not going to solve every need you
    have, but my hope is that they will help you think about how you can write your
    own scripts—learning through example. Feel free to download the scripts and use
    them however you want to.

    it's through the Web, email, or physical media. One problem I've run into, though,
    is that the amount of photographs I take becomes overwhelming. I can't do the
    things I used to enjoy, like organizing, touching-up, or sharing photos with people,
    because there are too many images, and I don't have enough time to go through
    them all. This chapter will show you ways to automate the tedious task of resizing,
    renaming, and organizing your digital photographs. I will also show you how to
    protect your creative works by watermarking your photos. For readers who like
    to analyze picture information, this chapter also demonstrates how to extract
    the information stored in the metadata.
