    means that you need to have a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your box
    to the outside world. These modems, in case you’ve forgotten, are those wonderful
    machines that whistle, chime, screech, and spit whenever you dial up your Internet
    provider. I suppose you could think of them as noisy telephones in need of a good
    burp.

- en: The biggest drawback to dealing with modems in Linux is that very few modems
    are supported by Linux. On the positive side of things, though, once you do find
    a modem that works, it is relatively easy to set up. The main culprit in the compatibility
    problem is a beast called the Winmodem. As hardware makers try to bring you cheaper
    and cheaper machines, they inevitably try to cut costs here and there. The Winmodem
    is one of these cost-cutting developments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although a Winmodem is, technically speaking, a piece of hardware, it is a far
    cry from what is known as a hardware modem. A hardware modem is, to oversimplify
    things a bit, a telephone without a handset and dial that plugs in to your computer
    somewhere. It is a fully functioning machine that only needs your system for dial-up
    and connection information. A Winmodem, on the other hand, is totally system dependent.
    It is a faux modem that has more in common with a lamprey than a telephone, in
    that it must utilize the Windows system in order to do its chores. As you are
    not using a Windows system when you are using Linux, you are sort of sunk, as
    the Winmodem has nothing to utilize. The fact that most of a Winmodem’s work is
    done by the system itself means that it is a very simple piece of hardware. This
    means, of course, that Winmodems are much cheaper to produce than true hardware
    modems. That being the case, you can be fairly sure that if you have a built-in
    modem in your machine, it is a Winmodem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with these Winmodem
    beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. When they do work, Winmodems
    are called Linmodems, but support for the wide variety of modem models is still
    rather spotty. If you are not sure what kind of modem you have installed, my advice
    would be to go through the Internet connection setup process to see if your modem
    works or not. If it doesn’t, you can replace the modem with one that is known
    to work, preferably a true hardware modem.

    to use an external serial modem. An external modem sits in a box outside your
    computer, and it connects to the serial port in the back of the computer, which
    is the one that looks like a hole with little prongs in it (see [Figure 4-2](#figure.DDU32)).
    Because the modem doesn’t use your operating system to operate, it does not tie
    up system resources while it’s busy, which may result in a possible pickup in
    computer speed.

    you received from your Internet service provider handy. These should consist of
    your POP host address (for receiving mail), your SMTP host address (for sending
    mail), and your mail password, which is very often different from your Internet
    logon password. Your mail password is not actually entered during the various
    wizard steps, so check the **Remember this password** checkbox when filling in
    the POP details. When you first connect to your mail server, you will be prompted
    for your mail password, so you can type it in at that time and you won’t have
    to deal with it again.

    world, but despite its obvious attractions and popularity, I prefer the more straightforward
    Mozilla Mail for my email chores. In contrast to the multi- functional Evolution,
    Mozilla Mail is a mail-only program that is very straightforward to use. It is
    also the program you want to use if you have to deal with mail in multiple character
    sets (English and Japanese, for example), as Evolution seems weaker in this area.
    Mozilla Mail also has a handy and effective Junk Mail Control feature to help
    you deal with junk email (spam). If you would like totry out Mozilla Mail, you
    can run it from the Main menu by selecting **Internet** > **More Internet Applications**
    > **Mozilla Mail**. Try both Evolution and Mozilla Mail and use whichever you
    like better. That’s one of the great things about Linux: choices.'

    launcher in your GNOME Panel to launch Mozilla Mail to make things easier on yourself.
    Just right-click the email icon in the panel, and then in the Properties window,
    change the name “Evolution Email” to Mozilla Mail and the command “evolution”
    to /usr/bin/mozilla -mail.

- en: Fedora Core allows you to do instant messaging too. It doesn’t matter if you
    usually use MSN/Windows Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger
    (AIM), or ICQ; you can set up Gaim, a single application, to check *all* of these
    messaging accounts. The question most people had in the past, however, was *how*
    to set up Gaim to do this — it was, shall we say, less than intuitive. In the
    new version of Gaim that ships with Fedora Core, however, things have gotten much
    easier, so you are really in luck.

    > **Instant Messenger**. Click the **Accounts** button, and in the Accounts window
    click **Add**. This will bring up the Add Account window shown in [Figure 4-15](#figure.DDU44).

    appropriate protocol for your messaging service in the drop-down menu. Then type
    in your screen name (usually the email address under which your messaging account
    is registered), your password (your messaging password, that is), and finally,
    your alias (the nickname that other people see when you are in their buddy’s list).
    Once you’ve done all this, click **Save**, and then close the other Gaim windows,
    including the main one. Now run Gaim again, and your new account will appear in
    the main Gaim window (see [Figure 4-16](#figure.DDU45)). All you have to do now
    is click **Sign On**, and you will be blabbing in no time.

    browser, which is useful if you want to save Web pages as PDF files, and, as I
    will discuss in [Chapter 8](DDU0064_split_000.html#345), yet another Web browser
    called Epiphany. However, there are other applications included for different
    Internet tasks, and I will briefly mention a few of these now.

    have used similar software under different operating systems. You can run X-Chat
    by going to the Main menu and selecting **Internet** > **More Internet Applications**
