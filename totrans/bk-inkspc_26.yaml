- en: The primary vector format used by Inkscape is called *Inkscape SVG*; as explained
    in **[1.4 A Brief History of SVG](ch01s04.html "1.4 A Brief History of SVG")**,
    it is (almost) standard-compliant SVG with some Inkscape-specific extensions that
    affect only the editability of various object types in Inkscape, but never change
    their appearance. It does not make much sense to save as *Plain SVG* except when
    you are trying to achieve a modest file size gain or encounter some buggy software
    having problems with Inkscape SVG. Both SVG flavors have *compressed* varieties
    (using the *.svgz* file name extension), which produce much smaller files but
    are otherwise the same and should be understood by most SVG software.

- en: SVG files exported from Adobe Illustrator can be opened in Inkscape as usual.
    However, these files usually contain a lot of AI-specific stuff, which is useless
    for Inkscape and just blows up the size of the SVG file. It is recommended to
    save SVG files from AI with the extension *.ai.svg* instead of simply *.svg*.
    When you open such a *.ai.svg* file in Inkscape, it goes through a special filter
    which removes the AI-specific binary chunks and converts AI layers into Inkscape
    layers.

    recognized vector format (**[1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats](ch01s05.html#onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector
    "1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats")**). While Inkscape cannot yet be recommended
    for roundtrip PDF editing (i.e., opening a PDF, editing its content, and saving
    back as PDF) due to the font support limitations (see the following section),
    PDF is definitely the best option for connecting Inkscape with software which
    does not support SVG.

    and supports most of static features of latest versions of PDF (shapes, text,
    images, gradients, opacity, etc.). Interactive PDF features (such as forms) are
    not supported. Since Inkscape cannot have multiple pages in one document, you
    will need to specify which single page from a PDF file to import. This choice
    is the main purpose of the **PDF Import Settings** dialog you see when you try
    to import or open a PDF file ([Figure B-2](apbs03.html#pdf_import_options "Figure B-2. PDF

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest limitation of the current PDF import support is its treatment of
    fonts. Most PDF files have their fonts embedded, and Inkscape cannot use these
    embedded fonts, nor can it convert text to paths on import (the **Text handling**
    choice in the **PDF Import Settings** dialog has only one option, **Import text
    as text**). In practice, this means that any text in the imported PDF file will
    look right if and only if the font it uses is installed on your system; otherwise,
    a default font will be used which will not only look different but, in most cases,
    will badly butcher spacing and alignment in text columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An additional complication is that most PDFs refer to the font they use by their
    *PostScript names*, which are slightly different from the names of fonts your
    operating system shows. For example, PDF may refer to a font called `AlbertusMT-Light`
    whereas the same font in your Inkscape list is called `Albertus MT Lt`. Inkscape
    tries its best to convert the PostScript names to regular names, but it can only
    do this for fonts which you have installed, and even then it sometimes fails and
    chooses a wrong installed font.

    which has no counterpart in PDF. Therefore, you have the option of converting
    any filtered objects to bitmaps on export (**Rasterize filter effects**). If you
    uncheck this, filters will be simply ignored (e.g., any blurred object will be
    crisp). Rasterization has the disadvantage of inflating the file size and losing
    the vector editability of the objects affected, but it preserves the filtered
    appearance of the objects. The **resolution** parameter applies to these automatically
    generated filter bitmaps; set it to 90 dpi for PDFs that are intended for viewing
    on screen, and to at least 300 dpi for PDFs that are intended for print.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rest of the options specify which objects and what area of the document
    to export into PDF. By default, the page size of the PDF is the same as that of
    your SVG, and any objects outside the page are therefore hidden (but still present
    in the PDF code). If you enable **Export drawing, not page**, the PDF page will
    be as big as the bounding box of the entire drawing, regardless of its page size.
    The **Limit export** option ensures that only the objects whose IDs (**[4.1 Object
    Properties](ch04s01.html "4.1 Object Properties")**) you list here will be exported,
    while all others are ignored. For example, in a file with several logos you can
    export each logo to its own PDF file using this option; make sure to also enable
    the **Export drawing, not page**, which in this case interprets “drawing” as “those
    objects that will be exported.”

    of PostScript but is at the same time richer (most importantly, it supports transparency)
    and much easier to support in software. So, whenever you have the choice, use
    PDF instead of PostScript; however, a lot of old projects and clipart exist as

    also because, to print a document, by default Inkscape exports it to the format
    that the printer understands—which, depending on the printer driver, is either
    PostScript or PDF (SVG-capable printers exist but are rare so far). If you select
    the **Print to file** option from the **Print** dialog, you will get a PS or PDF
    file that looks exactly the same as if you saved your file with this file type.

    or PDF). As explained earlier, Inkscape is smart enough to rasterize those objects
    using the features these formats don’t support: filters (both PS and PDF) and
    transparency (PS only). However, if for some reason you don’t like this selective
    rasterization, you can render the entire document into bitmap by switching from
    **Vector** to **Bitmap** on the **Rendering** tab and setting the bitmap resolution.
    This option is generally safer, as it avoids any kinds of surprises that format
    conversion may hold, but it may result in very large print files and slow printing.'

    to approximate them with a lattice of small flat-color path “tiles.” In the **PDF
