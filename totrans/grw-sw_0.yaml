- en: In many small and growing companies, engineering managers are often in the unique
    position of having to deal with the technical team and other senior managers,
    while simultaneously taking direction from the CEO. Too often, development managers
    focus only on technology, even though the nontechnical aspects of the job can
    have the biggest impact on a company's success. As your company grows, problems
    that once seemed small can grow accordingly, exploding into major disasters. I
    wrote *Growing Software* to offer advice for newer development managers about
    how to succeed when faced with these diverse challenges.

- en: The role of a development manager at a small company differs from the same role
    in a large and stable company in many ways. For example, the development manager
    at a small company must often work with developers to support an immature product.
    Development managers must also work with the strong personalities who are attracted
    to the challenges faced by growing companies. But most of all, a small company's
    development manager must have a wide focus that includes employees, product, process,
    planning, technology, and customers.

- en: In contrast, large companies typically support multiple existing products, and
    their processes are usually well defined and relatively static. Policies in large
    companies typically limit the choices of tools, techniques, and approaches that
    a development manager can use. The manager's role is more specific and much narrower
    in scope than the same role in a small firm.

- en: '*Growing Software* serves as a practical, hands-on guide for development managers
    at small companies that have moved past the initial survival stage and are trying
    to grow. It is intended to help the manager look ahead and deal with problems
    before they become unwieldy. The techniques described here are useful for small
    firms producing software for sale or for a software-as-a-service offering; they
    are not directed at software consulting businesses. *Growing Software* provides
    general advice, specific solutions, and detailed templates and spreadsheets to
    help development managers put general concepts into direct action.'

- en: Because the scope of the book is broad, it is written in a prescriptive style
    rather than an argumentative one—that is, many recommendations are not supported
    by exhaustive arguments as to why the techniques work well. Although this information
    would have greatly increased the scope of the book, it would have made it less
    readable.

- en: For convenience, I use the terms *development manager* and *development management*
    throughout this book to describe the *top* software/engineering manager—whether
    the particular job title is chief technology officer (CTO), vice president of
    engineering, director of engineering, or senior engineering manager. This person
    manages software engineers, but he or she might also manage quality assurance,
    documentation, and project management groups. Although the target audience for
    this book is the person in charge of all of development, nontechnical managers
    will also be interested in the problems and solutions described here.

    analyzing, and displaying information to solve specific types of problems. Each
    is illustrated and described in the text and can be downloaded from [http://www.nostarch.com/growingsoftware.htm](http://www.nostarch.com/growingsoftware.htm)
    to be used in Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc, adjusting for each program's
    minor differences. The primary purpose of the examples is to teach how to analyze
    and solve underlying problems with a simple spreadsheet.

- en: Although the spreadsheets can be used as is, many problems will require that
    you customize the basic spreadsheet layout. You can re-create a spreadsheet by
    typing all the fields into a spreadsheet program. Arrows point to particular cells
    to indicate a formula you can enter, with a description to the right or below
    the example. As appropriate, copy the formula across a row or column as described
    in the note attached to the spreadsheet. [Figure 1](pr02.html#this_sample_spreadsheet_illustrates_cell
    "Figure 1. This sample spreadsheet illustrates cell instructions.") illustrates
    these conventions.

- en: When entering formulas, pay attention to dollar sign ($) characters that affect
    how a formula reads data when it is copied from one cell to another. Not including
    the dollar sign character can result in incorrect calculations after the formulas
    are copied.

    format for an entry is General, which will not display all values in the most
    appropriate ways. Formatting is implied from the examples: *Dates* should use
    Date formatting; *currency* amounts should use Currency formatting with zero digits
    after the decimal; and *numbers* should use Number formatting with the rounding
    chosen based on how many digits are of interest.'

- en: 'OpenOffice.org Calc uses a semicolon (;) to separate fields in a formula, and
    Microsoft Excel uses a comma (,). This book uses commas to separate fields in
    all formulas. If you are working in Calc, use semicolons instead. For example,
    the Excel formula *=WORKDAY(B3, C3)* looks like this in Calc: *=WORKDAY(B3; C3)*.'

- en: A second important difference is the *inter-sheet reference* used to refer to
    cells in other worksheets. The inter-sheet reference is an exclamation point (!)
    in Excel but a period in Calc. For example, a formula that references the *Eng*
    sheet appears in Excel as *=Eng!H3* but appears as *=Eng.H3* in Calc.
