<p class="docText1"><a name="SpamAssassin is" class="calibre8" id="SpamAssassin is"/>SpamAssassin is a highly effective open source email classifier. It is designed to examine email using a diverse set of tests to determine if a message is spam. Messages are scored using keywords, historical data (e.g., Bayesian filtering), and fingerprinting methods (e.g., Vipul's Razor and DCC databases) to maximize effectiveness by leveraging the benefits of each type of test. SpamAssassin stores the results of these tests in each email's header. Mail Delivery Agents (MDA) like Procmail (see "<a class="calibre2" href="procmail_3.22.html#procmail_3.22">Procmail 3.22</a><a name="these headers" class="calibre8" id="these headers"/>") can use these headers to route or perform further processing of the message.<a name="IDX-CHP-28-0424" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0424"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0425" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0425"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0426" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0426"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0427" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0427"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0428" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0428"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0429" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0429"/><a name="IDX-CHP-28-0430" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-28-0430"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="daemon or" class="calibre8" id="daemon or"/>Typically, SpamAssassin is invoked as a daemon or background process. A mail transfer agent like Postfix is configured to pipe email through SpamAssassin for analysis. If a message is determined to be spam, SpamAssassin can be configured to modify the message in a number of ways. By default, spam is re-encoded as an attachment and the body of the message displays the list of tests that triggered the positive result. Spam and <span class="docEmphasis1">ham</span><a name="delivered to" class="calibre8" id="delivered to"/> (legitimate email) are then delivered to users' mailboxes.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="packages incorporate" class="calibre8" id="packages incorporate"/>Many commercially available anti-spam packages incorporate SpamAssassin in their products. These include SpamKiller by McAfee, Kerio MailServer by Kerio, and SmarterMail by SmarterTools.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="is based" class="calibre8" id="is based"/>SpamAssassin was written in 2001 by Justin Mason, an Irish software developer. It is based on filter.plx, a spam filter written in Perl by Mark Jeftovic in 1997. Justin contributed patches to Jeftovic's filter.plx and later decided to rewrite the code (also in Perl) from scratch. This recode became SpamAssassin and is now a project of the Apache Software Foundation. Mason currently directs SpamAssassin development as a vice president of the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
