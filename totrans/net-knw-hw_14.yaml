    full of computer users is the convenience of sharing one or more printers among
    all the network's users. Rather than carrying a copy of each file to the computer
    connected to the printer on a disk or a flash drive, you can simply click the
    Print command on your own computer and let the network send it to the printer
    automatically.

    you might use a black-and-white laser printer for routine documents and reports,
    a color inkjet or laser printer for fancy presentations and school projects, and
    a special-purpose color printer for digital photos. If you have more than one
    printer, you can select the best printer for each job. Each of these printers
    might be located in a different room, close to the person who uses it most often,
    or in a central room where they're equally accessible to all of your network's
    users.

    methods accomplish the same thing: They send a formatted document or image to

    ports, use the USB port.

    in more than one room and you have at least one spare port on the network hub
    or router. You can run an Ethernet cable to the server unit directly from the
    hub in the same room or from an unused wall outlet in another room. If you don't
    have enough Ethernet ports in the room where you want to place the printer server,
    connect the computer and the printer server to the network through an inexpensive
    Ethernet data switch, as shown in [Figure 14-2](ch14.html#if_you_don_apostrophy_t_have_a_spare_ne

    cable between that room and your network hub, and use a wall outlet plate (or

    each outlet to make it easier to identify them at a glance.

- en: Adding a printer server to your network is similar to adding a computer, except
    that you'll have to configure the printer server remotely from a computer. The
    usual routine is to connect the server to the network and the printer to the server
    and then use a web-based configuration utility to set the server's network address
    and other options. Follow the instructions supplied with the server to load the
    printer driver.
  prefs: []

    it operates independently of the other computers on the network. When a printer
    connects through a computer, that computer must be on all the time or you have
    to create a "public" account that the rest of the family or office can use to
    print. This setup is a lot less secure than printing through a server.

    server to connect your printer to the network. The printer server should automatically
    detect the Wi-Fi signal from your access point and establish a two-way connection
    (data in and printer status out) between the printer and the computer that originated
    the print request. The Wi-Fi link should use all the same security tools (such
    as WPA encryption) as your other Wi-Fi connections.
  prefs: []

    network, so a large document might slow down the network's performance, but slow
    performance is not likely to be an issue unless your network carries a *lot* of
    traffic. You can solve this problem by adding a second access point that uses
    a different channel and dedicating that access point to one or more printers.

    the combination of a low-end, stand-alone printer and a separate printer server
    device, because they're generally more durable printers with more and better features.

    rooms, an automatic printer switch might be a less expensive alternative to a
    network printer server. As the name suggests, an automatic switch detects print
    requests from two or more input connectors and automatically forwards them to
    the printer, and the switch returns status information from the printer back to
    the computer that originated the request. When it receives more than one print
    request at the same time, the printer switch sends the first one to the printer
    and holds the other requests in a buffer until the first one has completed printing.
    As far as each computer attached to the switch is concerned, the printer is connected
    directly to that computer.
