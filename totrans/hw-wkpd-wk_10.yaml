- en: In [Chapter 3](hw-wkpd-wk_04.html "Chapter 3. Finding Wikipedia's Content"),
    we described many ways to browse Wikipedia. For instance, readers can explore
    Wikipedia via the links between pages or through categories of related articles.
    If an area of Wikipedia has been worked on for long enough, these browsing journeys
    go smoothly. But Wikipedia's content does not start out perfectly linked or classified,
    and new articles need to be integrated with existing content. Articles need care
    and attention to become fully usable in the context of the rest of the site.

    alter, and mend Wikipedia as a piece of hypertext. We'll cover six concepts for
    building navigational structures, linking articles, and maintaining article organization.
    These concepts have been mentioned in previous chapters, but here we'll present
    them as editorial tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we'll cover redirecting one page title to another and building disambiguation
    pages, both of which help readers navigate, avoid duplication, and search the
    site more productively. We'll then focus on how articles are combined, split apart,
    or moved to better titles in order to comply with style guidelines and to make
    them more useful for the reader. In the next section, we'll discuss categories
    and categorization, which help readers navigate similar topics and editors maintain
    sets of pages. Finally, we'll review community processes for resolving problems
    that arise related to these topics.

    "Chapter 1. What's in Wikipedia?"), play important roles in internal Wikipedia
    connections. A *redirect* page directly points the reader from one page title
    to another and is used when more than one possible page title exists. *Disambiguation*
    pages clarify the use of a keyword by pointing to all of the articles that are
    referred to by that term or a similar term.

    the article can only exist under one title, redirects automatically take the reader
    to the actual article from any conceivable title that he or she might search for.

    more redirect pages than article pages, by somewhere between 5 percent to 10 percent.
    Historical figures, with their varying names, titles, and multiple spellings,
    are a prolific source of redirects. Other significant sources are Romanizations
    of names and terms from other languages. For instance, English does not have a
    standard way for writing Arabic names: *Mohammed, Mohammad*, and *Mohamed* are
    all accepted ways of writing the Prophet''s name. All of these possible spellings
    redirect to the actual article title (currently [[Muhammad]]), saving the reader

    command post of a ship. With all these meanings, wikilinks to the article [[Bridge]]

    the two articles as candidates for a *merge*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of a merge is to end up with one good, coherent article that incorporates
    all facts, concepts, and references from both articles without duplicating material.
    The ideal merge results in a better article. No content should be lost in a merge;
    instead, all of the relevant facts should end up in one article, and the other,
    alternate title redirects readers to the new combined article.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another, more complex case is when several small articles need to be consolidated
    into one more satisfactory and broader article. For instance, an article about
    a band member may be merged into the article about the band if little independent
    information about the musician in question is available. Sometimes a noun and
    antonym, or two similar terms, make more sense in a single article (e.g., [[Supralapsarianism]]
    and [[Infralapsarianism]]). These cases generally require more discussion and
    may be controversial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good merge is an unhurried, multipass procedure requiring many edits. Because
    merges require skill, a single editor often performs the merge once all the interested
    editors have agreed to it. This can vary from article to article; for articles
    where one title is misspelled or when the two articles are nearly identical, objections
    are unlikely. ([[William M. Ramsey]] and [[William Mitchell Ramsay]] is an example
    of this kind of duplication, where two articles were accidentally created about
    the same person.) Problems may arise, however, if you want to combine two similar
    concepts and another editor wants to maintain a distinction between the concepts.
    For instance, in mathematics, fractions and rational numbers are covered in separate
    articles—[[Fraction (mathematics)]] and [[Rational number]]—even though fractions
    are, in fact, rational numbers.

    are even incorrect or misleading, usually as the result of an honest mistake.
    Articles should be placed in categories simply to inform, never to make a point
    or forward a controversial position. Obviously, if an article about a person is
    in a category damaging to his or her reputation, the classification should be
    fully supported within the article. No one should just add [[Category:Murderers]],
    unjustified, to a biography. Wikipedia doesn't allow its category system to be
    used as a way of commenting on content.

    basic policies of Verifiability, No Original Research, and Neutral Point of View

    references (or more properly by statements in the article''s text that are themselves
    referenced), especially if the category is contentious. (One disadvantage of categories
    as opposed to lists: You can add sources to a list to support inclusion, but you

    Are detailed subsubcategories a good thing or not? Certainly having categories
    that contain too many articles can be unwieldy; a category with more than 200
    articles in it requires multiple pages. Subcategorizing the articles into more
    distinct categories can help keep categories manageable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Subcategories are useful on Wikipedia to subclassify when the schematic being
    followed is fairly natural to the subject matter and the relevance is evident.
    [[Category:Politicians with blue eyes]] is not helpful—why would anyone be looking
    for this information? But [[Category:Canadian buskers]] is an acceptable subcategory
    of [[Category:Buskers]] or of [[Category:Canadian musicians]]. Subcategories should
    offer the general reader a convenient way to navigate a category and also provide
    information about the material included in a category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Following a general but not quite universal convention, articles should not
    appear in both a category and a subcategory. For instance, [[Category:Beetles]]
    within [[Category:Insects]] classifies some insects more precisely. According
    to the convention, the beetle articles should not also be in the more general
    [[Category:Insects]]. Therefore, in searching [[Category:Insects]] for *all* the
    Wikipedia articles on insects, you would also have to search [[Category:Beetles]]
    and, within that, more than a dozen subcategories to find all of the beetle pages.
    Going through all the subcategories is the only comprehensive way to find all
    the articles related to a larger category, such as insects; if in this case you
    went to the page [[List of insects]], you''d discover this list is a redirect
    to [[Category:Insects]]. While finding all Wikipedia articles about insects is
    probably unreasonable (as the category is enormous), creating extremely detailed
    subcategories for smaller topics can make it difficult to see all the related
    articles at a glance. On the other hand, articles should always placed in the
    most detailed category that applies: An article about a beetle found in New Zealand
    should be placed in the Beetles of New Zealand category, not the higher-level
    category Beetles.'

    [[Jolly Green Giant]] to [[Green Giant]]—but you'd find that [[Green Giant]] is
    already taken up with a page about the company. You could move the page [[Green
    Giant]] to [[Green Giant (company)]], and [[Jolly Green Giant]] to [[Green Giant

    page pointing to the two articles. Any other articles about green giants could
    also be listed. The page [[Jolly Green Giant]] will be automatically turned into

    If Wikipedia has two or more articles about the same topic or with very similar
    content, these articles may need to be merged. Any editor can merge two articles
    by editing them and combining their text on one of the pages and then redirecting
    the other article to the new combined article. If an article gets too long and
    unwieldy or deals with multiple disparate topics, the article may need to be split
    into two or more separate articles. Any editor can do this by creating a new page
    and copying some of the old article's content to the new page. Finally, an article
    may be created using the wrong title or a later decision is made to rename an
    article. In this case, that article needs to be moved to a new title.

    of sorting Wikipedia content, making it more accessible to readers and editors.
    Anyone can help with categorizing pages. Anyone can also create new categories,
    but understanding how the process works ensures your work is consistent with existing
    schemes.

    detailing how they are done and has created several community processes for dealing
    with problem cases.
