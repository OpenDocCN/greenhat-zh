    some money selling them. In this wonderful Internet era, online
    distribution is easy and inexpensive. There are two distinct skill sets
    needed for succeeding at online music distribution: being technically
    adept at creating good recordings in various formats for downloading and
    streaming and understanding the business of being a professional artist,
    which is complex and involves tasks like customer service, contracts, and
    copyright issues. In the first section of this chapter, we’ll learn about
    creating different audio file formats for various purposes, such as
    lower-quality promotional MP3s, streaming audio, and high-quality
    downloads. In the second part, we’ll take a look at the business of being
    a recording artist, which is trickier than being a good musician and
    recording whiz.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="File Formats and Audio Quality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="file_formats_and_audio_quality"/>File Formats and Audio Quality</h1></div></div></div><p>With Audacity it is easy to export your audio files to whatever
      format you want. Let’s take a look at your options. The common
      downloadable formats are AAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and FLAC.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please review <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a>

      iTunes Store. Version 1.3.6 of Audacity introduced support for
      importing, exporting, and converting non-DRM AAC files via FFmpeg. These
      have the M4A (<span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> for audio) file extension. M4P
      files are DRM encumbered. (No, it’s not <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> for
      Pooey, but Protected.)<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Creating files in AAC format in Audacity is easy: Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; Save as type: M4A (AAC) Files
      (FFmpeg) and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>
      button. In the Options dialog, you have a range of quality settings from
      10 to 500, with 500 being the highest quality. This range represents
      Fair, Okay, Good, Better, and Best. The 256 setting is good for a more
      complex recording. A very simple recording, such as one-voice
      spoken-word piece, sounds decent at 50 (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#exporting_to_aac_format_open_parenthesis" title="Figure 8-1. Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format) creates a file with an .m4a extension.">Figure 8-1</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="exporting_to_aac_format_open_parenthesis"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11114"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797635.png.jpg" alt="Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format) creates a file with an .m4a extension."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-1. Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format) creates a

      about them in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Creating Podcasts">Chapter 7</a>. Let’s review the
      ones that are most practical to use. MP3 supports both constant bitrates
      and variable bitrates. Variable bitrates deliver better quality. Your
      online distribution sites will have specific requirements, and with
      Audacity, you can easily tailor your tunes to meet them.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The 128Kbps constant bitrate MP3 is the lowest common denominator
      in the United States. This will play on every digital audio player, and
      some distributors require constant bitrate MP3s for streaming. In
      Audacity, click <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>MP3
      Files</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>Constant</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>128Kbits/sec</strong></span>. The Options dialog gives you a
      wide range of constant bitrates, from 8Kbps to 320Kbps. Although 320Kbps
      is often touted as CD-quality, it isn’t. Your own ears may tell you
      differently, but I can’t hear any improvement over 192Kbps.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some low-bandwidth carriers may require bitrates as low as
        32Kbps for streaming Internet audio. While this may not sound
        wonderful, it expands your potential audience. Half of Internet users
        in the United States are still on dial-up, and many other countries
        still rely on predominantly low-bandwidth Internet services.</p></div><p>Your best Audacity options for variable bitrate MP3s are in the

      Files</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>Variable</strong></span> dialog. Choose your desired
      quality setting, set Variable Speed: Standard and Channel Mode: Stereo
      (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#using_variable_bitrate_settings_for_mp3s" title="Figure 8-2. Using variable bitrate settings for MP3s in Audacity">Figure 8-2</a>). There are
      10 bitrate options in this menu, from 45Kbps to 85Kbps to 220Kbps to
      260Kbps. I like 170Kbps to 210Kbps as a good level for music, and I like
      110Kbps to 150Kbps for simple spoken-word pieces. The Variable Speed
      option limits the variable bitrate to a set range so you can get both
      better quality and some predictability.</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_variable_bitrate_settings_for_mp3s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11181"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797637.png.jpg" alt="Using variable bitrate settings for MP3s in Audacity"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-2. Using variable bitrate settings for MP3s in Audacity</p></div><p>If your distributor supports it, you should also offer Ogg Vorbis
      files for users who don’t care for MP3. They may prefer the higher
      quality of Ogg, or they may using prefer open source,
      patent-unencumbered formats. Ogg Vorbis can be streamed or downloaded
      just like MP3. It delivers high quality at low bitrates and supports
      multichannel surround, while MP3 supports only one or two channels. MP3
      is a closed, proprietary standard chock-full of messy, confusing patent
      conflicts. I haven’t heard of any of the patent holders coming after
      anyone who uses an open source encoder like LAME, which is the preferred
      MP3 encoder to use with Audacity, and I haven’t heard of any small-time
      users getting in trouble for distributing their work in MP3 format. Just
      be aware that it is an issue for some of your fans, and there is a
      possibility it could turn into a problem for you.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Audacity supports Ogg Vorbis, and it is easy to choose your
      quality level. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Ogg Vorbis Files</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>. You get a menu with a little slider
      that lets you choose from 11 quality settings, from 0 to 10. A value of
      3 is roughly equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3. A value of 5 is pretty nice
      for music, with one possible drawback: Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling
      for all levels up to 5. This means that redundancies between two stereo
      channels are combined to save bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of
      stereo imaging. Channel coupling is not used at levels 6 and up. I don’t
      perceive any gain in going above 7, though your ears may tell you
      differently. Ogg Vorbis support is growing fast, and a lot of playback
      devices support it (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#exporting_ot_ogg_vorbis_format" title="Figure 8-3. Exporting ot Ogg Vorbis format">Figure 8-3</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="exporting_ot_ogg_vorbis_format"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11220"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797639.png.jpg" alt="Exporting ot Ogg Vorbis format"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-3. Exporting ot Ogg Vorbis format</p></div><p>FLAC is a wonderful lossless, compressed format that gives
      WAV-quality audio in a smaller file size. FLAC files are typically
      around a third smaller than WAVs. FLACs are great for fans who play
      music from their computers or have computer-based music servers, and an
      increasing number of music players, both home and portable, support
      FLAC. FLAC cannot be streamed but must be downloaded and then
      played.</p><div class="figure"><a id="flac_supports_both_16-and_24-bit"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11230"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797641.png.jpg" alt="FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-4. FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit.</p></div><p>FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit depths and has nine compression
      levels, from 0 to 8 (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#flac_supports_both_16-and_24-bit" title="Figure 8-4. FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit.">Figure 8-4</a>). The default is 5, and
      that is a good one to stick with, though nobody will yell at you for
      experimenting with the others. The different settings are different
      levels of compression, with 0 being the least compression and 8 the
      most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in quality, only in
      how small the files are compressed. A value of 8 takes several times
      longer to encode than 5 with not much additional benefit. Decoding FLAC
      files that have been maximally compressed doesn’t take any longer than
      ones that have been lightly compressed, so the degree of compression
      won’t affect playback.</p><p>WAV is the standard for high-quality uncompressed audio. File
      sizes are large and cannot be streamed, but they are wonderful for your
      fans who want a high-quality file that can easily be converted to other
      formats, such as CD and lower-quality portable formats. And, of course,
      to enjoy for itself. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt;

      select Header: WAV (Microsoft), and then choose your encoding. Select
      either Signed 16 bit PCM or Signed 24 bit PCM. 16-bit is CD quality, and
      24-bit is DVD and studio master quality. Select 24-bit only if your
      original recording is 24-bit or higher.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0023" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="wav_settings_should_be_either_signed_16-"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11274"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797643.png.jpg" alt="WAV settings should be either signed 16-bit or 24-bit."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-5. WAV settings should be either signed 16-bit or 24-bit.</p></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Signed</em></span> means positive integer, which we

      16, 2000, “Courtney Love Does the Math” (<a class="ulink" href="http://salon.com/technology/feature/2000/06/14/love/">http://salon.com/technology/feature/2000/06/14/love/</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Today I want to talk about piracy and music. What is piracy?
        Piracy is the act of stealing an artist’s work without any intention
        of paying for it. I’m not talking about Napster-type
        software.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><p>I’m talking about major label recording contracts.</p></blockquote></div><p>Frank Zappa and Janis Ian have also written or given talks in this

      dumbing everything down for the lowest common denominator. You want to
      work when and where you feel like it and not have other people telling
      you what to do. When someone actually wants to buy your work, you want
      to make it as easy as possible and then keep the money. So, what do you
      do?</p><p>I can’t help you with attaining fame, glory, and groupies. Getting
      noticed is still the hardest part. But I can point you to resources for
      online distribution and tell how to package your recordings for
      different uses such as high-quality audiophile, lo-fi promotional MP3s,
      streaming audio, and CDs.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Establishing an Online Presence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="establishing_an_online_presence"/>Establishing an Online Presence</h1></div></div></div><p>Distribution and promotion and promotion used to be the big
      hurdles for recording artists, and that was why they needed to make
      deals with record companies. Now distribution is easy, thanks to the
      Internet. An Internet distribution strategy has two parts: your own
      personal website and as many music distribution and broadcast sites as
      you can manage. Always have your own personal site with photos, contact
      information, and links to where fans can hear and purchase your music.
      This increases your search engine presence, and it makes it easy for
      fans to find you. Do please resist the urge to make this a typical
      overproduced site full of special effects and animations and dark,
      barely readable color schemes; this guarantees you will chase away your
      visitors. Make it clean, simple, readable, and easy to navigate, because
      nobody cares how self-indulgent your web designer is. They want to know
      about you and how to hear your music, and they don’t want to jump
      through hoops to get there.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0033" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You should have a consistent online identity. The first step to
      building your online identity is to register your own domain name. Don’t
      have an email address or domain name that promotes someone else’s
      business, like <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:carlarockstar@gmail.com">carlarockstar@gmail.com</a></span> or
      <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:guitarcarla@hotmail.com">guitarcarla@hotmail.com</a></span>. Free email addresses are
      seriously uncool anyway. Domain names are cheap, about $15 per year. If
      you change web hosts and email service providers, your domain name will
      always travel with you. Suppose you have a band—let’s say you’re The
      Bandits—and your domain is <a class="ulink" href="http://thebandits.com/">http://thebandits.com/</a>.
      Now you can do all kinds of creative things with the domain name.
      Everyone in your band can have their own email address, such as
      <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:drummer@thebandits.com">drummer@thebandits.com</a></span>,
      <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:diva@thebandits.com">diva@thebandits.com</a></span>, or
      <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:rockgod@thebandits.com">rockgod@thebandits.com</a></span>. No matter what music
      distributors, hosting services, or social networking sites you try,
      <a class="ulink" href="http://thebandits.com/">http://thebandits.com/</a> will always be there for
      your fans to find you.</p><p>There are all kinds of domain name registrars such as Dotster,
      GoDaddy, Register.com, Tucows, and many more. Most web hosting services
      also include domain name registration, but I would keep the two
      separate. Web hosting is a brutal business full of fly-by-nights that
      come and go, and a bad registrar can make it difficult to transfer to
      another registrar, or you can even lose your domain name. The Internet
      Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees domain names
      and maintains a list of accredited registrars (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/accredited-list.html">http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/accredited-list.html</a>).
      This doesn’t guarantee that their customer service or prices are any
      good, just that they are legitimate registrars. WebHostingTalk (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/">http://www.webhostingtalk.com/</a>) is a great source of
      real-world information on hosting services and registrars.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0040" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Think carefully about what kind of contact information to put on
      your sites, because thanks to the magic of the Internet, communications
      can turn into a deep time sink. If you don’t want to spend a lot of time
      answering emails, Tweets, forum posts, and so on, then limit how people
      can reach you. A web form protected by a captcha is a good way to allow
      fans to talk to you without getting buried by spam. Captchas that use
      simple arithmetic problems or multiple-choice questions (“If you are a
      human, click the picture of the puppy.”) are easy and effective. The
      kind that obscure text are annoying and hard for everyone but
      spammers.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0042" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Who is a good web designer design? Someone who listens to you; who
      can explain what they do in plain English (or language of your choice);
      and who favors clean, fast, navigable site design over fancy show-off
      stuff that chases your fans away. Always test your sites on a dial-up
      connection and on a smartphone. Broadband is far from universal, and
      mobile Internet use is exploding, so you need to be tuned in to how your
      site looks and performs on slow connections and on tiny
      screens.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0043" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Remember to also factor in accessibility for vision-impaired
        fans. The United States has an aging population, so it’s good business
        to welcome all of your fans, and accessible design is good design for
        all visitors. If your website designer doesn’t want to bother with
        making your site friendly to all visitors, look for a different
        designer.</p></div><p>Consider having a rented snail mailbox. It’s reliable, it weeds
      out the casual stream-of-consciousness Twitter/email communiques, and it
      ensures that anyone who really wants to talk to you can do so.</p><p>What about MySpace and Facebook? Go for it; they’re free, and
      you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised at who finds you there. Budget
      some time to keep them current. You don’t have to log in every day to
      have deep, meaningful conversations with fans, but definitely make sure
      that links and information about all of your recordings and performances
      are current. It takes time to build a following, so be patient and read
      all of the helpful information that tells you how to get the most
      benefit out of MySpace and Facebook. There are no fast, magic solutions,
      and you shouldn’t believe anyone who tries to sell you some.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0045" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Never ever spam. Do not believe “marketers” who claim they sell
      genuine guaranteed opt-in mail lists full of people who are happy to
      hear from you. This is a lie. You should carefully build your own
      mailing lists. The right way is to have a confirmed opt-in, which means
      when someone signs up, they have to respond to an email that is sent to
      confirm their registration. Make opting out easier than signing up; the
      lesson that marketers and spammers refuse to learn is you can’t force
      people to like you.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0051" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Do be careful—there is no such thing as privacy online.

      compensating artists.</p><p>Magnatune’s (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.magnatune.com/">http://www.magnatune.com/</a>)
      motto is “We are not evil.” They have another motto that I like better:
      “You get great music, musicians get 50%.” That’s 50 percent of sales,
      not profits. Magnatune distributes music in several DRM-free formats:
      streaming only, which is like listening to the radio, downloads in
      various formats, CD, and licenses for commercial use. All music is
      try-before-you-buy, and customers can either select what songs and
      albums they want to hear or listen to various streams. Magnatune
      customers can also get a streaming membership for $15 per month, which
      purchases unlimited listening and downloads with no
      commercials.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0052" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Magnatune supports MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis formats.
      WAV and FLAC are the highest quality, and WAVs can be written to CDs.
      128Kbps MP3s are the lowest quality and are licensed under Creative
      Commons “Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike” license. This grants
      liberal rights for noncommercial uses: sharing, remixes, sampling, and
      covers. Any commercial use is expected to pay money. There is a lot of
      information on the Magnatune website, and they have live humans to talk
      to.</p><p>You retain all copyrights to your own work and can make deals with
      other distributors. Magnatune pays artists every six months, provided
      they have earned at least $100.</p><p>CD Baby (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">http://www.cdbaby.com/</a>) sells both
      DRM-free CDs and MP3 downloads and partners with a number of online
      stories like iTunes and Amazon. It also does bulk CD duplication and
      artwork. CD Baby charges a $35 setup fee per album; this covers
      digitizing the CD, converting tracks into various formats, scanning the
      cover art, and doing other housekeeping chores. You set your own CD
      pricing. CD Baby keeps $4 per disc and 25 percent of download sales.
      Artists are paid weekly. Your CDs will be available through a multitude
      of stores such as Borders and Amazon.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0054" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CD Baby offers a nice service for live shows—its Credit Card
      Swiper Program. This is a credit/debit card terminal that you can take
      to shows and set up on your merchandise table. CD Baby takes a 12.8
      percent cut. This sounds like a lot, but having your own merchant credit
      card account is expensive. It will cost you a monthly fee whether you
      sell anything or not, plus a percentage of every sale, usually around
      2.5 to 3 percent per swiped transaction. If you sell your CDs on your
      merchandise tables, CD Baby takes 12.8 percent instead of the usual $4
      cut.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0056" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CD Baby offers a number of other artist services such as Host Baby
      (web hosting), stickers and cards, and a booking service.</p><p>eMusic (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.emusic.com/">http://www.emusic.com/</a>) is a
      well-regarded DRM-free MP3 online music store that is a treasure trove
      of good indie bands and mainstream popular music. However, they don’t
      accept just anyone; they work with established music labels, so you need
      to already be signed on with someone. eMusic is all corporate and
      lawyerly and full of bureaucracy. It’s probably a better deal for music
      fans than for little-known musicians, though it never hurts to check it
      out.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0057" class="indexterm"/></p><p>TuneCore (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tunecore.com/">http://www.tunecore.com/</a>) has a
      flat-rate system. You pay $9.99 per song plus a $9.99 annual maintenance
      fee, or $49.99 per album the first year and $19.98 for each year
      thereafter, plus $19.98 annual maintenance. This gets you into 19 online
      stores including Amazon MP3, eMusic, Rhapsody, and Spotify. They also
      have an Amazon: Disc On Demand option for selling CDs. There is a
      two-month lag on sales reporting from most stores, and TuneCore reports
      twice per month. After that, you can withdraw your funds any time. (It
      requires a PayPal account.)<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0058" class="indexterm"/></p><p>iTunes (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/content-providers/faq.html">http://www.apple.com/itunes/content-providers/faq.html</a>)
      is the big show. There are significant hoops to jump through, but
      nothing ventured, nothing gained. CD Baby, TuneCore, and SongCast all
      partner with iTunes, which is easier than applying directly to
      iTunes.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0059" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Independent Online Distribution Alliance (IODA) (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.iodalliance.com/">http://www.iodalliance.com/</a>) acts as a collective agent
      and aggregator, using the power of collective bargaining to give
      independents a stronger business voice. In return for a percentage of
      artists’ royalties, it handles rate negotiations, reporting,
      distribution of works, distribution of royalties, and other grotty but
      necessary business chores.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0060" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Independent online distribution is a growing business, and you can
      find many more distribution sites. Promotion is up to you, though every
      site provides useful tools and advice to help you. Don’t be a typical
      clueless artist and sign your life away or hook up with some rip-off
      artist. Researching distributors is as easy as sitting down at your
      computer and doing some web searches. Don’t forget the gnarly business
      of taxes and reading the fine print. When will you get paid? How can you
      verify sales and payment records? Copyrights, DRM, closing your account,
      making changes, getting help from real live humans, and dispute
      resolution are all important things to look at.</p><p>Consider choosing distributors by genre, rather than popularity.
      Sure, iTunes and Amazon are the big gorillas, but if your niche is
      sophisticated jazz, dance music, world music, or some such, look for a
      distributor that specializes in your type of music.</p><p>It is good to maintain a professional, businesslike approach and
      remember mundane details such as keeping your word; contact information;
      correct spelling, grammar and punctuation; readable fonts; and
      nice-looking artwork. Nobody cares how much you artistically
      suffer.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Self-Hosting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="self-hosting"/>Self-Hosting</h1></div></div></div><p>Another option is to self-host, which means running your own
      servers. These here modern times are not like the olden days of Bulletin
      Board Services (BBS) when thousands of people ran their own BBS servers
      from PCs in their bedrooms. Maintaining a website, hosting your own
      downloads, and offering streams of your work are all feasible for the
      do-it-yourselfer but are not for the faint of heart or the technophobe.
      Bandwidth is the biggest problem: If you want to house your servers in
      your home, first find out whether you can get adequate bandwidth for a
      reasonable price and whether your Internet service provider will even
      allow you to run servers. Then you are responsible for your own
      security, software, hardware, and system and network administration. It
      is satisfying to be the boss of your own servers, but it does require a
      lot of skills.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0066" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A better option is to use a good hosting service that has all the
      tools you need and gives you a good deal on bandwidth. It’s hard to beat
      a good hosting service on bandwidth cost, since they buy in bulk and
      spread the cost over many customers. Then the hosting service handles
      hardware problems, Internet connectivity, security, and backup power.
      Plans range from free for a basic low-traffic site to inexpensive shared
      hosting (which means one server with a limited amount of Internet
      bandwidth serves many customers) to paying for your own dedicated,
      unshared server. You can get started cheaply and upgrade as you become
      more successful.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Remember WebHosting Talk (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/">http://www.webhostingtalk.com/</a>) for learning which
        hosts are good and which ones to avoid.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0067" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>The free/open source software world has everything you need for
      running your own websites. Use the Linux operating system because it is
      robust and secure. Then there are bales of great servers to choose
      from:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Drupal, Joomla, Mambo, and Plone are all examples of excellent
          open source content management systems (CMS). These are the
          frameworks for the content that you want to put on your site so you
          can easily organize and post articles, photos, calendars, news,
          forums, and links.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0068" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0069" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0070" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0071" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0072" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Icecast and Campcaster are excellent open source streaming Ogg
          Vorbis and MP3 servers that you can embed on your website.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0073" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0074" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Shoutcast is a closed, proprietary streaming server, and
          Shoutcast Radio is a fast and free Internet broadcast service for
          hosting your streams. You can also embed Shoutcast streams in your
          other sites.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0075" class="indexterm"/></p></li></ul></div><p>Many web hosting services offer Icecast and Shoutcast streaming
      and, of course, many other streaming media servers. Any hosting service
      offers a big bundle of server software and a nice graphical control
      panel for everything. If they don’t have a particular piece of software,
      ask whether they will install it, and if the software is free-of-cost
      open source, they probably will. Most hosting services rely heavily on
      open source software because it is free or inexpensive and because it is
      good.</p><div class="sect2" title="Selling Stuff Online"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="selling_stuff_online"/>Selling Stuff Online</h2></div></div></div><p>Selling things online can be as simple as having a website and a
        PayPal account for accepting payments or a mailing address for checks
        and money orders. Check and money order fraud are rampant to the point
        that it may not be worth accepting either one. PayPal is easy and
        popular; just be sure you understand its fee structure so you don’t
        get surprised at the myriad ways it nibbles away chunks of your money.
        Google Checkout has lower fees than PayPal and doesn’t have PayPal’s
        reputation for inconsistent, unfair dispute resolution. You can use
        both, which will capture more customers since many of them will not
        want to sign up for one when they already have an account at the
        other.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0079" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0080" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0081" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0082" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0083" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Processing online credit card payments requires a sophisticated
        infrastructure. You don’t want to be one of those shops that makes
        headlines when some teenager hacks your customer database and steals
        all the information. Consider using a prefab storefront that has all
        the payment processing already in place. Start at Amazon.com (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazonservices.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm">http://www.amazonservices.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm</a>);
        it is reputable and reliable, and it posts all of its prices and
        policies, so it’s a good starting point for research and comparisons.
        Amazon does not directly sell independent music but partners with
        music distributors like CD Baby and TuneCore. Having an Amazon
        storefront might be a good venue for your band swag and getting more
        visibility and another way to generate CD orders.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0084" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0085" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can avoid payment hassles by hosting only free downloads and
        streaming on your personal site and then linking to your wares on CD
        Baby, Songcast, or whatever distributors you are hooked up
        with.</p><p>The one piece that almost everyone forgets is customer service.
        How are customers going to contact you when they have questions or
        problems, phone? Email? Who is going to respond, and can you count on
        them to respond quickly and in a way that keeps customers happy? If
        you are selling physical items like CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, and other
        branded merchandise, who is going to pack and ship them and how fast?
        Customer service is everything. It costs at least ten times more to
        acquire a new customer than to keep an existing customer happy, no
        matter how great your artistic genius.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0086" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="To DRM or Not to DRM?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="to_drm_or_not_to_drm_question"/>To DRM or Not to DRM?</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Digital rights management (DRM)</em></span>, or as some
      prefer to call it, digital restrictions management, means copy
      protection, and the various technologies designed to prevent illegal
      copying. The concept might sound good, since the idea of people copying
      your music for free sounds like a rip-off. But in practice it’s a
      nightmare. It doesn’t even slow down big-time pirates who reproduce and
      sell thousands of copies of movies and music CDs. It doesn’t stop the
      clever kids who want something for nothing. It mainly gets in the way of
      legitimate paying customers.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0087" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It adds an intolerable overhead burden to online distribution,
      because this requires always-available authentication servers. Already
      this is falling apart after just a few years. Wal-Mart announced in
      September 2008 that it was going to shut down its DRM authentication
      servers, which meant that customers would not be able to play their
      DRM-“protected” music that they had purchased if they tried to move it
      to a different machine or restore from a system failure. Wal-Mart’s
      remedy was for customers to copy their DRM-“protected” tracks to CDs,
      which would then play anywhere. There was such an outcry that they
      changed their plans and still maintain their DRM servers. Even though
      they have moved to DRM-free distribution, that old DRM baggage is going
      to haunt them for a long time.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0088" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0089" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0090" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0091" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0092" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Apple’s iTunes store went DRM-free in February 2008, and existing
      DRM-protected files can be converted to DRM-free versions for 30 cents
      per song or 30 percent of the album price. (Thank you for the
      opportunity to pay twice.) Yahoo! and Rhapsody have also moved away from
      DRM. Amazon and EMI moved in and captured a dominant chunk of the music
      market by offering DRM-free tracks from the beginning.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0093" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0094" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are a sizable number of doofy DRM schemes that make me
      wonder why some people get paychecks for coming up with these
      brainstorms, while we sensible people have to scramble for our daily
      bread. Sony BMG got busted not once but twice for sneakily installing
      cloaked rootkits on Windows computers from “protected” music CDs. Not
      only was this a trespass that would have been criminally prosecuted if
      it were some kid instead of a globalcorp, it opened big security holes
      in these computers. Other brilliant DRM ideas that went over like lead
      balloons were time-bombed music tracks that became unplayable after a
      certain number of days, attempts to count and limit the numbers of
      copies that could be made, and downloads that became unplayable when
      subscriptions expired. All of these depend on some kind of central
      authorization and control, which to my way of thinking requires
      unwarranted intrusions into our personal business and a level of
      reliability that few service providers can sustain. I have vinyl LPs
      that are older than me—how long do you think digital tracks will survive
      even without DRM monkeyshines? I can’t fathom the mind-set that can come
      up with these sort of hostile, self-defeating Big Brother
      tactics.</p><p>On the other hand, having your work poached is no good either.
      Recording artists have a right to get paid for their recorded works; I
      don’t think much of the folks who say, “Give your recordings away and
      earn money giving live performances.” Apparently they have never
      performed or created a good recording. I don’t have any wisdom to offer
      except to treat your paying customers as well as you can. In real life,
      and not the bizarro world inhabited by the entertainment industry
      barons, most people will treat you fairly if you treat them fairly and
      do the right thing because it’s the right thing, not because they are
      forced to.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Copyrights and Legal Issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="copyrights_and_legal_issues"/>Copyrights and Legal Issues</h1></div></div></div><p>Copyright law is in a seriously weird place right now in the
      United States and some other countries as well. The rights of copyright
      owners keep getting extended, while fair use is taking a beating, and
      minor infringements are escalated into major crimes. Creators are pushed
      out as the rights holders to their own works, though that is an old,
      chronic problem. As Courtney Love said in “Courtney Love Does the
      Math”:<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0095" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>. . . a congressional aide named Mitch Glazier, with the support
        of the RIAA, added a “technical amendment” to a bill that defined
        recorded music as “works for hire” under the 1978 Copyright
        Act.</p><p>He did this after all the hearings on the bill were over. By the
        time artists found out about the change, it was too late. The bill was
        on its way to the White House for the president’s signature.</p><p>That subtle change in copyright law will add billions of dollars
        to record company bank accounts over the next few years—billions of
        dollars that rightfully should have been paid to artists. A “work for
        hire” is now owned in perpetuity by the record company.</p><p>Under the 1978 Copyright Act, artists could reclaim the
        copyrights on their work after 35 years. If you wrote and recorded
        “Everybody Hurts,” you at least got it back to as a family legacy
        after 35 years. But now, because of this corrupt little pisher,
        “Everybody Hurts” never gets returned to your family, and can now be
        sold to the highest bidder.</p><p>. . . By the way, which bill do you think the recording industry
        used for this amendment? . . . How about the Satellite Home Viewing
        Act of 1999?</p></blockquote></div><p>That charming little provision was overturned retroactively in The
      Work Made for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000. But you see
      what you’re up against. One way to take matters into your own hands is
      to release your works under a Creative Commons license. There are
      several of them, and you can read all about them at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">http://www.creativecommons.org/</a>. These allow you to
      define different degrees of permissions for reuse and distribution, from
      permissive to restrictive. When you look for legal advice, be sure that
      you find an attorney who is well versed in all aspects of copyright law,
      including Creative Commons.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0096" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0097" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Note that I said, “when you look for legal advice,” not “if.” The
      Internet is already full of nonlawyers trading legal advice, so do
      yourself a favor and find a real lawyer to advise you. You can find all
      kinds of information online and at the library, and then when you meet
      with an attorney, you’ll be well prepared. Unfortunately, this is a
      necessary part of being an artist in these modern times. You can live on
      beans and rice, you can patch old clothes, and you can drive an old car
      held together with wire and tape. But undoing legal messes is difficult,
      expensive, and often not possible; prevention is much cheaper and
      considerably less stressful.</p></div>
