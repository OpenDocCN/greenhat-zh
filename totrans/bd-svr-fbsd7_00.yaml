    format. The book consists of two parts: [Part I](the_base_system_split_000.html#the_base_system),
    "The Base System," and [Part II](third-party_applications_split_000.html#third-party_applications),

    on installing the FreeBSD operating system. This section of the book also contains
    important information on setting up your base FreeBSD environment and updating
    the ports collection. If you need more information on the FreeBSD operating system,
    consult the FreeBSD Handbook. It is an invaluable resource and can be found on
    the Web at [http://freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook](http://freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook).'

    are divided into individual modules that are arranged alphabetically, minimizing

- en: The applications covered in this book were carefully selected. A balance between
    stability and available support were determining factors in choosing which applications
    would be included. Stability is paramount in server environments. Community support
    is also very important for long-term viability of an application; a well-supported
    application means that resources will be available to you if you need help. Community
    support also encourages development efforts, which may lead to faster responses
    to bugs or security issues.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The direction "become the superuser" is used throughout the book, and I want
    to clarify its meaning early on. The term superuser is synonymous with the root
    account on other UNIX-like systems. The root account is a special user account
    that has full administrative rights to the system. Most of the modules in this
    book require you to execute commands as the superuser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To become the superuser, you can log in at the console (using the console means
    you are using the monitor and keyboard attached to the system) with the username
    root. There may be times when you need to log in remotely via SSH (Secure Shell).
    For security reasons, FreeBSD does not allow the root user to log in via SSH.
    You must first log in as a normal user, then switch to the superuser account with
    the `su` command. Only user accounts that belong to the wheel group may switch
    to the superuser account. The FreeBSD module in this book explains how to add
    your initial user to the wheel group during the installation process. If you don''t
    follow that module or if you want to verify your group memberships, log in and

    contents of various text configuration files. These configuration files dictate
    how the system behaves, so the ability to edit them is critical. FreeBSD includes
    ee (Easy Editor), which is easy to learn and has the basic functionality needed
    to perform administrative tasks. To start Easy Editor, simply type `**ee**` at
