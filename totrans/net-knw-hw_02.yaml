  zh: 每台连接到网络的计算机都必须遵循一组规则和规范，这些规则和规范定义了物理连接的特性以及从一台计算机传输到另一台计算机的数据的形式和结构。没有这些规则，使用网络的人们无法确保他们的计算机能够成功通信。
- en: For example, the plugs at the ends of data cables must match the sockets on
    each computer and other network hardware. If a cable uses a square plug with two
    pins, but the computer has a round socket with four holes, they won't fit together.
    The same thing applies to the electrical voltages, timing, error checking, and
    other issues. There are many different kinds of networks, each with its own rules.
    This chapter explains a few general principles about networks and describes the
    network types that you're most likely to see in a home or small office network.

- en: The form that each 1 or 0 takes is different in different types of communication
    channels. It could be a light, sound, or electrical charge that is either on or
    off; a series of long and short sounds or light flashes; or two different audio
    tones, electrical voltages, or radio frequencies. In a very simple system, the
    1 might correspond to "yes" and the 0 to "no," or any other pair of options.

- en: Individual bits only offer two options, so they're not particularly useful,
    but when you string eight of them together (into a *byte*), you can have 256 different
    combinations (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2). That's enough to assign a different
    sequence to every letter of the alphabet (both upper- and lowercase), the ten
    digits from 0 to 9, spaces between words, and other symbols such as punctuation
    marks and many letters used in foreign alphabets. A byte is the basic building
    block of computer communication. The most widely used coding system for converting
    bytes to characters is called *ASCII* (American Standard Code for Information
    Interchange). [Figure 2-1](ch02.html#these_bits_form_the_ascii_sequence_of_a "Figure 2-1. These
    bits form the ASCII sequence of A (01000001) and n (01101110).") shows a typical

    information to digital data. For example, it can divide every second of sound
    from a microphone or an analog recording into thousands of very short segments
    and use 16 or 24 bits to specify the content of each segment, or divide a picture
    into millions of individual points (called *pixels*, short for *picture elements*)
    and use a series of bits to specify the color of each bit.

- en: A wire or other data link can carry only one bit at a time. Either there's a
    signal on the line or there isn't. Over short distances, it's possible to send
    the data through a cable that carries eight (or some multiple of eight) signals
    in *parallel* through eight separate wires. Obviously, a parallel connection can
    be eight times faster than sending one bit at a time through a single wire, but
    those eight wires cost eight times as much as a single wire. That added cost is
    insignificant when the wires extend only a foot or two, but the additional cost
    of parallel wires can add up quickly when you're trying to send the data over
    a long distance. And when you're using existing circuits such as telephone lines,
    you don't have any choice; you must find a way to send one bit at a time, with
    some additional bits and pauses that identify the beginning of each new byte.
    This is a *serial* data communications channel, because you're sending the bits
    one after another. At this stage, it doesn't matter what medium you use to transmit
    those bits—it could be electrical impulses on a wire, or two different audio tones,
    or a series of flashing lights, or even a lot of notes attached to the legs of
    carrier pigeons—but you must have a way to convert the text or other output of
    the computer to the signals used by the transmission medium, and to convert the
    same signals back again at the other end.

- en: Communication over a direct physical connection (such as a wire) between a single
    origin and destination doesn't need any kind of address or routing information
    to tell a message where to go. You might have to set up the connection first (by
    placing a telephone call or plugging cables into a switchboard), but after you're
    connected, the link remains in place until you instruct the system to disconnect.
    This kind of connection is great for voice and for simple data links, but it's
    not particularly efficient for digital data on a complex network that serves many
    origins and destinations, because a single connection ties up the circuit all
    the time, even when no data is moving through the channel.

- en: The alternative is to send your message to a switching center that will hold
    it until a link to the destination becomes available. This is known as a *store
    and forward* system. If the network has been properly designed for the type of
    data and the amount of traffic in the system, the waiting time will be insignificant.
    If the communications network covers a lot of territory, you can forward the message
    to one or more intermediate switching centers before it reaches the ultimate destination.

- en: To make the network even more efficient, you can divide messages that are longer
    than some arbitrary limit into separate pieces, called *packets* or *frames*.
    Packets from more than one message can alternate with packets containing other
    messages as they travel between switching centers, and reassemble themselves into

    circuits on an as-available basis. The packets from a single message might alternate
    with packets from one or more other messages as they move through parts of the

    of the packet''s destination, the sequence order of this packet relative to other
    packets in the original transmission, and so forth. Some of this information provides

    packet) attached to each packet include the address of the packet's destination,
    information that allows the recipient to confirm that the packet's content is
    accurate, and information that the recipient uses to reassemble the packets in
    the original order. Between the origin and the destination, network routing equipment
    sometimes adds more headers or trailers that contain routing instructions and

    communications system. Each layer may attach additional information to the original
    message and strip off that information after it has done whatever the added information
    instructed it to do. By the time a message travels from a laptop computer on a
    wireless network through an office network and a gateway to the Internet, and
    onward to a distant computer connected to another local network, a dozen or more
    information attachments might be added and removed before the recipient reads
    the original text. A package of data that includes address and control information
    ahead of the bits that contain the content of the message, followed by an error-checking
    sequence, is called a *frame*. Both wired and wireless networks divide the data
    stream into frames that contain various forms of handshaking information along
    with the original data.

    be absolutely identical to the one that comes out at the other end. But in the
    real world, there's almost always some kind of noise along the line that can interfere
    with the original signal. *Noise* is defined as anything that interrupts or is
    added to the original signal; it could be caused by a lightning strike, interference
    from another communications channel, devices not working correctly, or dirt on
    an electrical contact someplace in the circuit (or in the case of carrier pigeons,
    an attack by a marauding hawk). Whatever the source, noise in the channel can
    interrupt the flow of data. In a modern communications system, those bits are
    pouring through the circuit extremely quickly—millions of them every second—so
    a noise hit for even a fraction of a second can obliterate enough bits to turn
    your data into digital gibberish.

- en: Therefore, your data stream must include a process called *error checking*.
    Error checking is accomplished by adding some kind of standard information to
    each byte. In a simple computer data network, the handshaking information is called
    the *parity bit*, which tells the device receiving each byte whether the sum of
    the ones and zeroes inside the byte is odd or even. This value is called a *checksum*.
    If the receiving device discovers that the parity bit is not correct, it instructs
    the transmitter to send the same byte again. More complex networks, including
    wireless systems, include additional error-checking handshaking data with each
    string of data.

    through a computer data network is part of the original block of information that
    arrived at the input computer. In a complex network such as a wireless data channel,
    as much as 40 percent or more of the transmitted data is handshaking and other
    overhead. It's all essential, but every one of those bits increases the amount
    of time that the message needs to move through the network.

    Every time a network node is ready to transmit a frame, it checks if another frame
    is already using the network; if the network is clear, the node sends the frame.
    But if the node detects that another frame is using the network (a condition called
    a *collision*), it waits a random period of time before it tries again. CSMA/CD

- en: Wi-Fi (short for *wireless fidelity*) is a category of networks that use radio
    signals instead of wires to connect computers and other devices. Another name
    for Wi-Fi is *wireless Ethernet*, because Wi-Fi uses many of the same data-handling
    rules and specifications as a wired Ethernet network. However, every Wi-Fi packet
    must include additional handshaking data, so the overall data transfer speed is
    often slower than a conventional Ethernet link.

    Rather than string cables through walls and provide a network outlet at every
    desk, you can distribute access to the network through antennas in between each
    computer and a base station (an *access point*) in a central location. When you
    travel with a laptop computer, a handheld PDA (personal digital assistant), or
    a mobile Internet device, such as a BlackBerry or an iPhone, you can often connect
    it to the Internet via Wi-Fi by simply turning it on.'

    transformer that feeds your house wiring also isolates your data network from

    connection point. It's also more secure than Wi-Fi, and it can reach greater distances
    than a Wi-Fi network with just one base station. Wi-Fi signals are often blocked
    by thick walls and other obstacles that make no difference to a powerline system.

    one computer to the output on the other computer, and the input to the input,
    so neither computer will actually receive any data. Therefore, you must flip the
    connections, so each output connects to an input. A cable or adapter that connects
    output pins to input pins is called a *null modem*. [Figure 2-6](ch02s06.html#a_null_modem_adapter_or_cable_connects

- en: A server can be a separate computer that runs only specialized server software,
    a general-purpose computer that runs server programs along with other programs,
    or an even more specialized device that contains a special-purpose internal computer
    processor. For example, as [Figure 2-12](ch02s10.html#a_printer_server_can_be_either_a_comput
    "Figure 2-12. A printer server can be either a computer with a printer connected
    to it or a dedicated printer server.") shows, a printer server could be a computer
    with a printer attached to it, or a printer with an internal or external network
    adapter connected directly to the network.

- en: In a small network, it's not unusual for the same computer to double as a client
    and a server. For example, in a home network, the family's printer might be located
    in the kitchen, where Mom has a computer on which she keeps the family's financial
    records and looks up recipes on the Internet. The kitchen computer is the network's
    printer server. When others in the house want to print something, they instruct
    their own computer to send it to the printer through the network to the computer
    in the kitchen. The computers' operating systems know how to handle such print
    requests without interrupting other programs running on the printer server.

- en: Clients and servers are important because they are essential network building
    blocks. A client-and-server structure is often the very best way to add services
    to a network because it's an efficient way to share expensive hardware and software,
    and it makes those services equally accessible to everybody.
