    in the center of the selected object or objects. This is the center of rotation.
    This point is remembered for each object and is one of its permanent properties;
    moving any object’s center is an undoable action, and when you save the document,
    the rotation centers of all objects are saved with it. Scaling, rotation, or skewing
    are performed around this point not only with the Selector tool but in most other
    places as well (such as in the **Transform** dialog or when transforming by keyboard

    of an object. With the Selector tool, you can freely drag it to any point (inside
    or outside the object itself). While being dragged, the center snaps to the edges
    of the object’s bounding box, to the geometric center (its original location),
    and to the horizontal and vertical axes going through the geometric center. This
    makes it easy to quickly snap the rotation center back into the default position
    or to a corner of the bounding box. Drag it with ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg)

    band or by ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735370.png.jpg)). If that
    first or bottommost object ever had its rotation center moved away from the default

    the rightmost selected object is displaced by 5*n* px, where *n* is the number

    which applies the same “soft brush” metaphor not only to transforming objects
    but also to styling them (**[8.7 Color Tweaking](ch08s07.html "8.7 Color Tweaking")**)
    and editing paths (**[12.6 Path Tweaking](ch12s06.html "12.6 Path Tweaking")**).
    This tool has a number of *modes*; in this chapter, we will cover those modes
    that deal with transforming, duplicating, and deleting objects. Using these modes,
    it is easy to sweep, sculpt, and scatter collections of objects, such as clone
    tilings, into complex and naturalistic images—to *draw with scattering*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All modes of the Tweak tool share a number of common features. No matter which
    mode you’re in, you use a circular soft-edged brush (the orange circle you see
    under the cursor) controlled by the **Width** and **Force** parameters on the
    controls bar and affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive
    tablet). You “paint” with this brush over the selected objects to change them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *width* of the brush varies from 1 to 100, but these aren’t absolute units;
    regardless of zoom, 1 gives you a very small brush and 100 gives you a brush approximately
    the size of your screen. In this tool, you will always see the circular brush
    outline centered on your mouse cursor and demonstrating the current width of the
    brush. You can change this value by using the **Width** control on the toolbar
    or the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735586.png.jpg) (narrower) and
    ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735588.png.jpg) (wider) keys. The brush
    is soft; its action is maximum in the center and smoothly decreases towards the
    edge following a bell-like profile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, *force* ranges from 1 (very weak; you need to stroke an object several
    times to achieve a visible effect) to 100 (very strong; the first stroke of the
    brush applies the maximum effect under the brush). To change the force, use the
    toolbar control or press the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735592.png.jpg)

    clones, but you can also start with a single ellipse or path and manually duplicate
    (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg)) or clone (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735630.png.jpg))
    it several times, dragging away the copies. Now, select all the objects you created,
    switch to the Tweak tool, adjust **Width** so the circle covers several objects
    at once, set **Force** to a moderate value of 20, enable one of the modes by its
    toggle button, and start dragging over the objects. [Figure 6-16](ch06s09.html#transforming_a_scattering_of_semitranspa

- en: As with the regular **Duplicate** command (**[4.4 Copying, Cutting, Pasting,
    and Duplicating](ch04s04.html "4.4 Copying, Cutting, Pasting, and Duplicating")**),
    duplicating with the Tweak tool places the copies right over the originals, so
    it is a good idea to use the Jitter mode after duplicating to ruffle them apart.
    The duplicates created by the tool are automatically added to selection if the
    original objects were selected (e.g., if you’re tweaking a group of objects, they
    are duplicated within that group and are not by themselves selected).

    look closer at what exactly gets transformed when you do it. As it turns out,
    Inkscape can optionally affect or not affect some specific parts of objects. This
    is controlled by the **Affect** toggle buttons on the right end of the Selector

    skewing. When this button is on, any scaled object that has stroke (**[8.1.1 Paint](ch08s01.html#eightdot1dot1_paint
    "8.1.1 Paint")**) will have the width of the stroke scaled by the corresponding
    ratio. For example, if you scale an object with a 2-px wide stroke to twice its
    current size and this button is on, the resulting object will have 4-px wide stroke.
    If the button is off, it will have the same unchanged stroke width of 2 px.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you scale an object without preserving the aspect ratio, with the **Affect
    stroke width** button on, stroke gets scaled by the square root of the product
    of vertical and horizontal scale ratios. For example, if you scale an object to
    twice its width horizontally but leave its height unchanged, the stroke becomes
    wider by a factor of 1.415 (the square root of 2).
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping stroke width unscaled is more commonly useful. For example, in a plan
    or draft, you normally want all your objects to have the same fixed stroke width,
    unaffected by scaling, so there you would toggle this button off. It only makes
    sense to toggle this button on when you use stroke as a purely visual element
    (such as brush-like strokes in a freehand drawing).

    (**[11.2.2 Rounding](ch11s02.html#one1dot2dot2_rounding "11.2.2 Rounding")**).
    When it’s on, a rectangle is scaled as a whole, just as it would be scaled if
    converted to path; this may lead to the rounded corner becoming larger, smaller,
    and/or nonround. When it’s off, Inkscape preserves the rounded corners exactly
    as they were. This can be useful, for example, in a flowchart diagram where you
    want all your boxes to have the same rounded corners independent of their sizes.

- en: This button controls whether transformations are applied to the gradients in
    objects’ fills or strokes (**[10.1 The Gradient Tool](ch10s01.html "10.1 The Gradient
    Tool")**). Since gradients (more precisely, positions of gradient stops) can be
    moved, rotated, and skewed as well as scaled, this button applies to any kind
    of transformations. When it’s on, the gradient stops are transformed as a whole
    with the object carrying the gradient. When it’s off, the gradient stays glued
    to the canvas (unchanged in position, direction, or scale) while the object is
    transformed.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, with this button toggled off, it is possible to move an object
    beyond its own gradient, or scale it up so that more of the gradient becomes visible.
    This is useful when the gradient’s position is exactly coordinated with other
    objects in your drawing, while the object itself is simply a “window” onto that
    gradient, and you want to move or adjust the edges of that window without touching
    the gradient itself.
