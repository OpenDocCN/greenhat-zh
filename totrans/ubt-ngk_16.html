Ubuntu is quite capable in terms of video playback, allowing you to view video files you download from the Internet or from your digital movie camera, video CDs (VCDs), DVDs, and some Internet video streams. It even allows you to download movies from your digital video camera and then edit them.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1334" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1335" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="DVDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="dvds"/>DVDs</h1></div></div></div><p>Your system allows you to play DVDs; however, due to licensing concerns, playback is limited to unencrypted discs by default. Unfortunately, this rules out a vast majority of the DVD movies you buy or rent at your local video shop and leaves you with a rather limited choice of movies that you can play on your computer. Given the limited offerings in the unencrypted DVD world, you will no doubt want to enable your system to play the encrypted variety.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Project 16A: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_16a_colon_installing_support_for"/>Project 16A: Installing Support for Encrypted DVDs</h1></div></div></div><p>As I already mentioned, Ubuntu does not allow you to play encrypted DVDs from the start. For you to watch such DVDs (and that would be the vast majority of them), you need to install a whole bunch of stuff, most crucially, the package <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdread4</em></span>. Fortunately, if you installed the audio support files I mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. TUX ROCKS">Chapter 14</a>, you're halfway there. If you didn't install them or if you just want to double-check, start by running the Ubuntu Software Center, and then make sure you have those files and a few useful others installed. If anything is missing, install it. Here's what you need to have:<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1336" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1337" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1338" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gst-plugins-base</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-good</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gst-ffmpeg</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdread4</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Now you've come to the final and essential step required for this project. For this task, you're going to have to turn to the trusty ol' Terminal (<span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>). Once the Terminal is open, type the following command, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting16_d1e20807"/><pre class="programlisting">sudo apt-get install libdvdread4</pre><p>With just about any other application, you would be done at this point, but libdvdread4 requires you to also run an installation script that comes with it in order to fully get the job done. To run the script, go back to the Terminal, type the following, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting16_d1e20814"/><pre class="programlisting">sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh</pre><p>Once the Terminal returns you to the user prompt, the process will be done. Try putting a DVD in your drive—Totem should open and start playing the DVD. (You'll learn more about Totem soon.) If it doesn't work, open the Ubuntu Software Center, and check to make sure all the support plug-ins listed earlier are installed. If everything is there, go back to the Terminal, and perform the last two steps again.</p><div class="sect2" title="Can I Play Foreign DVDs?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="can_i_play_foreign_dvds_question"/>Can I Play Foreign DVDs?</h2></div></div></div><p>Your computer can play DVDs of any broadcast standard (NTSC, PAL, or SECAM) and of any regional encoding. This is a better setup than the DVD player you have hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of stand-alone DVD players in the United States (I would venture to guess 99.9 percent) do not allow you to play anything other than Region 1 NTSC discs (NTSC being the broadcast standard in the United States and what its televisions are designed to display, while the DVD region is 1). This information is usually provided on the back of DVD packages (see the examples in <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on" title="Figure 16-1. Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages">Figure 16-1</a>), though the packaging for most discs produced for the U.S. market does not include it.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1339" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1340" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e20834"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656593.png.jpg" alt="Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-1. Examples of regional encoding labels on DVD packages</p></div><p>Despite the wonderful everything-goes nature of your computer in terms of DVD playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the manufacturer of your DVD drive, you will be able to switch back and forth between DVDs of differing regional encodings only four or five times. After that, the drive will be locked into the regional encoding of the disc you were playing at that time . . . <span class="emphasis"><em>forever</em></span>. This is unrelated to your operating system—it is strictly a hardware matter. The only exception to this region-lock rule are those DVDs labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>Region Free</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>ALL</em></span> (sometimes inaccurately labeled as <span class="emphasis"><em>Region 0</em></span>), which can be played on any DVD player in any region and thus do not register as a regional encoding switch when you plop one of them in your computer's DVD drive.</p><p>If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially one for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That news comes in the form of Videolan's <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdcss2</em></span>, the library that is included in the libdvdread4 package you installed in Project 16A.The libdvdcss2 library allows you to play back encrypted DVDs. In addition to that primary function, <span class="emphasis"><em>libdvdcss2</em></span> also, in theory, allows you to play back DVDs from multiple regions even if your DVD drive is already locked into one region. It does this by performing a cryptic attack (to use Videolan's term for it) on your drive until it can find the disc key for that drive. Of course, this process of cryptic bombardment can take several minutes, so it is not the optimal way of going about things. It's better than being stuck, though. Whether this process of bypassing regional encodings is legal remains a subject of debate, so if you are concerned about such things, you should do a little research.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1341" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>

It really is little more than a movie editor, allowing you only to trim and combine video clips. Some of its greatest limitations are its inability to capture video from digital video cameras or video streams, its inability to apply transitions or effects to videos, and, to top it all off, its inability to add titles to videos. Although these features are promised for the future, the fact that they are not available now makes the decision to bundle PiTiVi with Ubuntu a rather peculiar one.</p><p>Limitations and peculiarities aside, the actual editing process in PiTiVi is relatively straightforward. First you start a new project and decide its name and settings (<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span>). Then you add files to that project, either by dragging and dropping from your home folder to the PiTiVi window or by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Import clips</strong></span> button and then selecting the files you want to add via the Import a clip window that appears. The files, now called <span class="emphasis"><em>clips</em></span>, will then appear in the Clip Library pane of the PiTiVi window. From that pane, you can drag the clips you want to work on to the timeline below and then split the clips, delete the embarrassing or boring bits out, and combine files (<a class="xref" href="ch16s05.html#editing_video_with_pitivi" title="Figure 16-7. Editing video with PiTiVi">Figure 16-7</a>).

When you want to transfer a video clip to your computer from a digital video (DV) camera that saves its data on tape or from a video stream, however, there is no way to simply drag it from one place to another. You have to capture the video stream to disk while you play it, and to do that you need some sort of software solution. This is usually found in the form of the system's video editor; however, as I mentioned in the previous section, Ubuntu's bundled video editor, PiTiVi, is not yet capable of doing this. This means you will have to install another editor, and the old-time favorite for this is Kino (<a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html#another_digital_video_editor_comma_kino" title="Figure 16-8. Another digital video editor, Kino">Figure 16-8</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1367" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1368" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1369" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1370" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="another_digital_video_editor_comma_kino"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e21213"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656607.png.jpg" alt="Another digital video editor, Kino"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-8. Another digital video editor, Kino</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16B-1: Installing Kino and Setting Up Your System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_installing_kino_and_setting_up"/>16B-1: Installing Kino and Setting Up Your System</h2></div></div></div><p>The first and easiest step is to download and install Kino.

You can also view the video in Timeline view (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html#kino_apostrophy_s_timeline_view" title="Figure 16-10. Kino's Timeline view">Figure 16-10</a>) to navigate between the various segments of the video: Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Timeline</strong></span> tab, click the segment you want to view, and then use the playback controls below the playback pane.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1380" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you feel like getting a bit arty, you can also try the effects available in Kino (some examples of which are shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html#examples_of_kino_apostrophy_s_video_effe" title="Figure 16-11. Examples of Kino's video effects, before and after">Figure 16-11</a>) by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>FX</strong></span> tab and then playing around with the various effects in the drop-down menu below the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Video Filter</em></span>. Make your choice, and specify the segment you'd like to convert (or at least experiment with) by typing the beginning and ending frame numbers in the boxes below the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Overwrite</em></span>. To see the results of the filter without saving the changes to disk, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button. If you decide you want to convert the segment to keep the effect, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span> button, and Kino will create a new file of just that segment. You can also double-click those files (as well as the original captures) to view them in Totem, which is better suited to viewing videos than Kino.</p><div class="figure"><a id="kino_apostrophy_s_timeline_view"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e21387"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656611.png.jpg" alt="Kino's Timeline view"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-10. Kino's Timeline view</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="examples_of_kino_apostrophy_s_video_effe"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e21395"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656613.png.jpg" alt="Examples of Kino's video effects, before and after"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-11. Examples of Kino's video effects, before and after</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Other Video Apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="other_video_apps"/>Other Video Apps</h1></div></div></div><p>I've covered the main video applications in Ubuntu, but there are still others that you might want to consider, all of which are available via the Ubuntu Software Center. If you are interested in yet another alternative video/DVD player, you can try GNOME MPlayer, which has long had quite a significant following because of its ability to handle numerous video formats.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1381" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1382" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1383" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1384" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1385" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1386" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1387" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1388" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1389" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1390" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another cool application for video streaming enthusiasts is Miro Internet TV (<a class="xref" href="ch16s07.html#a_video_streaming_enthusiast_apostrophy" title="Figure 16-12. A video streaming enthusiast's dream: Miro">Figure 16-12</a>), which allows you to easily search, download, and play online video streams. Just perform an Ubuntu Software Center search for <span class="emphasis"><em>miro</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1391" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you have a webcam, you might also want to try an application called Cheese, which allows you take pictures and videos from your webcam and add cool graphical effects. Camorama is yet another webcam viewer/capture application to think about.</p><p>If you're looking for an alternative to PiViTi and Kino, try Avidemux. One very handy feature makes it worth having, even if you don't use it as your main video editor: It can rip audio tracks from video files. You can get Avidemux from the Ubuntu Software Center. Be sure to install the GTK+ version (not the Qt one).<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1392" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For those of you interested in ripping DVDs, you might try DVD:Rip, AcidRip DVD Ripper, or the less daunting to figure out Thoggen DVD Ripper. You might also be interested in DVD95 and the more highly configurable K9copy, which are the Linux world's answers to DVDShrink. These applications allow you to rip dual-layer DVDs (DVD9) and compress the output so that it will fit on a single-layer blank DVD disc (DVD5). For creating your own DVDs from scratch (like you would with iDVD), a few applications are worth considering: DVD Styler, QDVDAuthor, and Bombono DVD.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-1393" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1394" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-1395" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_video_streaming_enthusiast_apostrophy"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject16_d1e21486"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656615.png.jpg" alt="A video streaming enthusiast's dream: Miro"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-12. A video streaming enthusiast's dream: Miro</p></div></div></body></html>
