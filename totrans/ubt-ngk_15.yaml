- en: With all the talk in the previous chapter about ripping, encoding, and playing
    back audio files, you may be wondering whether Ubuntu will allow you to transfer
    any of those files to your digital media devices, such as your MP3 player or cell
    phone. Well, you will be happy to know that using your device on your Ubuntu system
    is quite easy—easier than ever before. No longer do you have to mess around with
    mount and unmount commands or edit system tables, and if you don't know what I'm
    talking about, consider yourself lucky. Just plug in your device, and Ubuntu will
    do the rest.

    in [Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. TUX ROCKS"), you shouldn't encounter any
    problems handling music or podcasts on your digital media device in Ubuntu. Even
    if you didn't install them, Ubuntu should automatically help you find the necessary
    items if you try to play a file it doesn't support out of the box. Nevertheless,
    not all formats will work with equal degrees of comfort or success—it depends
    on your device and the file format's compatibility with Ubuntu. As a general rule
    of thumb, most players will be able to handle MP3 files and unlocked AAC (*.m4a*)
    files. Check your device's manual for specifics about other file formats (or just
    give them a try).

    just plug it in via a USB connector, and Ubuntu will mount the device so you can

    "Figure 15-1. Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone.")) and in the left
    pane of any Nautilus window you happen to have open. Two of those what-do-you-want-me-to-do-with-this-stuff
    type of windows that appear when you insert a music CD or DVD into your drive

    "Figure 15-1. Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone."))—will also appear,
    usually one directly above the other. By default, Ubuntu will point you to Rhythmbox
    for music-handling chores and to F-Spot for photo handling, both of which will
    be discussed later in the chapter. Click **OK** in each window to accept Ubuntu's
    choices.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the simple instructions as to how to use your iPod or iPhone with Ubuntu
    out of the way, it's worth thinking about a couple of other things. Most important
    of these is the device's auto-updating settings. When you enable auto-update on
    your iPod or iPhone via iTunes, the function is set up within the device itself.
    You can use your iPod in Windows, Mac OS, or Linux—or all of them interchangeably.
    If you set up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, however, you are leaving
    yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection on
    all of your machines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is simple. Although iTunes allows you to add files to your
    iPod, it does not allow you to copy files from it. The auto-update feature is
    thus strictly a one-way street. This means that whenever you hook up your auto-update–enabled
    iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will automatically add the tracks in
    its library to your iPod; more frighteningly, it will remove any tracks from your
    iPod that are not present in that machine's iTunes library. I learned this the
    hard way when I took my wife's loaded iPod to work and plugged it into my office
    Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library. When I brought the little Podster
    back home to her with nothing at all on it, well . . . what ensued wasn't pretty.

- en: Make sure to disable your iPod's auto-update function before bringing the device
    into the Linux world. To do this, connect your iPod to your Mac or Windows machine,
    and open iTunes. In the left pane of the iTunes window, click your iPod in the
    Devices section, and then in the **Summary** tab in the right pane, check the
    box next to the words *Manually manage music* (or *Manually manage music and videos*
    in video-capable iPods), as shown in [Figure 15-2](ch15s03.html#disabling_the_auto-update_function_on_yo
    "Figure 15-2. Disabling the auto-update function on your iPhone/iPod in iTunes").
    Next, if you have a photo-capable device, repeat nearly the same process for your
    photos by clicking the **Photos** tab in the right pane and then unchecking the
    box next to the words *Sync photos from*.

    if you like), and drag the selected items to your desktop, music folder, or wherever
    you want them. The only catch with this seemingly simple approach is that when
    copying files from an iPod/iPhone, you end up with files on your hard disk with
    funky filenames, such as *ZPAD.m4a* or *ATDT.mp3*, rather than the name that appeared
    on your iPhone/iPod or within Rhythmbox. This means you'll have to rename the
    files once they have been transferred to your hard disk, which isn't much of a
    chore unless you're dealing with lots and lots of files or if you just forget
    which file is which. In case of the latter, right-click the file, click **Properties**,
