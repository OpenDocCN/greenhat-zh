Some people are very organized, placing every file in a logically named folder as soon as that file is saved for the first time. Then there are people like me, who save everything to the desktop until it is so full of junk that they can no longer make out the wallpaper, and only at that point do they start organizing in earnest (if placing all of those files in a single folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>March17Cleanup</em></span> can be called organizing).</p><p>Of course, not only do files get stored on your hard disk, but they are also copied to and from CDs, DVDs, external hard disks, flash drives, and other storage media and devices. They are also often saved in archives, which are then compressed to reduce their spatial footprint, making them easier to send via email or to fit onto removable storage media.</p><p>With that introduction, you may have already guessed that in this chapter I will be dealing with file handling in Ubuntu, particularly in relation to the Nautilus file manager, which is at the heart of GNOME's file-handling capabilities.</p><div class="sect1" title="Nautilus: Your File Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="nautilus_colon_your_file_manager"/>Nautilus: Your File Manager</h1></div></div></div><p>As I mentioned, the program that creates the file viewing and organizing interface on your system is called Nautilus, and it comes as part of the GNOME desktop environment. You may not have thought of an operating system's file manager as a program before, but in fact, that is what it is. (The Windows file manager is called Windows Explorer.) To take a look at Nautilus, just go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Places</strong></span> menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Home Folder</strong></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0517" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0518" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0519" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0520" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0521" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When Nautilus opens to your home folder (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#the_contents_of_your_home_folder_as_view" title="Figure 7-1. The contents of your home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window">Figure 7-1</a>), you will find that you can store your files thematically: <span class="emphasis"><em>Documents</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Public</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Templates</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Videos</em></span>. There is also another folder, titled <span class="emphasis"><em>Desktop</em></span>, which, if double-clicked, will show everything you have stored on your desktop (a lot in my case; most likely nothing in yours). There is also another folder, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples</em></span>, which contains sample files that give you an idea of what Ubuntu has in store for you.</p><p>You can create additional folders and files to your heart's content, so this preconfigured state of affairs is sure to change once you get down to really using your system. In fact, you will be making some changes in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. DRESSING UP THE BIRD">Chapter 8</a>, which will make everything look a bit more lived in.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_contents_of_your_home_folder_as_view"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6966"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656252.png.jpg" alt="The contents of your home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-1. The contents of your home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Side Pane"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_side_pane"/>The Side Pane</h2></div></div></div><p>Nautilus has a lot of interesting features that deserve mention, and the most obvious of these is the side pane, which appears at the left side of the window. The side pane allows you to view a variety of information via selectable views. You can make your choices by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the side pane (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#selecting_views_for_the_nautilus_side_pa" title="Figure 7-2. Selecting views for the Nautilus side pane">Figure 7-2</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0522" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0523" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0524" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0525" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0526" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0527" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0528" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0529" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0530" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0531" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0532" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_views_for_the_nautilus_side_pa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7025"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656254.png.jpg" alt="Selecting views for the Nautilus side pane"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-2. Selecting views for the Nautilus side pane</p></div><p>The default view in Ubuntu is Places, which is a sort of quick navigation tool. In Places you will find icons representing various data-storage locations available to your system, such as your home folder, desktop, full filesystem, any network shares you are connected to (more on that in a moment), and any removable storage media or devices you have in or connected to your system. Clicking any of these icons will show the contents of that location in the right panel of the Nautilus window.</p><p>There are, of course, other views, such as Tree, which provides you with an expandable hierarchical view of your filesystem, and History, which shows you where in your filesystem you have been most recently, much in the way the history function works in a web browser. There are still other views for you to choose from, a couple of which you will work with in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. DRESSING UP THE BIRD">Chapter 8</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Now You See It; Now You Don't"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="now_you_see_it_semicolon_now_you_don_apo"/>Now You See It; Now You Don't</h2></div></div></div><p>The side pane is a rather handy feature, but sometimes you may prefer to have more space to view the contents of your window and thus want to get rid of the pane temporarily. You can do this quite easily by clicking the little gray close button in the upper-right corner of the pane or by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> menu of a Nautilus window and then deselecting <span class="strong"><strong>Side Pane</strong></span>. The check mark next to that entry will then disappear, as will the side pane. To get it back, just return to the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Side Pane</strong></span> again. The check mark will then reappear, as will the side pane itself.</p><p>There is another way to hide the side pane that many people seem to stumble upon accidentally, usually resulting in a bit of unnecessary panic. If you look at the gray border at the right side of the side pane, you will notice that there is a small ribbed section in the center (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#another_way_of_showing_and_hiding_the_na" title="Figure 7-3. Another way of showing and hiding the Nautilus side pane">Figure 7-3</a>). Dragging this ribbed section allows you to resize the width of the pane. What most folks don't realize straight off, however, is that simply clicking that ribbed section acts as a toggle to hide or show the side pane. When the pane is hidden in this way, the ribbed section still appears at the left border of the window, which is not true when the pane is hidden in one of the ways mentioned earlier.</p><p>So there it is—the side pane's little secret. No, it's not a particularly interesting secret, but it's one that should provide you not only with an added layer of convenience but also with some peace of mind.</p><div class="figure"><a id="another_way_of_showing_and_hiding_the_na"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7062"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656256.png.jpg" alt="Another way of showing and hiding the Nautilus side pane"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-3. Another way of showing and hiding the Nautilus side pane</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="File Handling in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="file_handling_in_nautilus"/>File Handling in Nautilus</h1></div></div></div><p>Since Nautilus is primarily a file manager, it only makes sense to get down to the business of using it at that level. Of course, most folks who use computers today are already familiar with the basics of drag-and-drop and a few other means of creating folders and copying, cutting, and moving files. But for those who are unfamiliar with one way or another of performing these essential procedures, I'll spell it all out. If you find this all a bit redundant, please bear with me for the good of the masses.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0533" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0534" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0535" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_comma_naming_comma_and_renaming"/>Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a folder is a simple enough task, and there are two ways of going about it. The easiest (in my opinion) is to right-click any empty space within a Nautilus window, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Create Folder</strong></span> in the pop-up menu that appears. If you prefer using menus over right-clicking empty space, you can instead start things rolling by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Create Folder</strong></span>.</p><p>Regardless of where you made your Create Folder selection, a new folder with the name <span class="emphasis"><em>untitled folder</em></span> will appear in the Nautilus window. The name box of the folder will be highlighted and surrounded with a black box, which means you can immediately give that folder a name by simply typing one—nothing to click or do other than that. Press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, or click any open space in the Nautilus window to complete the job.</p><p>If you later decide that the name you gave your folder needs some tweaking or even a complete revision, you can rename it by right-clicking it and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Rename</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can click the folder once to highlight it and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Rename</strong></span>. After that, you can type the new name for the folder and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, or you can click any open space in the Nautilus window to seal the deal.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Moving Files and Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="moving_files_and_folders"/>Moving Files and Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the easiest of all file manipulations you can perform in Nautilus is moving a file by means of drag-and-drop. I am pretty sure that anybody who has wielded a mouse is familiar with that particular move. There is another way of moving files and folders, however: cut and paste.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0536" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0537" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0538" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0539" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0540" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0541" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0542" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0543" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0544" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The easiest way of doing this is to right-click the file (or folder) you want to move and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Cut</strong></span> from the pop-up menu (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Cut</strong></span> will also do the trick). At this point, it will seem as if nothing has happened, because the file will still be there, but don't worry.</p><p>After that, right-click any open space in the folder to which you want to move the file, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Paste</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. The file will then disappear from its original location and appear in its new one.</p><p>Can you use key combinations to do this? Sure. Simply follow the directions I just gave, but press <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-X to cut and <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-V to paste.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Copying Files and Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copying_files_and_folders"/>Copying Files and Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Based on the instructions I just gave, you can pretty well imagine the methods for copying files and folders, because they are essentially a variation on the same theme. Just right-click the file you want to copy, select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> from the pop-up menu, right-click any open space within the target location, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Paste</strong></span>. Keystroke-wise, that would be <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-C to copy and, as before, <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-V to paste.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0545" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0546" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It is also possible to copy folders and files via the wonders of drag-and-drop, though this involves more hands than required for a simple drag-and-drop move; fortunately, the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold the <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span> key while you drag the file or folder you want to copy to the target location. Be sure to release the mouse button and then the <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span> key (releasing in the opposite order will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its new location.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Navigating in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="navigating_in_nautilus"/>Navigating in Nautilus</h1></div></div></div><p>Navigating through your various folders and subfolders in Nautilus is quite straightforward. In fact, all is conceptually pretty much the same as what you are accustomed to in Windows and Mac OS. You can simply move into and out of folders through a combination of double-clicking folders and clicking the Back, Forward, and Up buttons.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0548" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0549" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0550" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0551" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0547" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Browsing with Breadcrumbs in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="browsing_with_breadcrumbs_in_nautilus"/>Browsing with Breadcrumbs in Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to the hierarchical view option provided in the side pane, another handy feature can make your navigation chores even easier: Nautilus's breadcrumb bar feature. As you wander ever deeper into your forest of folders, Nautilus will leave a trail of breadcrumbs (they look like buttons, actually) in the navigation bar for each folder you opened on the way to the one you are currently viewing.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0552" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Say, for example, that you have a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> inside a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>Dalarna</em></span> inside a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>SwedeStuff</em></span> inside a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>NordicStuff</em></span>, which itself is in your home folder. As you click your way to that <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> folder, starting by double-clicking the <span class="emphasis"><em>NordicStuff</em></span> folder, Nautilus will display a button for that folder . . . and any folder opened before it. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#breadcrumb_navigation_in_nautilus" title="Figure 7-4. Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus">Figure 7-4</a> to see what I mean.</p><div class="figure"><a id="breadcrumb_navigation_in_nautilus"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7290"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656258.png.jpg" alt="Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-4. Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus</p></div><p>As you can see, there is a button for each of the folders within the path from your home folder to your target: <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span>. So what, right? Well, say you want to go back to the <span class="emphasis"><em>NordicStuff</em></span> folder to open a file in which there's some text that you want to copy and then paste into a document within the <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> folder. That sounds like a minor pain, right?</p><p>Well, rather than goof around with the Back button, just follow the breadcrumbs! Simply click the <span class="strong"><strong>NordicStuff</strong></span> breadcrumb button, and the contents of that folder will be there before you. Need to go back to <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span>? Just click the <span class="strong"><strong>gooseberries</strong></span> button. Back to <span class="emphasis"><em>SwedeStuff</em></span>, you say? Just click the <span class="strong"><strong>SwedeStuff</strong></span> button. All quite <span class="emphasis"><em>fantastisk</em></span>!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Spelling It Out—Typing File Paths in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="spelling_it_outmtyping_file_paths_in_nau"/>Spelling It Out—Typing File Paths in Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>If you prefer typing to clicking, you will be happy to know that you can navigate to a folder by typing its path. Just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span> (keyboard shortcut lovers can press <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-L instead). A box will then appear in the location bar (<a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#typing_the_path_to_your_target_folder" title="Figure 7-5. Typing the path to your target folder">Figure 7-5</a>) showing the current location, which, in the case of my berried example, would be <code class="literal">/home/rg/NordicStuff/SwedeStuff/Dalarna/gooseberries</code>. You can type the path to your target folder in that box and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, after which the contents of the target folder will appear below in the main pane of the Nautilus window.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0553" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0554" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0555" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0556" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0557" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0558" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="typing_the_path_to_your_target_folder"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7381"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656260.png.jpg" alt="Typing the path to your target folder"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-5. Typing the path to your target folder</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Bookmarks Within Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bookmarks_within_nautilus"/>Bookmarks Within Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>With all this clicking away to deeply buried subfolders, it is worth mentioning another very handy feature of Nautilus: bookmarks. Yes, Nautilus lets you bookmark folders to which you have navigated. Although you are no doubt familiar with creating bookmarks for web pages that you frequent, you may be wondering why on Earth you would want to create bookmarks within your filesystem.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0559" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0560" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Well, imagine that you have a folder you need to use often, but it is even more buried away than my <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> folder in the previous section. Getting there would take an excessive number of mouse clicks, and all that clicking is bound to eventually give you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Although that is great for your doctor, it is most decidedly not good for you. Instead of maiming yourself, you could click your way to that folder once and then, in the Nautilus window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Add Bookmark</strong></span>. After that, whenever you want to get back to that buried folder, you can just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> menu, and the folder will be right there waiting for you in the drop-down list.</p><p>Another handy thing about Nautilus bookmarks is that they also appear in Save As dialog boxes, such as when you save an OpenOffice.org document or download a file via Firefox. To use them in any such Save As dialog box, just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Save in folder</strong></span> button, and you will find your bookmarks.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Understanding the Linux Filesystem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="understanding_the_linux_filesystem"/>Understanding the Linux Filesystem</h1></div></div></div><p>With all that path typing, navigating, and bookmarking you've just been learning, you should pretty much be able to figure out how to get from here to there in your home folder. Still, it is probably a good idea to know where your home folder actually is in the scheme of things, just in case you manage to get yourself really lost someday. To understand this, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux filesystem that, as you will find, is a bit different from what you were accustomed to in your previous operating system.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0561" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0562" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0563" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0564" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0565" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem all stems from a single point called <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> and is represented by a solitary forward slash (/). Your own user account folder is located within a subfolder of root called <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span>. This is represented as <span class="emphasis"><em>/home</em></span> or, to put it into words, the home folder within root. If your user account were to have the same name as mine, <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>, the path to that folder would be <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg</em></span>, or the <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span> folder within <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span> within root. Whatever the name of your user account or the names of any other accounts you have on your machine happen to be, just remember that when you are lost, your folder, and those for all the other folks with user accounts on your machine, are located within the home folder. If you're a more graphically oriented person, the map in <a class="xref" href="ch07s04.html#the_location_of_your_users_apostrophy_fo" title="Figure 7-6. The location of your users' folders within the Linux filesystem">Figure 7-6</a> should help you.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_location_of_your_users_apostrophy_fo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7478"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656262.png.jpg" alt="The location of your users' folders within the Linux filesystem"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-6. The location of your users' folders within the Linux filesystem</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="What's in All Those Other Folders?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_apostrophy_s_in_all_those_other_fol"/>What's in All Those Other Folders?</h1></div></div></div><p>Needless to say, there is more to the Linux filesystem than the root, home, and user account folders. Several other directories appear at the same level as home, though for the most part, you shouldn't be mucking around with them unless you know what you're doing. Fortunately, most of these folders are write protected, so you should be fairly well protected from yourself. Still, it is natural to be curious about what those other folders are there for, since . . . well, they're there. So, to satisfy your curiosity a bit, I'll do a little explaining.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0566" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0567" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0568" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0569" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0570" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0571" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0572" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0573" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0574" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0575" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0576" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In Ubuntu, four folders contain most of the applications on your system. The essential elements of your system are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/sbin</em></span>. Other elements that need to be there, though they may not be used, such as commands and the like, are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/bin</em></span>. Most of the applications that you actually think of as applications and use in a hands-on way are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr</em></span>. Finally, there are some add-on applications, such as RealPlayer, that install themselves into <span class="emphasis"><em>/opt</em></span>.</p><p>Three other top-level folders that might be of interest to you are <span class="emphasis"><em>/etc</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>/lib</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>/media</em></span>. The first of these, <span class="emphasis"><em>/etc</em></span>, is the location of all the configuration files on your system. The second, <span class="emphasis"><em>/lib</em></span>, is the home of all of the libraries that are required by your system or applications installed on it. These libraries are the Linux equivalent of a Windows <span class="emphasis"><em>.dll</em></span> file. Finally, <span class="emphasis"><em>/media</em></span> is where the contents of your various attached external media (such as USB drives and CDs) appear when present.</p><p>There are other top-level folders, but their purposes are a bit less straightforward for the average Linux newbie and, to be honest, probably not all that interesting to you at this stage. Anyway, as I mentioned, there is no reason for you to be mucking around with any of these folders for the time being, because you can access the items located within them in different, and much safer, ways.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Using Nautilus as a Network Browser"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="using_nautilus_as_a_network_browser"/>Using Nautilus as a Network Browser</h1></div></div></div><p>Another handy Nautilus feature is its ability to function as a network browser. You can, for example, see what networks and shares are available to you on your home or office network by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span> in the side pane of the Nautilus window or by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Places</strong></span> menu in the GNOME panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span>. You can do the same from within a Nautilus window by going to its <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span>. Icons for any networks or computers on that network would then appear in the Nautilus window, like in <a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html#viewing_the_computers_on_your_network" title="Figure 7-7. Viewing the computers on your network">Figure 7-7</a>. From that window, you can then double-click your way to a share that you have permission to access, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder of a Windows machine or the public folders of a Mac. By the way, in case you are wondering what a share is, I'll clear that up for you: A <span class="emphasis"><em>network share</em></span> is a location on a computer, such as a folder, where other users on a network can access and save files. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder on a Windows system is a good example. Other users on a network can copy files from and (usually) write files to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder, whereas they cannot access any other part of the filesystem on that host machine.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0577" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0578" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0579" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If the share you are trying to open requires a username and password, you will be asked for those in a new window. Note that, in this case, the username and password you need to enter are those for the machine to which you are trying to connect—not the ones you're using in Ubuntu (unless the usernames and/or passwords happen to be the same, of course). You can then copy files to and from that share as if it were a folder on your own hard disk.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_the_computers_on_your_network"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7633"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656264.png.jpg" alt="Viewing the computers on your network"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-7. Viewing the computers on your network</p></div><p>In some cases, especially when trying to access shares on a Mac running OS X, the double-click method will not work. You will not be able to access any share on a particular machine, even if an icon for that machine appears in the Nautilus window. In such cases, double-click the icon for the machine you are trying to access and then, once open (to an empty window), select <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span>. A text box will appear in the location bar (just like in <a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html#typing_the_path_to_your_target_folder" title="Figure 7-5. Typing the path to your target folder">Figure 7-5</a>) with the location of the machine you are trying to access already listed.</p><p>To that location, add a forward slash (/) followed by the username used on the target machine. For example, if the target machine is called <span class="emphasis"><em>cowboycats</em></span> and the username is <span class="emphasis"><em>mewtoyou</em></span>, the location would be <code class="literal">smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou</code>. You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the machine, as long as you know the path to that folder, by adding to the path you've already typed; <code class="literal">smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou/Documents</code>, for example. If you prefer, you can type <span class="strong"><strong>smb:</strong></span>// and your Mac's IP address, which consists of a set of four numbers separated by periods. In the case of one of my machines, I would type <code class="literal">smb://192.168.0.100</code>. (You can find a Mac's IP address by going to the Mac's System Preferences, clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Sharing</strong></span>, and then clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Sharing</strong></span>. The address should appear immediately below the service selection pane.)</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In case you are wondering, the <code class="literal">smb</code> at the head of that path stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>server message block</em></span>, but to make things easier (and perhaps more useful in terms of your memory), you can just think of it as being short for <span class="emphasis"><em>Samba</em></span>, which is software used by Unix-based systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X) in order to interact with Windows networks.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0580" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Once you've made your way to the folder you want to browse on the networked machine you've connected to, it might be a good idea to use the bookmark function in Nautilus to bookmark that open share window.

These readability and alterability states are referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>permissions</em></span>.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering what the point of this permissions business is, so in order to help you understand, I will give you some examples of how it can be useful. Let's say you have some files that you don't want your spouse or kids to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas shopping list, for example. By denying read permission to those files or to a folder containing those files, no one would be able to sneak a peek unless they were savvy at changing permissions and had the permissions necessary to change permissions for those files or folders.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0589" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As another example, imagine you have a file that you have worked many hours on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might accidentally ruin that file in some way, you could deny yourself write permissions. By doing this, you wouldn't be able to save any changes you make to that file. You would be given the Save As option, but if you wanted to change the file itself, you would have to change the permissions. When you place such restrictions on a file or folder, a lock emblem appears on the icon for it, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html#nautilus_tells_you_when_permissions_rest" title="Figure 7-8. Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement.">Figure 7-8</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="nautilus_tells_you_when_permissions_rest"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7764"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656266.png.jpg" alt="Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-8. Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="changing_file_and_folder_permissions_in"/>Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus</h3></div></div></div><p>To change file or folder permissions in Nautilus, just right-click the file or folder in question, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.

Permissions can be granted or denied to the <span class="emphasis"><em>owner</em></span> of the file or folder (you), to a specified <span class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span>, or to <span class="emphasis"><em>others</em></span> (everybody else). Traditionally, these permissions are referred to as follows:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Read</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Permission to view the contents of a file or folder</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Write</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Permission to alter the contents of a file or folder</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Execute</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Permission to run a program or script</p></dd></dl></div><p>Nautilus has tried to spell things out a bit more, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html#changing_permissions_in_a_nautilus_prope" title="Figure 7-9. Changing permissions in a Nautilus Properties window for files and folders">Figure 7-9</a>. In general, however, you needn't worry all that much about setting permissions for your own files, because you are really the only one who has access to your user account. One possible exception you might run into is when you transfer files from CD to your hard disk. In this case, the files will be write protected, meaning you cannot alter the files until you change the permissions for them. You can change the permissions of such files in order to allow yourself to alter them by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Owner</strong></span> section of the Properties window and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Read and write</strong></span> in the menu next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Access</em></span> (for files) or <span class="strong"><strong>Create and delete files</strong></span> in the menu next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>File access</em></span> (for folders).

Instead, what you see in the CD/DVD Creator window are essentially links pointing to the original files in their original locations. Thus, if you move one of the files from its original location before burning the contents of the CD/DVD Creator window to disc, the link won't work any more and the file won't be copied onto the disc.

If that explanation seems a bit obtuse, you can basically think of them working like floppy disks (albeit with considerably more storage capacity).<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0629" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0630" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Nautilus has basic support for multisession discs, but let's try something a little more specialized this time: Brasero, which is a more fully featured application that you can use for all of your disc-burning chores.</p><p>You can run Brasero from the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> menu by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Sound &amp; Video</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Brasero Disc Burner</strong></span>.

<div class="sect1" title="USB Storage Devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="usb_storage_devices"/>USB Storage Devices</h1></div></div></div><p>Unless you have been under a digital rock for the past few years, you are no doubt well familiar with USB devices. Your printer is very likely a USB device, as is your scanner. And although your digital camera is not a USB device in the traditional sense, chances are that every time you connect it to your computer in order to transfer photos, you are doing so via a USB connector.</p><p>Among the most popular USB devices out there are those used for file storage. These include external hard disks, flash memory card readers, and the tiny, finger-sized devices known as <span class="emphasis"><em>flash drives</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch07s09.html#usb_storage_devices-id1" title="Figure 7-16. USB storage devices">Figure 7-16</a>). Flash drives are especially popular today and deservedly so: They are inexpensive, handy when you need to transfer large amounts of data, and pretty safe in terms of cross-platform (including Linux) compatibility.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0638" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Working with USB storage devices is really easy. Just plug the device into one of the USB ports on your computer. The LED on the device will do a bit of blinking while the system reads what's on it, and after that, a disc icon for that device will appear on your desktop. A few moments later, a Nautilus window will open, revealing the contents of the device. An icon for the USB device will also appear in the side pane of the Nautilus window. You can then copy files to and from the device using the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste procedures I mentioned earlier in this chapter.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0639" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Once you are done and want to remove the device, right-click its desktop icon, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Safely Remove Drive</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. (You can also right-click the icon in the Nautilus side pane and select the same option.) If there is any data that needs to be written to the device, the system will start writing. Once it's complete, the icon for the device will disappear from the desktop and Nautilus folder. Make sure that you always safely remove USB drives like this, rather than simply disconnecting them—otherwise, you risk losing data.</p><div class="figure"><a id="usb_storage_devices-id1"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e8455"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656282.png.jpg" alt="USB storage devices"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-16. USB storage devices</p></div></div>

Hours of typing, hundreds of photos, piles of music CDs—it's all there on the hard disk. So, what happens to it if something goes wrong with your computer? In many cases the answer is, unfortunately, that all of the data is lost forever. To save you the pain of this experience, it's a great idea to make regular backups.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0644" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0645" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0646" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0647" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0648" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0649" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Plenty of backup utilities are available, but <span class="emphasis"><em>Déjà Dup</em></span> stands out to me as being the easiest to use. Open the Ubuntu Software Center, and install the <span class="emphasis"><em>Déjà Dup Backup Utility</em></span>. It'll put itself in the <span class="strong"><strong>System Tools</strong></span> section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> menu, so head over there and start it up.</p><p>Now is a good time to decide what you're going to use to store your backups. I have an external USB hard disk that does the trick, but you can use a USB flash drive, recordable CD or DVD, or even a web server. I wouldn't recommend putting your backups on the same computer, though. The best policy is to put some distance between the original files and the backups, so if there's a fire or some other disaster, you'll have at least one copy of them left intact. Make sure you have enough space for the backup too; regular CDs are only 700MB, but my <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder alone weighs in at a whopping 4.3GB!</p><p>Connect, insert, or otherwise prepare your chosen backup device, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Backup</strong></span> button in Déjà Dup. A Preferences window will pop up like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch07s11.html#choosing_where_to_save_the_backup_files" title="Figure 7-21. Choosing where to save the backup files in Déjà Dup">Figure 7-21</a>.

Say, for example, that you wanted to back up everything in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Home</em></span> folder except for your pictures—maybe you don't have space on your backup disk for all of them. All you'd need to do is to make sure that your <span class="emphasis"><em>Home Folder</em></span> is in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Include files in folders</em></span> list and your <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder is in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Except files in folders</em></span> list.</p><p>When you've chosen what to keep and what to ignore, click <span class="strong"><strong>Forward</strong></span> again to get to the summary page.

But remember, there's little point in backing up if you don't do it regularly, since you'll only be able to recover your older files (and not more recent ones) if something does go wrong. I make a backup about once a month, but I should probably do it more regularly than that. It's not much of a chore; when you next use Déjà Dup, it'll remember all of your settings from the previous backup. If you want to do something different, click <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> in the main window, and change the options there.

In the Windows world, these are generally referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>Zip files</em></span>, while in the Linux world, <span class="emphasis"><em>tarball</em></span> is the operative name. The Linux name, in case you're wondering, comes from the application that is used to create the archive for such files, Tar. Compressed archives are great for two reasons: They let you bundle a load of files together into one handy package, and they also squeeze all the files down so that they take up less space on your hard disk. If you've ever tried to email a bunch of files to someone, you know how useful this can be.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0661" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0662" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0663" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0664" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0665" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Anyway, to get some of the hands-on stuff down, you'll be creating a Windows/Linux/Mac–friendly Zip file and then extracting it. You can get down to business by opening a Nautilus window and creating a couple of dummy files to work with. Do this by going to the Nautilus <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Create Document</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Empty File</strong></span>. A new file will appear in the Nautilus window, with its name highlighted. You can type a name for the file, such as the one I'm using: <span class="emphasis"><em>dogwood</em></span>. Now repeat the process to create a second file. I'll be calling that one <span class="emphasis"><em>violet</em></span>. Use something equally evocative for yours.</p><p>Now that you have two files to work with, you can create the compressed archive by following these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select the two files either by clicking your mouse to the side of the files and then dragging the cursor (with the mouse button still pressed) over both files until they are highlighted or by holding down the <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span> key and clicking each file individually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once both files are highlighted, right-click either one, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Compress</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Compress window that then appears, type <span class="strong"><strong>blossoms</strong></span> in the Filename text box, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>.zip</strong></span> from the drop-down menu button to the right of that.
