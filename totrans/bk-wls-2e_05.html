As soon as you connect the adapter to your computer, or as soon as you turn on an internal adapter or your computer, the computer automatically detects the device and runs the control software to set up a connection.</p><p>This chapter will explain how to set up a Wi-Fi connection for two kinds of users: the home or office user who wants to connect to a fixed access point once and assume that is keeps working every time; and a laptop user who wants to connect to different networks in different locations.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="installing_pc_card_adapters"/>Installing PC Card Adapters</h1></div></div></div><p>Network adapters on PC Cards plug into the PCMCIA socket on a portable computer or the socket adapter that fits an expansion slot in a desktop computer (yes, that does mean that one kind of adapter sometimes plugs into another kind of adapter). To install the PC Card, just insert it gently but firmly into the socket. When it's properly seated, you should feel the holes on the edge of the card grab the pins inside the socket.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0438"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0439"/></p><p>Most wireless PC Card adapters contain internal antennas that extend an inch or more beyond the outer edge of the PCMCIA socket. However, a few adapters come with connectors <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0440"/>for external antennas. If you are using an external antenna, place the antenna in the location where you want to operate it, and run the antenna cable from the antenna to the network adapter's antenna connector. <span class="emphasis"><em>Be gentle</em></span>. Often the tiny connectors used by laptop adapters are fragile, and damaging the connectors or cables can lead to loss of signal.</p></div></div>

If you ordered your computer without an internal Wi-Fi card and decide to install one later, or if you want to replace the existing card with a new and better model (such as a card that includes the new 802.11n specification when such cards become available), you must open up the computer to reach the adapter.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0444"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0445"/></p><p>Don't try to take apart a laptop computer without specific instructions for your particular make and model. Laptops are all designed to squeeze as many parts and features as possible into a very small package, and there's usually just one correct way to get to each component. Unless you find and remove exactly the right set of screws and covers in exactly the right order, you probably won't get to the part or socket you want, but you <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> create a whole new set of problems.</p><p>Fortunately, most laptop makers offer detailed step-by-step instructions for removing and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0446"/>installing an internal Wi-Fi card in service manuals and online tech support websites. Before you try to open up the computer, it's absolutely necessary to read the full procedure in the manual or online. If there's an online video that shows the procedure, watch the whole thing, and then step through it again (if you have a second computer to watch it on) as you install your new card.</p></div>

But it's no different from adding any other expansion card, which most network managers and serious home computer users have probably done more times than they care to think about.</p><p>You know the routine: Unplug the power cable. Open the case. Find a vacant expansion slot. Remove the metal backplane cover. Insert the adapter into the slot. Screw it down. Close the case. Plug the power cable back into the computer. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.</p><p>Many internal network adapters are actually PC Card adapters with PCMCIA sockets that fit into an expansion slot. Unless the adapter manual tells you otherwise, it's a good idea to remove the PC Card from the socket <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0448"/>before you install the socket in your computer. It often takes a bit of twisting and pushing to seat the socket properly in the expansion slot, and the socket is more flexible without the card in place. After you reassemble the computer, insert the adapter into the socket and load the wireless adapter driver.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="loading_the_driver_software"/>Loading the Driver Software</h1></div></div></div><p>Regardless of their physical format, just about all wireless adapters are plug-and-play devices, which means that Windows should automatically recognize the adapter and load the relevant drivers as soon as you install it. However, sometimes you'll need to install a specific software driver manually before your operating system can use the adapter to send and receive data.</p><p>Drivers can come from three sources: some are supplied with the operating system or a copy might have been provided on a diskette or a CD with the adapter. But the best source for the most recent version of any driver is the manufacturer's online technical support website. You can also find links to the latest Windows drivers for your adapter from one of these driver directories on the Internet:</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td>

One of these programs was included with Windows and another comes with the network adapter. Yet another program might be part of the bundled software supplied by the maker of your laptop computer. All of these programs perform the same tasks, and they all display similar information, but each one arranges the commands and displays differently.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0452"/></p><p>It's worth the time and trouble to try all of the Wi-Fi programs installed on your computer because you will probably find one that is easier to use than any of the others. It's also possible that one program is more sensitive to marginal signals.</p><p>The way you use your Wi-Fi control program depends on how you use wireless connections. If you keep the computer in one place most of the time with a Wi-Fi link to the Internet and your home or office network, you should configure the Wi-Fi control program to automatically find and use your own network every time you turn on the computer. On the other hand, if you're mainly using the computer as a portable unit that you move from place to place, the control program should detect and display all the nearby Wi-Fi signals and allow you to choose the one you want to use.

Drivers for less common operating systems may be available from the adapter manufacturer's technical support websites or from user groups devoted to the operating system in question.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0543"/>For Macintosh users, your best bet is to use Apple <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0544"/>AirPort adapters and the software provided with them, which are fully compatible with other Wi-Fi networks. But some other adapters will also work with a Mac, if you have the right drivers. <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. WI-FI FOR MAC">Chapter 8</a> explains how to use AirPort software with a Macintosh.</p><p>If you have some other make of PC Card or USB wireless adapter, don't give up hope.

Some recent releases of several flavors of Unix and Linux include drivers for several widely-used Wi-Fi chip sets. <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. WI-FI FOR LINUX AND UNIX">Chapter 7</a> contains more detailed information about using Linux and Unix on a Wi-Fi network.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="signal_strength_vs_signal_quality"/>Signal Strength vs. Signal Quality</h1></div></div></div><p>Most wireless utilities show signal strength and quality in bar graphs, or as a percentage value, but they don't tell you what a signal at 100 percent strength is 100 percent <span class="emphasis"><em>of</em></span>. It's important to understand that signal strength and signal quality are not the same thing; a wireless adapter does not have to receive a signal at full strength to move data at the maximum possible speed. As long as the receiver can capture a clean signal, the network's performance should be acceptable. But even a strong signal can suffer if the receiver also picks up interference from other wireless networks or from other devices that use the same radio frequencies, such as wireless telephones and microwave ovens.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0545"/></p><p>And even if the data transfer speed is slower than the maximum possible rate, it might not make any real difference. For example, if you're using a Wi-Fi network to connect your computer to the Internet through a DSL line (at about 1.5Mbps or less), it won't matter if your local wireless network speed drops from 11Mbps down to 2Mbps; that's still a lot more bandwidth than you need because the slower DSL line is the slowest part of the overall connection. On the other hand, when you use the same networks for computer-to-computer file transfers, a faster wireless link will make a noticeable difference.</p><p>The spread spectrum radio signal used in a Wi-Fi network is not the same as an FM radio signal, but the interference and signal quality problems are similar. If you live in or near a big city, you can probably receive a dozen or more FM radio stations on your kitchen radio. Some of these stations might have transmitters close to your house, and others transmit from the other side of town or even farther away. But as long as your radio can capture a station at a minimum useful level, the radio reproduces the music reasonably well; the signal from the little teakettle college radio station a mile away sounds just as good as the big commercial station with a much more powerful transmitter up in the hills (this is a technical discussion—programming is a whole other question). On the other hand, if you're out on the fringes of the station's coverage area, or if there's another nearby station using the same frequency, the sound of the station you want to hear might be noisy and hard to understand. In the same way, the overall quality of a wireless network link is affected by both signal <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0546"/>strength and the presence or absence of unwanted <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0547"/>noise.</p><p>The technical definition of <span class="emphasis"><em>noise</em></span> in an information channel is <span class="emphasis"><em>any unwanted energy or information</em></span>. The only thing you want your network adapter to receive is the digital signal that came from the access point you want to use; so everything else that shows up at the receiver is noise. This can include <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0548"/>interference from other wireless data networks and other radios using the same frequencies (such as cordless telephones, microwave ovens, and medical electronics) and interference from natural sources such as lightning. Up to a point, the digital technology and spread spectrum radio system used in an 802.11b network can do a pretty good job of ignoring interference, but when the noise is just as strong as the signal you want, the network will apply its error correction features until it can confirm that an intelligible signal has made it from the transmitter to the receiver.</p><p>A stream of noise or another pair of radios trying to use the same channel at the same time can reduce a link's data transfer speed, but so can a weak signal. As the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases, the amount of energy that the receiver detects will decrease until the signal is simply too weak for the receiver to decode the data. And if there are physical obstructions that absorb some of the radiated energy between the transmitter and the receiver, the useful signal range will be even shorter. That's why Wi-Fi reception is better outdoors than indoors.</p><p>It's possible to use a high-gain antenna to increase the signal strength, and you can raise the antenna to the top of a tower or a tall building to increase the useful distance that it will travel, but at some point the signal strength will be too weak to be useful. That's why most wireless network utility programs show separate readings for signal strength and signal quality. When a problem does occur, you can use the two measurements to help identify the source of the problem: If the signal is strong but the quality is low, the problem is probably caused by some kind of interference, but if both signal quality <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-5-0549"/>and signal strength are low, it's likely that you're too far away from the nearest access point or there's some kind of obstruction between you and the access point.</p><p>Any time the network fails to transmit a data packet successfully, the device at the receiving end instructs the transmitting device to send the same packet again. This can happen when there is noise or interference on the link (radio or wired), when other users are trying to use the same channel at the same time, or when a radio signal is too weak for the receiver to decode the data contained in the packet. One or two repeated packets in a data stream won't make any real difference, but when it becomes necessary to send almost every packet several times before the receiver accepts it, the actual data transfer speed will be half or less of the nominal speed. A pair of Wi-Fi radios might try to compensate for a poor signal by dropping the transmission speed (this is the same kind of approach as speaking slowly and distinctly over a noisy telephone line), but the effect is often the same: It takes longer to receive the data.</p><p>Slow data transfer is not always caused by the radio portion of the network; it can also happen when there's heavy traffic on a server or some kind of noise on the wired portion of the network.</p><p>So several problems can all produce the same symptoms. When the data speed appears to slow down, the cause could be in:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The radio link or signal quality</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The server</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Someplace else in the network—your local network's access point might be connected to a noisy land line</p></li></ul></div><p>To isolate the source of the problem, run your Wi-Fi status program or a signal monitor program like NetStumbler on the client computer. If the signal strength is low, try moving to a different location away from obstructions between your computer and the access point. If the signal strength is adequate but signal quality is poor, the network adapter is probably receiving noise along with the network data; look for a signal from an access point that uses a different channel number. If you can, move your network to other channel numbers as far away as possible from the other networks near you to find a segment of the spectrum that has fewer competing signals. And if both signal strength and signal quality are adequate but the data transfer speed is slow, the cause is probably in the server or someplace else in the network.</p></div></body></html>
