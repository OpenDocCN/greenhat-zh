- en: Hackers are people and, like most people, hackers paradoxically embrace their
    individuality while immersing themselves in their collective identity as rebels,
    free thinkers, mischief makers, and technology wizards. Despite appearances to
    the contrary, people do not become hackers because of how they look, what they
    wear, or how they speak. People become hackers by virtue of how they think and
    what they do.

    and there are "bad" hackers (called *black hat hackers*). In between are the so-called
    *gray hat hackers*, who cross the border between good and bad depending on what's
    convenient for them at the time (like most people in the world).

    services such as Tripod ([www.tripod.lycos.com](http://www.tripod.lycos.com)),
    Geocities ([http://geocities.yahoo.com](http://geocities.yahoo.com)), and AngelFire
    ([http://angelfire.lycos.com](http://angelfire.lycos.com)). Such websites are
    often short-lived, as hackers grow tired of updating them. Besides, few people

    to create a website with a descriptive domain address. Like their free web hosting
    counterparts, these hacker websites rarely last long because anything considered
    too controversial (such as live computer viruses and software patches designed
    to circumvent Microsoft Windows' product activation feature) can quickly get the
    website operator in trouble with the authorities, who will shut it down. It's
    said that when hackers started distributing a program that disabled Windows XP
    from running its product activation feature, for example, Microsoft quickly shut
    down any websites that offered it.

    install remote-access Trojan horses (see [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Trojan

    linking bot-infected computers together, a hacker can create an army of "zombies"
    or "drones." With a single command, they can be instructed to send a flood of
    data to another computer that will shut it down (a denial of service attack),
    or send out massive amounts of junk email (spam). (Individual computers connected

    on MAC address filtering so that your WiFi network only allows computers with
    network interfaces with specific MAC addresses to access the network. Finally,
    turn on WEP encryption. While WEP encryption can't protect your network from a
    determined hacker, it can discourage the opportunistic hacker looking for an easy
    WiFi network to access. New WiFi equipment supports an improved encryption standard
    known as WiFi Protected Access (WPA). Given a choice, use WPA instead of WEP encryption.

    *rootkits*, which are programs, or groups of programs, designed to punch holes
    through a computer's defenses. That way, if a system administrator finds and blocks
    the first route the hacker used to access the computer, the rootkit will have
    created several alternate ways for the hacker to get back inside. Some rootkits,

    advantage of vulnerabilities in the operating system or server software), and
    Trojan horses (for opening backdoors into the computer and masking the intruder's
    activities). Once a hacker has installed a rootkit on a computer, he can sneak

    at a time, but modern systems such as Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X can run multiple

    get loaded into memory and which programs can use the CPU, while it simultaneously
    checks for input from the keyboard or mouse and sends output to the computer screen.

    system may also load additional programs called device drivers, which are simple
    programs that tell the operating system how to work with external equipment, such
    as a printer or scanner. When a program such as a word processor needs to print
    data, it sends this information to the operating system, which uses the device
    driver to send it to the printer.

    a computer, it's nearly impossible to clean it off the system without reformatting
    the hard disk and reinstalling the operating system. The biggest danger from rootkits
    is their use as a combined Trojan horse/worm/spyware infection tool. Ordinarily,
    when malware infects a computer, it's fairly easy to find and remove. But by combining
    rootkit technology with Trojan horses and worms, malware creators can develop
    programs that not only infect a computer, but also hide from any detection programs.

    copy-protection method borrows from rootkit techniques by installing itself on
    a computer and then hiding in memory, even when the copy-protected CD is no longer
    in the computer. Removing this software can be difficult and, even if successful,
    it can disable the computer's CD player, making it impossible to play legally
    purchased CDs. Needless to say, Sony took a lot of heated criticism for this.

    DNS server should return the valid Yahoo! IP address as 68.142.226.32\. But if
    the DNS server has been poisoned, it will return whatever IP address the censor
    has associated with the [www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com) domain name. This
    might be a message explaining that the requested website is blocked or a bogus
    website designed to look like the real thing.

    protocol (FTP) uses port 21, and email is sent using port 25\. So to block file
    transfers and email, governments can just block ports 21 and 25\. Users can then
    do anything they want—except transfer files or send and receive email, which is

    Instead of sending FTP file transfers through port 21 or web page requests through
    port 80, the computer sends all this information through port 25, the only port
    allowed through the firewall. This information gets sent to a proxy server on
    the other side of the firewall, which then accesses the normal ports needed to
    transfer files via FTP (port 21) or access web pages (port 80). As far as the
    censoring firewall can tell, the computer is using only port 25.

    update their lists of banned sites to remain effective, which presents a problem

    Gnutella2, or just G2 ([www.gnutella2.com](http://www.gnutella2.com)).

    designed to accelerate file searches. Despite the improvements, most Gnutella2
    clients still connect to the older Gnutella network as well, allowing users to
    search for files on both networks simultaneously.

- en: Dozens of client programs tap into the Gnutella network every day. Unfortunately,
    Gnutella's popularity has also limited its growth. With no one effectively controlling
    it, the network cannot change or improve unless all Gnutella clients change and
    improve at the same time, which is nearly impossible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, even though Gnutella's greatest strength is its decentralized network,
    that also causes file searching to take a long time, since each file request has
    to go through every computer connected to the network. Given these limitations,
    many former Gnutella clients have broken away and started their own filesharing
    networks. One of the first examples of these is called Ares ([http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net](http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net)).

    only be officially accessed using the Kazaa ([www.kazaa.com](http://www.kazaa.com))
    client developed by the same company. Unlike Gnutella, FastTrack is a closed,
    proprietary network that only licensed clients are allowed to access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like Gnutella, FastTrack is a decentralized network, but it offers three major
    advantages. First, FastTrack can download files from multiple sources to speed
    up file transfers and ensure that you get the file you want, even if one or more
    computers disconnect from the network. Second, FastTrack can resume downloading
    an interrupted file transfer so you don't have to start all over again. Third,
    FastTrack can search for files quickly by dividing its network into sections,
    called *nodes*, where each node is linked to a computer designated as a Supernode.

    searches only each Supernode; each Supernode searches its linked nodes for the
    requested file. This accelerates file searching so that, regardless of how many
    computers are connected to the network, file searching won't slow down, as can
    happen on the Gnutella network.

    "Figure 12-5. To install many free filesharing clients, you must first agree to
    load your computer with adware/spyware.") shows a typical agreement specifying
    all the different adware/spyware that may get installed on your computer when
    you install the Grokster filesharing client program, which once connected to the
    FastTrack network just like Kazaa.

- en: If you don't want adware/spyare installed on your computer but you still want
    to access the FastTrack network, you can either pay for the non–adware/spyware
    version of Kazaa, or you can use an unofficial FastTrack client called KLT K++
    ([www.klitetools.com](http://www.klitetools.com)). The owner of FastTrack, Sharman
    Networks, frowns upon any unofficial FastTrack clients, however, so they're constantly
    changing the network to keep rogue client programs like KLT K++ from working.
    But then the programmers of KLT K++ rewrite their client program and reconnect
    to FastTrack once more, until the next time Sharman Networks changes FastTrack
    again.

    the benefits of the official client program.

    Gnutella design of a decentralized network. The minor differences among the different

    MP3 files ranging in size from 3MB to 10MB), but they weren't so great for sharing
    massive files of the contents of an entire CD or DVD, such popular programs as
    Adobe Photoshop, or an illegal video file copy of *Star Wars*. It simply took
    too long, as much as several hours, to share the contents of a CD (typically 650MB
    in size) or a DVD (typically 4.7GB in size).

    dedicated to large files. The two most popular are eDonkey and BitTorrent.

    finished downloading them from another computer. With both eDonkey ([www.edonkey.com](http://www.edonkey.com))
    and BitTorrent ([www.bittorrent.com](http://www.bittorrent.com)), you can start
    sharing files even while you're receiving them, which means you can download and
    share a file simultaneously, making large file transfers faster and more reliable.

- en: From a technical point of view, there's nothing wrong with filesharing. The
    creators and owners of many types of files want to distribute them freely as widely
    as possible. Many musicians release MP3 files of their songs, hoping to attract
    an audience. Aspiring radio broadcasters can store interviews as MP3 files and
    distribute them as sound files, known as *podcasts*, that anyone can download
    and listen to whenever they want. To find different podcasts, visit the Podcast
    Directory ([www.podcast.net](http://www.podcast.net)).

    networks. Many Linux distributions actually depend on people using filesharing
    networks to spread them around the world.
  prefs: []

    distribute their own copyrighted material. The problem is that legal applications
    of filesharing are dwarfed by the widespread illegal ones.

    can often find the latest Hollywood movies being swapped on these networks, sometimes
    even before they're officially released in theaters. BitTorrent and eDonkey are
    also favorite networks for swapping entire music albums and CDs or popular programs
    such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Illustrator.

    filesharing networks, such as Gnutella or FastTrack. There, they can copy the
    best songs off an album, store them as MP3 files, and then pass the files around.
    Their convenience and ease of use make the filesharing networks havens for rampant
    software, music, and video copyright violations, as shown in [Figure 12-6](ch12s04.html#on_a_typical_filesharing_network_comma_y

    such blatant copyright infringement, but, with so many different filesharing networks
    available and nearly all controlled by nobody in particular, trying to shut down
    a filesharing network is nearly impossible. Tracking down individual violators
    is often too costly and time-consuming, except in extreme cases where individuals
    are sharing hundreds or thousands of movies or songs, or distributing the latest
    blockbuster movie or eagerly awaited pop album before it's officially released.

    it's having more success taking legal action against the companies that make the
    filesharing programs in the first place. In 2005, US courts shut down Grokster,
    one of the few licensed clients allowed to access the FastTrack network. That
    same year they also shut down WinMX, a filesharing program that originally tapped
    into the OpenNap network, but later evolved to form an independent filesharing
    network. The RIAA will likely continue to pursue legal action against any company
    that makes money selling filesharing programs. (This still leaves the free filesharing
    programs untouched.)
