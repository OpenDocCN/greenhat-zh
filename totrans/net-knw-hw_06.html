If you plan to connect your LAN to the Internet, the control center must also include a gateway router and a modem. This chapter explains how to assemble a control center and run cables between the control center and the computers, game consoles, printers, and other devices that make up your network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0557"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0558"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="connectors_comma_wall_plates_comma_and"/>Connectors, Wall Plates, and Surface Boxes</h1></div></div></div><p>As part of your floor plan, you chose a location in each room for a network outlet. In places where you decide to use surface boxes, you can attach the outlet block to the baseboard with double-sided adhesive or wood screws. For wall plates, you must cut a hole in the wall and use a mounting bracket like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#use_a_mounting_bracket_to_attach_data_o" title="Figure 6-1. Use a mounting bracket to attach data outlet wall plates to a wall.">Figure 6-1</a> to attach the plate to the wall. If there's an electrical outlet on the same wall, measure the distance from the bottom of the plate to the floor and mount the data plate at exactly the same height. Remember to keep data outlets at least a foot away from the nearest electrical outlet. When you tighten the screws on the front of the mounting bracket, the wings inside the wall will turn and hold the bracket in place.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0559"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0560"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0561"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0562"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0563"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0564"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0565"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0566"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0567"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0568"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0569"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0570"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0571"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0572"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0573"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0574"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0575"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="use_a_mounting_bracket_to_attach_data_o"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4591"/><img alt="Use a mounting bracket to attach data outlet wall plates to a wall." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266254.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 6-1. Use a mounting bracket to attach data outlet wall plates to a wall.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>If you want to install a single combined wall outlet plate for data, telephone wiring, and video, use a modular plate with snap-in connectors.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ethernet_cable"/>Ethernet Cable</h1></div></div></div><p>All Ethernet cables have four color-coded pairs of wires twisted together: green with green and white, brown with brown and white, and so forth. Ethernet cables and connectors are identified as Category 5 (CAT5), enhanced Category 5 (CAT5e), or Category 6 (CAT6), depending on the amount of data that can pass through a cable and the cable's sensitivity to interference. Unless you plan to install a super-fast Gigabit Ethernet network, CAT5e is usually the best compromise between cost and performance in a home or small office network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0579"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0580"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0581"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0582"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0583"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0584"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0585"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0586"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0578"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0587"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0588"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Don't use CAT5 cable for new installations. It might be okay for today's networks, but it won't reliably support the next generation of high-speed data services.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0589"/></p></div><p>Ethernet cables come in two forms: bulk cable on spools or in boxes, and pre-assembled cables with connectors already attached. Pre-assembled data cables are often called <span class="emphasis"><em>patch cords</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>patch cables</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>jumper cables</em></span>. They're available in many colors and in lengths ranging from 1 foot to 100 feet. Use different-colored patch cords with a switch or any other device that has lots of connections; multiple colors will allow you to find the right one quickly.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0590"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0591"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0592"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0593"/></p><p>Bulk cable is the right choice for runs inside walls between your control center and the data outlets in other rooms. On the other hand, pre-built cables are better for shorter distances, such as between terminal blocks or wall outlets and computers, control devices, and other equipment, because they're often made with more durable jackets and plugs that have permanent collars. It's possible to build your own patch cords out of bulk cable and loose plugs, but attaching plugs to cables is tedious work that's generally more trouble than it's worth. As a rule of thumb, use bulk cable for permanent installations with a terminal block to each end, and pre-built cables for patch cords and for connections between wall outlets and network devices.</p><p>Patch cords are widely available in office supply and electronics stores, but they're often four or five times more expensive than the identical cables sold through industrial electronics suppliers and online sources such as Jameco (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jameco.com/">http://www.jameco.com/</a>), Cyberguys (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cyberguys.com/">http://www.cyberguys.com/</a>), and <a class="ulink" href="http://newegg.com">Newegg.com</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.newegg.com/">http://www.newegg.com/</a>). A 3-foot cable should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> cost $8 or $10. There's no reason to pay more for "premium" patch cables; any cable that meets the CAT5e specification will do the job. (This piece of advice will probably save you more money than you paid for this book.)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0594"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0595"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0596"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0597"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0598"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In buildings with raised floors or dropped ceilings, it's often convenient to run your data cables through the plenum space above the ceiling or under the floor. However, fire regulations often require special <span class="emphasis"><em>plenum cable</em></span> that won't burn easily and won't produce toxic fumes. Plenum cable is more expensive than regular bulk Ethernet cable, and it's more difficult to use because the jacket is heavier and less flexible, but there's no difference in its data-handling performance. When you're shopping for cable, you might find boxes or spools of plenum cable next to regular CAT5e cable. Sometimes the only difference is a single line on a label. Unless you have a specific need for plenum cable, don't waste your money on the more expensive stuff.</p></div></div>

If you plan to install your own internal wiring, consult some of the do-it-yourself websites or look for a book about home wiring at your local home center before you start.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0599"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0600"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0601"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>I can specifically recommend <span class="emphasis"><em>Wiring Home Networks</em></span> (Sunset Books, 2004) as a guide to installing network wiring, because I wrote it. However, several other illustrated books about home wiring also include the information you need.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0602"/></p></div><p>In order to feed wires from wall plates or surface boxes through your walls to the control center, you will have to drill some holes through base plates, studs, and other structural elements of your house or workplace. If you're working in rooms on the ground floor, you might be able to reach the spaces between the walls from below, drilling upward from an unfinished ceiling in the basement or crawl space. On the top floor, you can work downward from the attic. But if you can't get to the inside of the walls from above or below, your best option will be to cut holes in the wall and drill through the vertical studs, or to hide cables and holes behind mop boards and other moldings. After the wires are in place, you'll have to patch the holes and repaint the walls.</p><p>Use an electrician's snake to pull or push cables through places that you can't reach with your hands. When the end of the snake reaches the target location, attach the end of the bulk cable to the snake with electrical tape and pull the snake and cable back from the other end. It's a lot easier to route wires with a rigid snake (a long, thin piece of metal) than to deal with loose cable flopping around inside a wall.</p><p>Remember to add a length of heavy twine as a pull line along with each cable or cable bundle that you pull through the walls. In the future, when you want to add another cable along the same route, you can attach the cable to the pull line and pull it through without the need to create new holes in your walls.</p><p>You're going to connect a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of cables to and through the control center, so you will want to keep them out of sight in order to maintain a neat and clean appearance. A 2-inch PVC pipe at the back of a closet or in some other hidden location can provide an inconspicuous route for cables between an upper floor or the attic and the basement or crawl space. If the pipe runs through the space where the control center is located, assemble a channel from two shorter pipes and a tee fitting about four or five feet above the floor. Pipes, fittings, and glue are all available at your local hardware store or home center.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Follow the instructions on the package for gluing PVC pipes to fittings, but don't worry about creating watertight seals.

Therefore, you will need either a telephone or cable TV outlet in your control center. This is the same kind of outlet that you are already using to connect a telephone or TV set. If you're getting Internet service from your cable TV company, you can sometimes convince the installer to run a cable to your control center. But if you have DSL or some other type of Internet service from the telephone company, you might have to install your own wiring.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0662"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0663"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0664"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0665"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0666"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0667"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0668"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0669"/></p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="connecting_a_telephone_line"/>Connecting a Telephone Line</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have DSL or some other kind of Internet service from the telephone company, you will need a telephone outlet with a four-pin socket called an <span class="emphasis"><em>RJ-11 jack</em></span>. This is the same kind of socket that you use to plug in a telephone set.</p><p>Mount the outlet block on your panel, about a foot above the power strip. You can use either conventional telephone cable, with two pairs of wires inside, or the same four-pair data cable that you use for your computer network to connect the outlet block on the control panel back to the distribution block that connects your telephones to the service entry. If you use telephone cable, be sure to match the colors of the wires to the letters on the outlet blocks at both ends (R = red, Y = yellow, G = green, and B = black).

If the outlet block has screw terminals, strip about half an inch of insulation off the end of each wire and wrap the bare end around the screw next to the letter that corresponds to the wire's color.</p><p>If the terminal uses two vertical pins with a slot between them to hold each wire, don't strip the wires, but use a punch-down tool to force each wire between the pins. If your terminal does not come with a small punch-down tool, look for one at a home center or hardware store; you will need the same tool to connect data cables to their outlet connectors. If excess wire extends from the side of the connector, cut it off. When all four wires are connected, place the dust cover on the plug.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0670"/></p><p>After you have connected the telephone line to the outlet block, plug in a telephone with a modular RJ-11 cable to test for a dial tone.

If you're not installing your own video distribution system along with your data network, and you have to install your own cable from the service entry to the network control center, it might be easier and cheaper to buy a pre-assembled cable with the connectors already attached (look for a cable close to the length you need—don't use a 100-foot cable for a 20-foot run). Use electrical tape or a cable tie to hold excess lengths of cable in a neat loop at one end.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0681"/></p><p>If you have to install the video cable yourself, find the service entry where the cable comes into your house or office. String the cable along the ceiling or through the rafters under the floor to the control center, then attach the cable to the F connector inside the outlet plate. If there's a splitter with a spare connector at the service entry, screw the plug at the end of the cable onto the unused socket. If you can't find a splitter, you'll have to install a new one, or distribute your video from the control panel.</p><p>If you're not connecting other outlets through the control center, plug the cable from the service entry directly into your cable modem. If you want to use the control panel to distribute cable TV signals to outlets throughout the house, connect the cable from the service entrance to the input of a splitter and connect the outputs to your cable modem and the cables from each room.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0682"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0683"/></p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="terminating_the_network_cables"/>Terminating the Network Cables</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're using a plywood panel as your control center, mount one or two rows of outlet blocks along the top of the panel, or along the side opposite the power strip.

Your goal is to be able to figure out at a glance which terminal block connects to what destination.</p><p>There are two different standard color codes for connecting Ethernet cables to plugs and sockets.

You won't need this phone very often, but when something goes wrong, you will be happy to have it. Use a cell phone or a cordless handset if you have one, or install an inexpensive wall phone on or near the control panel.

The second approach can be particularly convenient when the new location shares a wall with a room that already has a data outlet.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0707"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It's particularly important to label the wall outlets in a network without a control center.
