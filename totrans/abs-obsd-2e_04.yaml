- en: OpenBSD boots into a text console by default. To boot into an X-based graphic
    console, use the `xdm(1)` command in */etc/rc.conf.local*. The default `xdm` setting

    data, but I hadn’t set the system clock yet” is roughly equivalent to saying “I
    don’t care about you or your data.” If you feel that way, I’m not going to argue,
    but at least have the confidence to tell the user what you really think.
