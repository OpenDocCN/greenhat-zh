    tapes back in the olden days. There are many reasons for making your own
    custom-mix discs: to make your own song collections, to make your own
    greatest hits samplers, to combine your best live performances, to make
    party discs, to make a promotional CD of your own music, to weed out songs
    you don’t care for, to condense several CDs or LPs into fewer discs . . .
    whatever your reasons, it’s easy to do with Audacity.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0002" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This newfangled digital era is the best: You can make copies that
    are perfect clones of the originals, and it’s faster and easier to edit
    files on a computer than on tape. Creating your own custom CD goes like
    this: Collect the audio tracks you want to use in Audacity, apply cleanups
    and edits, write your track metadata, export to your desired format, write
    to a CD, and you’re done.</p><div class="sect1" title="Audio CDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="audio_cds"/>Audio CDs</h1></div></div></div><p>There are two types of audio CDs that you can make, and which type
      you choose is determined by your playback devices. The standard CD that
      plays on all CD players is encoded according to the Red Book CD Audio
      standard. This is what commercially recorded CDs use, and this is what
      you want to use to make a universally playable disc. That is no big
      technical deal, because all you do is choose “Create an audio CD” in
      your CD-writing program. You must always create 16/44.1 WAV files for
      Red Book CDs.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The second type of CD you can make is written to the Orange Book
      standard to play on a computer. Again, this is no big technological
      deal; it’s just an ordinary data CD, and in your CD-writing program
      you’ll choose “Create a data CD.” On this type of disc you may use any
      audio file format you want, such as FLAC or 24-bit WAV for higher
      quality or lossy, compressed formats like Ogg Vorbis or MP3 to cram more
      songs onto a disc. You are limited only by your choice of software media
      player, and these days it’s a rare software media player that doesn’t
      support everything under the sun.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0019" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You should verify CD-R and CD-RW support in your CD player. CD-RWs
      are great for creating temporary collections for parties and special
      events, but some CD players don’t handle them very well. Some don’t even
      handle CD-Rs well, but that is pretty rare anymore. Some newer CD/DVD
      players support non–Red Book formats such as MP3, WAV, and WMA.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Alvin, our excellent technical reviewer, explains why older CD
        players have problems reading newer discs. “The older azide-based
        discs had a very large difference in reflectance, and the sensitivity
        of the player was set to this large difference. With CD-RW and the
        pthalocyanine (silver)–based discs, the difference in reflectivity of
        the 0 and 1 (burned vs. unburned) disc is much smaller.”<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0020" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="There Is Not a Special Audio CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="there_is_not_a_special_audio_cd"/>There Is Not a Special Audio CD</h2></div></div></div><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: All blank CDs are
        exactly the same type; there is no such thing as a special audio CD,
        even though you see them in stores. The only special things about them
        are a pressed data flag that is part of the Serial Copy Management
        System (SCMS) to control copying protected material and a copying tax
        that goes to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) or
        its equivalent in other countries. The SCMS encoding controls three
        states: copy allowed (00), copy once (11), and copy prohibited (10).
        It might get in the way if you try to use the kind of CD player that
        attaches to your stereo system to copy a copy of a commercial CD. But
        you can copy the original all you want, and computer hardware and
        media are exempt from being SCSM-compliant.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0022" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are quality differences among brands, and different
        materials are used to make the discs. Taiyo Yuden makes its own discs;
        they are very good and promise the most longevity. Mitsui, Phillips,
        Kodak, Verbatim, and TDK are all reliable as well. The price
        difference between the good brands and the not-so-good brands isn’t
        significant. There is no point in pinching pennies because you’ll just
        create more coasters with the lesser-quality brands, so you won’t save
        any money. See Andy McFadden’s CD-Recordable FAQ (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq.html">http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq.html</a>) to learn all about CD
        media.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0035" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Convert MP3s to Red Book CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="convert_mp3s_to_red_book_cd"/>Convert MP3s to Red Book CD</h2></div></div></div><p>A commonly asked question is “How do I copy my MP3s to a CD that
        will play on every CD player?” They must be converted to 16/44.1 WAV
        files and then Red Book–encoded. To do this, use Audacity to convert
        MP3s to 16/44.1 WAV format, and then in your CD-writing program select
        “Create an audio CD.” It won’t give you WAV quality; it will still be
        lo-fi, lossy MP3 quality. You won’t get more than 80 minutes of music
        on your disc even with the smaller file sizes. But you’ll have a
        standard CD that will play anywhere.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="CD Writers and Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cd_writers_and_software"/>CD Writers and Software</h1></div></div></div><p>These days, most consumer-level CD/DVD burners are pretty good and
      not very expensive, about $40 to $90. External USB burners are portable,
      and some are bus powered so you don’t need a power cord.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0036" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CD-writing software is everywhere. For basic CD writing, you
      shouldn’t have to pay money because there are dozens of freebies. There
      is built-in CD/DVD-writing software in Windows, though it’s pretty
      limited. Nero and Roxio are decent and offer inexpensive editions. For
      more advanced tasks, Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect (Windows
      only) is a decent value in a CD-mastering program at less than $100,
      with professional features such as cross-fades, cue sheets, indexing
      long live tracks, previews, dithering, resampling, karaoke, and DJ
      mixes.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Linux users have three good graphical open source applications to
      choose from: Brasero, Gnome CD Master, and K3b. All are graphical
      frontends to powerful command-line apps such as wodim, cdrdao, and
      various encoders and converters. They, of course, can be used on their
      own without the pretty graphical interfaces.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0041" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Gapless burning</em></span> is a common problem in
      do-it-yourself audio circles. This means creating a CD that plays one
      long, unbroken track, like a live show, with no breaks between songs.
      This can be put together from multiple audio files or from a single long
      WAV file. You need a CD burner that supports gapless burning, which now
      should be all CD/DVD burners. Look for session-at-once (SAO) and
      disc-at-once (DAO) support. Track-at-once (TAO) means the laser pauses
      at the end of each track. SAO burns your whole session in one pass with
      no pauses and leaves the CD open so you can add more tracks, while DAO
      closes the disc. Use SAO or DAO for gapless burning of audio
      CDs.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0042" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0043" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0045" class="indexterm"/></p><p>An extra challenge for CD-authoring software is creating a track
      index for a long, unbroken performance. Create a long WAV track in
      Audacity, and then create CD text and a track index in your CD-writing
      program so you can navigate the disc just like on a CD with multiple
      song tracks. (You can’t create this in Audacity.) You should end up with
      two files: a <span class="emphasis"><em>.bin</em></span> file, which contains your audio,
      and a <span class="emphasis"><em>.cue</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>.toc</em></span> file, which
      contains the disc index. Some CD-authoring applications use their own
      weird nonstandard cue sheet formats; beware of these, because other
      CD-writing programs won’t be able to use them, and they might confuse
      playback devices.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0054" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Roxio, CDRWin, Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect, and
      higher-end suites by Steinberg and Minnetonka are some programs that can
      do this for Windows users. Brasero and Gnome CD Master do the best job
      for Linux users. K3b can index long tracks, but its interface for doing
      this is rather cumbersome.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0056" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0059" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Three Ways to Author a CD Compilation in Audacity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="three_ways_to_author_a_cd_compilation_in"/>Three Ways to Author a CD Compilation in Audacity</h1></div></div></div><p>There are several ways to create a CD compilation in Audacity. One
      way is to copy each song into a single Audacity project, each on its own
      separate track. Edit and apply fixes to each track individually, and
      then normalization across all tracks is a single step. Give each track
      its own name, and there are your song titles. This is a good method for
      creating a typical audio CD with multiple song tracks and a short,
      silent gap between each one.</p><p>Another way is to copy all of your songs into a single stereo
      Audacity track, apply fixes and edits, and then create a label track to
      divide them into individual songs. You can use this to create a CD that
      appears to be a single long, unbroken track by creating nice smooth
      transitions between each song and then making sure there are no gaps
      between the songs when you burn your CD.</p><p>With the first two methods, your final result is a batch of WAV
      files, one file per song.</p><p>A third method is to copy all of your songs into a single stereo
      Audacity track and apply edits and fixes. Export it as a single 16/44.1
      WAV file, and then use your CD-writing program to create song titles and
      divide it into individual song tracks with two-second gaps, or index the
      track so that it remains unbroken but still navigable.</p><p>Each method has its advantages, so let’s look at each one in
      detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="One Track per Song Project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="one_track_per_song_project"/>One Track per Song Project</h2></div></div></div><p>I like this method for creating CDs with multiple song tracks
        and a standard two-second silent gap between each one. You can
        normalize all tracks at once and edit each one individually without
        worrying about inadvertently changing something else. When each song
        in your project is on its own track, it looks like <a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#putting_each_song_on_its_own_track" title="Figure 5-1. Putting each song on its own track">Figure 5-1</a>.</p><p>Your first step is to create a new Audacity project by selecting
        <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project As</strong></span>. Next, configure Audacity
        with the following settings for creating CD-ready WAV files.</p><p>Set the frame rate to CD audio in the Selection toolbar, as

        This ensures that any splits you make will start and end on a CD
        frame. Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and
        possibly create clicking noises. You can choose either hh:mm:ss + CDDA
        frames (75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time
        plus CD frames, and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the
        “Snap To” box to ensure that stops and starts are always on the CD
        frame boundaries. Set the Project Rate value to 44,100 Hz.</p><div class="figure"><a id="putting_each_song_on_its_own_track"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e7637"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797549.png.jpg" alt="Putting each song on its own track"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-1. Putting each song on its own track</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_the_cd_frame_rate_and_project"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e7645"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797551.png.jpg" alt="Selecting the CD frame rate and project rate in the Selection toolbar"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-2. Selecting the CD frame rate and project rate in the Selection

        WAV, FLAC, or some other format, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>. If you want to copy tracks or clips
        from another Audacity project, open the other project in a new window
        and copy and paste.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0062" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Name each track with the song name in the Track menu. (At
        export, each track will be exported into individual WAV files that use
        the track names as filenames.)</p><p>Next, apply edits and repairs. (See <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html" title="Fixes and Cleanups">Fixes and Cleanups</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html" title="Fixes and Cleanups">Fixes and Cleanups</a>.) I like to put one second of silence
        at the beginning and end of each track and normalize all of them to 0
        dB. Then as I build my CD-ready WAV collection, they’re all ready to
        go and don’t need any more processing in Audacity.</p><p>Make sure that your Project Rate setting is still 44,100 Hz. If
        the first track you opened or imported was at a different sampling
        rate, then that would have become the project rate. It doesn’t matter
        if you have mixed sampling rates, because everything will be resampled
        to the project rate at export.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0064" class="indexterm"/></p><p>An optional step at this point is to enter some metadata by

        information such as the album title, year, genre, and comments. This
        is saved only in your Audacity project because WAV files do not
        support metadata. (Other audio file formats do, such as FLAC, MP3, and
        Ogg Theora.) Audacity will automatically fill in each track title from
        your track names, the track number, and everything you entered in the
        Metadata Editor.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0066" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you want to review the metadata for each song as it is

        &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Recent
        Files</strong></span>, and copy and paste. To add audio files such as WAV,
        FLAC, Ogg Theora, and so forth, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>. Each new import will open in its own
        track, so you will have to cut and paste it into your compilation
        track and then delete the extra track.</p><p>When you have all the songs you want, apply edits and repairs
        (see <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html" title="Fixes and Cleanups">Fixes and Cleanups</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html" title="Fixes and Cleanups">Fixes and Cleanups</a>). If your songs vary in volume and you
        want them all the same, you’ll have to adjust each one individually
        using <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span>. Select each song one at a time, and
        then bring them up to your desired peak amplitude, no more than
        zero.</p><p>Now create a label track. This is how each song gets a title and
        how this one long track will be split into a bunch of separate song
        files. Start by pressing the <span class="keycap">home</span> key
        to make sure you are at the very beginning, and then press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-B to create the label. Type in the song
        title and press the <span class="keycap">return</span> key. Click
        at the beginning of the second song, make another label, and keep
        going until you’re finished labeling all the songs (<a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#creating_a_label_track" title="Figure 5-5. Creating a label track">Figure 5-5</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0076" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_label_track"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e7929"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797557.png.jpg" alt="Creating a label track"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-5. Creating a label track</p></div><p>Make sure your project rate in the Selection toolbar is still
        44,100. Any clips that have a different sample rate will be resampled
        to the project rate at export.</p><p>If you’d like, you can enter some metadata, but remember that
        the information is saved only in your Audacity project—WAV files do
        not support metadata. To export your project for CD recording, see
        <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html" title="Final Export">Final Export</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html" title="Final Export">Final Export</a>.
        When you are finished, you will see a confirmation for each song and a
        summary as in <a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#a_successful_multiple_export" title="Figure 5-3. A successful multiple export">Figure 5-3</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Single Audacity Track + CD-Mastering Program"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="single_audacity_track_plus_cd-mastering"/>Single Audacity Track + CD-Mastering Program</h2></div></div></div><p>This third method requires a good CD-authoring program that
        supports CD text, track splitting, and control of the spacing between
        tracks. The idea is to create a single long Audacity track with all of
        your songs and do your cleanups and fixes in Audacity. Then export it
        as a single 16/44.1 WAV file and use your CD-writing program to create
        song titles, to divide the track into individual songs and adjust the
        gaps between songs, or to create an index without breaking up the
        track.</p><p>There are many CD-authoring applications that can do this, such
        as Roxio, CDRWin, Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect, and
        higher-end suites by Steinberg and Minnetonka for Windows users.
        Brasero and Gnome CD Master are best for Linux users.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0079" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0080" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0081" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Let’s use Brasero to illustrate how to do this, because it has
        the simplest interface. First, create your new audio project and load
        your audio file. Then right-click your file and click <span class="strong"><strong>Split File</strong></span>. This opens Brasero’s Split Track
        window (<a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#using_brasero_to_split_a_long_track" title="Figure 5-6. Using Brasero to split a long track">Figure 5-6</a>).
        Select Method: Split track manually, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button to hear your track, and click
        <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> to mark a song break.</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_brasero_to_split_a_long_track"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e7983"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797559.png.jpg" alt="Using Brasero to split a long track"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-6. Using Brasero to split a long track</p></div><p>Drag the Play slider back and forth to find split points

        What if you want song breaks? No worries: Just right-click any track
        to insert a two-second pause (<a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#using_brasero_to_insert_breaks_between_s" title="Figure 5-8. Using Brasero to insert breaks between songs">Figure 5-8</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0082" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="using_brasero_to_insert_breaks_between_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e8018"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797563.png.jpg" alt="Using Brasero to insert breaks between songs"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-8. Using Brasero to insert breaks between songs</p></div><p>If your long track is a compilation of songs with the usual

      that applies to cleaning up compilation CDs too. We’ll review the basics
      here along with explanations of a few other fixes that may come up when
      you make your compilation discs. We’ll talk about splitting stereo
      tracks for more precise editing, normalization, adjusting the gaps
      between songs, and graceful fades. See <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Fix-its and Cleanups">Chapter 12</a> to learn more about fix-its and

        two-channel stereo track. If you split this into two tracks, then you
        can apply repairs to just the one channel and then join the tracks
        back together. There are a couple of advantages to this: The second
        track helps to mask a less-than-perfect fix, and the fix that you
        apply to the defective portion probably won’t help the other channel
        sound any better and may even hurt the quality.</p><p>To divide a stereo track, go to the Track menu and click
        <span class="strong"><strong>Split Stereo Track</strong></span>. To rejoin the

        different songs to the same volume levels, is a common audio-editing
        task that can be done in CD-writing software. But again, in Audacity
        you have a lot more control.</p><p>Before normalizing, you should review your tracks for any
        unusual peaks that could indicate some kind of defect, such as a
        bumped mic, a cough, something dropped, or anything that is so loud it
        doesn’t sound right. Normalization doesn’t change the dynamic range,
        so one too-loud peak means normalization won’t have much effect, and
        you could end up with a track that is too quiet overall. To lower the
        volume on any too-loud peak, zoom in until you can select it
        precisely, and then open <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span>
        &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span>. Enter a negative
        value, like -3 dB, to lower the volume. You can use the Preview button
        to help adjust it. When it sounds right, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, and move on to the next one.</p><p>If you put your whole project into a single Audacity track,
        you’ll have to select each song carefully and raise it to your desired
        maximum volume level. You should do this before creating any fades.
        Another way to handle this is to use the Envelope tool so you can fix
        it all with one tool.</p><p>When every song is on its own individual track, it’s
        easier—select all tracks (<span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-A or
        <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Select All</strong></span>), and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Normalize</strong></span>. Check both “Remove any CD offset”
        and “Normalize maximum amplitude to,” and enter your maximum volume
        level up to 0 dB.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Making Graceful Fades and Song Breaks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="making_graceful_fades_and_song_breaks"/>Making Graceful Fades and Song Breaks</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating breaks between songs, with graceful fades in and out,
        is easy in Audacity. Many CD-writing programs can do this too, but you
        have more control in Audacity. There are three Audacity tools that I
        like to use: the Fade In/Fade Out effects, the Envelope tool, and the
        Silence generator.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0105" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Fade In/Fade Out effect is fast and simple; all you control
        is the length of the fade. First, select the segment that you want to
        fade, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Fade Out</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Fade
        In</strong></span>.</p><p>If you need to insert an interval of pure silence, use the
        Selection tool to mark where you want the silence to begin, click
        <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Silence</strong></span>, set it to whatever duration you
        want, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p><p>The Envelope tool gives you more control of both the duration
        and the degree of fades. <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html#using_the_envelope_tool_and_the_time_shi" title="Figure 5-9. Using the Envelope tool and the Time Shift tool to create fade-ins and fade-outs">Figure 5-9</a> shows it in
        action, creating about a 2.5-second fade-out to silence and then
        fading back in. The little squares are the <span class="emphasis"><em>node control
        points</em></span>. Create these by clicking the track, and then you
        can move them both horizontally and vertically. To get rid of a node,
        grab a control point and drag it outside the track’s boundary.
        Envelope tools are standard in most audio-editing applications. It
        takes a bit of practice to get the hang of them, but once you figure
        out how to make them go where you want, you gain a high degree of
        control over fades and amplitude.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0106" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0107" class="indexterm"/></p><p>What about cross-fades, you ask? A cross-fade is when one track
        fades out and another fades in at the same time, with some overlap and
        no break. Cross-fades are used all the time in soundtracks and music.
        Some Audacity plug-ins for creating cross-fades are included in the
        standard add-on plug-in packages, but they’re pretty limited. I think
        it’s easier and better to use the Envelope tool. Someday Audacity will
        have a good cross-fade tool. Meanwhile, <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html#creating_a_cross-fade_with_the_envelope" title="Figure 5-10. Creating a cross-fade with the Envelope tool">Figure 5-10</a> shows my

        Envelope tool on each track to set the length and degree of fade. When
        it’s just the way you want, you’ll have to mix down the two tracks
        into a single stereo track. If you want to create a lot of cross-fades
        in a project, use two separate Audacity tracks as in <a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html#creating_cross-fades_between_every_song" title="Figure 5-11. Creating cross-fades between every song by using the Time Shift tool and the Envelope tool">Figure 5-11</a>. Then you’ll have

        will sound just like the playback in Audacity sounds, so when it
        sounds right in Audacity, it’s ready to go. Channel assignments are
        controlled in the Track menus: Left, Right, and Mono. Left is channel

        a CD, you don’t need Audacity at all. Just open your CD writer and
        create a new data CD project. Copy your files to the CD, enter CD text
        if you want, burn the disc, and you’re done.</p><p>There are a couple of different ways to assemble an Orange Book
        CD project in Audacity. Remember, your audio files are treated as
        ordinary data files, so you can use any audio file format that is
        supported by your media player. If the CD will contain all the same
        formats and quality settings, such as all FLAC or all Ogg Vorbis or
        all MP3, you can follow the same steps as for a Red Book CD, which is
        to create a single Audacity project containing all of your songs.
        Export to your desired format and quality. Then in your CD-writing
        program, select “Create a data CD” instead of creating an audio CD. If
        you created track metadata, it will be displayed in CD players that
        support it (except for WAV files, which do not support storing
        metadata).</p><p>The first audio file you open will set the project rate. You can
        resample audio files to different sampling rates, but this can hurt
        audio quality. Upsampling doesn’t add more quality, just more bits.
        Downsampling throws away bits. A good tactic is not to mix up files in
        Audacity but rather to edit files that have the same sampling rate in
        a single Audacity project. After export, you can mix and match them
        all you like.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0125" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0126" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0127" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0128" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0129" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0130" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0131" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0132" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You won’t be able to apply normalization or adjust the breaks
        between the tracks in your CD-writing program because it won’t see the
        files as audio files. Apply normalization in Audacity and make sure
        every track is normalized to the same level, like 0 dB or whatever you
        prefer. Adjust the gaps between songs in Audacity in the usual way,
        with fades and silences.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0133" class="indexterm"/></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html#a_mixed_flac_comma_mp3_comma_and_wav_cd" title="Figure 5-12. A mixed FLAC, MP3, and WAV CD compilation in Amarok">Figure 5-12</a> shows

        great choices for highest quality, and Ogg Vorbis and MP3 are good
        lossy, compressed formats when you need to save space.</p><p>An Orange Book CD supports all WAV files, so you can use 16- or
        24-bit and whatever sampling rate you prefer.</p><p>Online music services such as Magnatune, Pristine Classical, and
        Grooveshark offer downloads in FLAC format because it is equal in
        quality to WAV in a smaller file size.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0135" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0136" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0137" class="indexterm"/></p><p>FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit depths and has nine
        compression levels, from 0 to 8 (<a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html#flacs_are_lossless_and_a_great_choice_fo" title="Figure 5-13. FLACs are lossless and a great choice for Orange Book CDs.">Figure 5-13</a>). The default is
        5, and that is a good one to stick with, though nobody will mind if
        you experiment with the others. The different settings are different
        levels of compression, with 0 being the least compression and 8 the
        most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in quality, only in
        how much the files are compressed. The value 8 takes several times
        longer to encode than 5 with not much additional benefit. Decoding
        FLAC files that have been maximally compressed doesn’t take any longer
        than decoding ones that have been lightly compressed, so the degree of
        compression won’t affect playback.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0138" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0139" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0140" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0141" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0142" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0143" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0144" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0145" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0146" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0147" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0148" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0149" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0150" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0151" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0152" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0153" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Ogg Vorbis is also an open and unencumbered format. It has 11
        quality settings in Audacity, from 0 to 10 (<a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html#ogg_vorbis_is_a_good-quality_lossy_comma" title="Figure 5-14. Ogg Vorbis is a good-quality lossy, compressed audio format.">Figure 5-14</a>). The value 3 is
        roughly equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3, which is pretty lo-fi. I think 6
        is good for music. Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling for all levels up
        to 5, which means that redundancies between two stereo channels are
        combined to save bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of stereo
        imaging. Channel coupling is not used at levels 6 and up. I don’t
        perceive any gain in going greater than 7, though your ears may tell
        you differently.</p><div class="figure"><a id="flacs_are_lossless_and_a_great_choice_fo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e8606"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797573.png.jpg" alt="FLACs are lossless and a great choice for Orange Book CDs."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-13. FLACs are lossless and a great choice for Orange Book

        though I have not heard of small-time musicians getting sued for
        royalties. Nobody will know what you use on your own personal music
        discs anyway.</p><p>MP3 supports both variable and constant bitrates. Constant
        bitrates are best for Internet streaming. Variable bitrate MP3s are
        good for a Orange Book CD because they often sound better than
        constant bitrate files. A constant bitrate means the same fixed
        bitrate is used throughout the file, even if it needs more or fewer
        bits in certain passages. Variable bitrate operates within a range
        that you select, using more or fewer bits as needed. For my ears, a
        variable 170 to 210Kbps MP3 sounds as good as higher-bitrate MP3s, and
        it sounds better than the lower bitrates (<a class="xref" href="ch05s06.html#mp3s_at_170_to_210kbps_sound_okay_to_me" title="Figure 5-15. MP3s at 170 to 210Kbps sound okay to me, better than lower bitrates and as good as higher bitrates.">Figure 5-15</a>). Naturally it is

      your own digital audio file archives, but what about plucking songs off
      CDs? The audio tracks on a CD are written using a special format, the
      Red Book CD Audio standard, so you can’t just copy the songs off a CD
      but must use a special digital audio extractor, or <span class="emphasis"><em>CD
      ripper</em></span>. Some CD-writing programs include rippers, such as
      Nero (Windows and Linux) and K3b (Linux). There are multitudes of
      standalone CD rippers for all platforms. For example, Windows users can
      try Windows Media Player, Audio Grabber, or the excellent Exact Audio
      Copy. Exact Audio Copy has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get
      it set up for your system, it is fast and accurate, and it handles
      damaged CDs better than any of the others. Linux users have, among many
      others, the excellent Grip, KAudiocreator, and VLC Media
      Player.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0159" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0160" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0161" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0162" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0163" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0164" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0165" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0166" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0167" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CD rippers extract tracks directly from the CD, so you don’t need
      a sound card. This how you make a true, 100 percent faithful clone of
      the original. You could also intercept the playback signal in various
      ways and record that, such as connecting your CD player directly to a
      recording interface using its RCA connectors, using the line or
      headphone port on your stereo amplifier, or even holding a microphone in
      front of your speakers. But these techniques won’t produce a perfect
      copy; they might introduce some flaws, lose a bit of fidelity, or
      introduce some alterations such as a different treble/bass curve. This
      is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>analog hole</em></span>, which is yet another
      silly ogre invented by people in the entertainment industry who seem to
      have no understanding of audio technology. You don’t need to be an audio
      engineer to understand that the ultimate fate of the digital bits on a
      CD is to be converted into an analog signal that we can listen to and
      that anything that we hear can be recorded.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0168" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Different tactics have been tried in futile attempts to “close the
      analog hole,” such as introducing deliberate distortions and signal
      degradations to foil copying, getting laws passed to cripple the
      functionality of audio and video players, keying playback to watermarks
      so that only signals bearing the correct, approved watermarks will play
      back at all, and putting backdoors in devices that allow vendors to shut
      them down remotely or control them in other ways. It’s a losing arms
      race because anything that is invented can be circumvented, and
      customers are unwilling to leap tall buildings just to hear their
      music.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0169" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0170" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Audio CDs are rarely copy-protected anyway, and the few attempts
      that have been made were public failures. Sony BMG was rather severely
      embarrassed when it was discovered that its copy protection secretly
      installed rootkits on Windows PCs, which violated laws in various
      countries and opened security holes. In the United States, Sony BMG
      admitted that it violated federal law and had to deal with a number of
      civil lawsuits. This so-called copy protection did not work on anything
      but Windows PCs, so Linux and Mac users and owners of standalone CD
      players and mass CD duplicators were not affected.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0171" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Rippers are useful for recovering tracks from your own CDs and
      from deteriorating out-of-print commercial CDs.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In this era of “intellectual property” protection craziness (at
        least in the United States), the principle of fair use has taken a
        beating. I’m not going to offer legal advice because I’m not
        qualified, and it would deteriorate into a rant anyway. I do want to
        offer a gentle reminder that the other extreme of disregarding
        copyrights is just as wrong, and no, we are not entitled to everything
        for free. And it doesn’t require legal genius for a person to
        recognize when they’re taking unfair advantage.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0172" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0173" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Specialized CD rippers cater mainly to the MP3 crowd, so watch
      your file formats. Most CD and DVD rippers support exporting to a number
      of different audio file formats, such as Ogg, WAV, FLAC, AAC, WMA, and
      MP3. For best quality, always rip the native format, which for Red Book
      CDs is always WAV. Once you have ripped your tracks, you can then edit
      them in Audacity just like any other digital audio file and export to
      any other formats you want.</p></div>

      VLC also runs on Windows. Try VLC first; it is open source, is free of
      cost, and has the most features. With VLC, you can extract and transcode
      your DVD audio tracks into almost any format. Again, you’ll get best
