    than it is in the analog world. No waiting for tapes to rewind, no physically
    cutting and pasting tapes—it’s all just pointy-clicky bit shuffling. Although
    Audacity isn’t the most sophisticated application for heavy-duty multitrack recording
    and editing, you can make excellent mono and stereo recordings with it and even
    5.1 and 7.1 surround sound. It’s the real deal, with discrete tracks.

    term in audio because it tells you when you’re getting the real deal, and not
    something simulated. For example, a surround sound hi-fi system will emulate 5.1
    sound from a stereo recording, which has only two discrete channels. Real 5.1
    has six discrete channels.

    and you can’t make edits while tracks are playing. When you’re using a multichannel
    recording device, you can’t control which input goes to which track. Multichannel
    surround mixing is still rather rudimentary: You can export to 5.1 and 7.1 surround,
    but Audacity gives you no help mapping the channels. Audacity’s strengths lie
    in recording, editing, and mixing for mono and stereo playback. Ardour might be
    a better choice for Linux and Mac users who want to perform heavy-duty studio
    wizardry, perform multichannel surround, and have maximum control, and of course
    Windows and Mac users have great thundering herds of other high-end audio production
    suites to choose from.'

    recording interface supports and your computer can handle. Some examples of multichannel
    recording interfaces are the M-Audio Delta 1010 PCI sound card (10 × 10), the
    Edirol FA-101 FireWire audio interface (10 × 10), the RME Hammerfall sound cards,
    and the M-Audio NRV10, which is a useful combination of an analog mixer and 10-channel
    FireWire DAC/ADC.

    and synchronize, layer multiple copies of the same track or clip, do fix-its and
    special effects, and mixdown to any number of channels from 1 to 32 (WAV, AIFF,

    "Figure 9-1. This is what a single mono track looks like—one waveform, no matter
    how many voices or instruments are recorded on the track."). I call this a mono
    track to make it clear that it’s not a stereo track. However, the definition of
    *track* is a bit fuzzy in audio and also in Audacity because it treats a stereo
    track the same way it treats a mono track—even though there are two channels with
    two different waveforms, Audacity sees a stereo track as one track, and everything
    you do to it is applied equally to both channels. A track is also a single song
    in a track, CD, LP, or tape that contains several songs.

    its own mic. Studio recording is nothing like live recording—sometimes every performer
    is in a separate soundproof cubicle, or recorded at different times and different
    locations, so the various band members might never even be physically present
    at the same time. It’s a common practice to use multiple mics on a single performer
    and then manipulate the resulting multiple tracks to create absolute perfect wonderfulness
    (or an overproduced glop, as the case may be).

    the power on, or at least make sure all volume controls are at zero. Turn power
    off before unplugging. Most audio equipment is tolerant of a certain amount of
    abuse. But pops from hotplugging are annoying and may damage your equipment.

    low-frequency effects (LFE)—you could take a single mono track and export it to

    using Audacity’s custom export mixer") shows. I don’t know why you would want
    to, but it’s there if you do. Audacity supports a maximum of 32 output channels.
    If you have a playback device that supports 32 channels, you will have yourself
    one heck of a fun time. A more realistic option for all those channels is to export
    them to a single 32-bit WAV file, or 32 individual WAV files (using **File** >
    **Export Multiple**), and then import them into a more sophisticated mixing application
    for advanced mixing and studio wizardry. For example, some users like to record
    and edit in Audacity and then do the final mix in a different program that does
    things Audacity doesn’t do, such as support MIDI, or that has more sophisticated
    multitrack mixing. Since Audacity is free, it doesn’t cost anything but some time
    to try different workflows.

    is really a stereo recording interface with only two discrete input and output

    two. This once again illustrates that in the great wide world of audio, there

    will time-shift the new track by whatever the latency correction value is. This
    time shift is indicated in the usual way with a pair of arrows on the left side
    of the waveform ([Figure 9-26](ch09s07.html#automatic_application_of_latency_correct

    A simple method is to record a click or metronome track and then overdub a vocal
    track where you try to match the click track. Sure, you might feel silly saying
    “tick tick tick” or “ONE two three four” into a microphone, but it works. Make
    sure that the “Snap To” checkbox on the Selection toolbar is not checked and keep
    adjusting the latency value until it sounds right.

- en: A more precise method is to measure latency using a loopback cable. This might
    sound exotic, but all you’re doing is connecting the playback output of your recording
    interface back to the recording input. If it’s an internal sound card, connect
    the line out to the line in. If it’s a USB or FireWire interface, it’s going to
    depend on your device and what kind of connectors it has, but the task is still
    the same—connect playback out to record in.

    177 ms, which is a lot. If you want, you can zoom way in to get the most precise
    measurement. You’ll probably never get zero latency, but you can get close. Latency
    correction for overdubbing always takes a negative value, because the new track
    always lags behind the old track. If you change your recording interface, you
    should repeat the loopback test, because different devices have different latencies.

    a bit of perspective. It’s no good going for super-low latency at the cost of
    stability or creating skips and stutters because your CPU can’t keep up. Latency
    matters during overdubbing, and Audacity helps you with its configurable latency
    correction. It matters when you use software monitoring, which is why I prefer
    using recording interfaces with zero-latency monitoring ports. It matters anywhere
    you have additional stops in your audio chain such as outboard special-effects

    television in North America, some South American countries, and a few other countries.
    The NTSC drop frame rate is 29.97 frames per second (fps), and the NTSC nondrop
    frame rate is 30 fps. Audacity supports both. Why two? Why the odd 29.97 number?
    This is an old standard dating from the black-and-white TV era. The black-and-white
    broadcast frame rate was true 30 fps, but when color was added to the broadcast
    signal, the frame rate, for various technical reasons, was slowed down to 29.97
    fps. Now pay close attention, because I am going to call on all of my mighty explaining
    powers to explain the difference between drop and nondrop NTSC frame rates in
    a way that ordinary, non-video-engineer mortals can understand. This has never
    been done in the history of humanity; you’re seeing it here first.

    of the program, but just a tiny difference in how fast it is played back. The
    term *drop* is unfortunate because it is commonly believed that video frames are
    dropped, but this is not true. Video time is measured by counting video frames.
    When you shoot one hour’s worth of video at true nondrop 30 fps, your one-hour
    project will contain exactly 108,000 frames. If it is broadcast without first
    being converted to drop frame, it will run about 1 hour and 3.6 seconds, because
    at a 29.97 frame rate there are 107,892 frames per hour. So, at the end of an
    hour, there are 108 frames left over.'

    into the drop frame timecode. With NTSC drop frame, your film is played at 30
    fps, but it pretends to be 29.97 fps because that is the requirement for NTSC
    TV broadcast. Every video frame is counted until that 1 percent difference adds
    up to a whole frame. Then the timecode pretends that frame does not exist and
    does not count it, and continues counting on the next frame. So even though your
    film still has its original 108,000 frames, the forgetful timecode plays what
    it thinks are only 107,892 frames in one hour, but it’s really 108,000\. Since
    it has fooled itself into not seeing those other 108 frames they get played anyway,
    the film ends on time, and everyone is happy.

- en: The LFE channel is commonly thought of as the subwoofer channel. This is not
    quite correct because it is not the same as the signal that is sent to the subwoofer
    port. It’s a special channel for carrying sounds in the 3 to 200 Hz range, and
    the LFE signal can be sent to any speaker capable of handling it.

    Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs") for more on DVD-Audio.) Don’t bother with surround
    sound for CDs because they only support two-channel stereo.

    Audacity is very good at creating high-quality stereo and mono tracks, but its
    abilities to manage multitrack surround are rather limited. You must know the
    correct channel mappings yourself for different file formats because Audacity
    does not tell you, and when you import a multichannel audio file into Audacity,
    it loses the track names and channel mappings even if the file was created in
    Audacity.

- en: You can test your channel mappings after export by playing your new audio file
    on your computer, if your computer has a multichannel surround sound card and
    it is already set up and working correctly. See [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Configuring
    Linux for Best Audio Quality") to learn how to set up and test surround sound
    playback on Linux computers. Windows users will find configuration and testing
    tools in the Sound module of the Control Panel, and Windows Media Player supports
    surround sound.

    play it on a surround hi-fi system. Yet another way is to play the file on a digital
    music server that serves a surround hi-fi system.
