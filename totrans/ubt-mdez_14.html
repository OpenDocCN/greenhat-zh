Yes, Linux does indeed rock, and in this chapter you will find out about the musical talents that your system possesses and how it can work with the musical talents that you possess. You will learn how to rip CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files (files that you can recognize by their <span class="emphasis"><em>.mp3</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>.ogg</em></span> filename extensions), add album cover art, change file tags, play music files, and burn files onto audio CDs that you can play in any CD player. You’ll also learn about a number of applications that can help the musician within you. If you’re interested in learning how to work with your iPod, iPhone, iPad, or other digital media device, or how to convert audio files from one format to another, however, you’ll have to wait until <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Pluggin’ In the Penguin">Chapter 15</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0001"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Where the Apps Are"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_the_apps_are-id2"/>Where the Apps Are</h1></div></div></div><p>All of apps in this chapter can be run from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking the Media filter button. As with all applications, you can also run an app by typing its name in the Dash’s search box and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0009"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Audio File Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="audio_file_formats"/>Audio File Formats</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we go any further, it’s probably best to discuss the various formats in which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the .wav extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.au</em></span> extension), and AIFF (from Apple and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.aiff</em></span> extension), all of which are uncompressed formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly large, with an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB per minute. To put that in perspective, back in 1988 my first Macintosh had a 40MB hard disk—more space than I thought I would ever need but not enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s “Come as You Are.”</p><p>As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they are today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about those disk space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus developed. These compression formats work, to oversimplify things a bit, by cutting out the portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear—sort of a dog-whistle approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio compression formats is <span class="emphasis"><em>MP3</em></span>. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality.</p><p>Another audio compression format is <span class="emphasis"><em>Ogg Vorbis</em></span>. Ogg Vorbis is a product of the open source community, so, unlike MP3, which has always been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, it was free of patent and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of that and the fact that it was the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not, as many claim, better), Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the Linux community.</p><p>As you rip audio files in this chapter, you are sure to notice yet another encoding option—FLAC. <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)</em></span> is an encoding format that, unlike the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats, does not remove any audio information from the audio file during the encoding process. The downside is that FLAC provides space savings of only 30 to 50 percent, much less than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. The upside, of course, is that the FLAC files should be equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0010"/></p><p>Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC is an ideal choice if you are not satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 files. It’s also a good choice if you want to create both Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files . . . or if you just don’t know which one you want to work with yet. In such cases, you can go ahead and encode it in FLAC format. As I mentioned earlier, once you get to <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Pluggin’ In the Penguin">Chapter 15</a>, you will learn how you can convert the FLAC file later, when you know what you want or need.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0012"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="installing_mp3_support_for_audio_apps"/>Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps</h1></div></div></div><p>All that talk about Ogg Vorbis and FLAC aside, many people still like or need to deal with MP3 files. You may, for example, already have numerous MP3 files ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy listening to one of the many Internet radio streams that are broadcast in MP3 format. Unfortunately, MP3 playback and encoding support is not included in Ubuntu because of licensing concerns. Even if you plan on using the Ogg Vorbis format in your future ripping and encoding endeavors, installing MP3 support is a good idea so as to cover all your audio bases. It’s also a very easy process. In fact, if you opted to install third-party software support when you originally installed Ubuntu, you most likely already have all the support files you need.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-14-0014"/></p><p>If you did not opt to install third party software when you first installed Ubuntu, then the easiest way to install MP3 playback support is to double-click an MP3 file that you have on your hard disk. A window will appear, asking whether you want to search for the plug-ins necessary to play the file. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Search</strong></span>, after which another window will appear showing you what you need to install (<a class="xref" href="ch14.html#ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n" title="Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.">Figure 14-1</a>). Check both boxes in that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> button, and in the confirmation window that appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Confirm</strong></span>. You will be asked for your password, so provide it and then just wait until the process is complete. Once done, you’ll be able to play not only your MP3 audio files but also a variety of other audio and even video formats.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e15732"/><img alt="Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263838.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Rhythmbox—Ubuntu’s Default Audio Player"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="rhythmboxmubuntuas_default_audio_player"/>Rhythmbox—Ubuntu’s Default Audio Player</h1></div></div></div><p>The main audio player in Ubuntu, called Rhythmbox (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#the_rhythmbox_audio_player" title="Figure 14-2. The Rhythmbox audio player">Figure 14-2</a>), functions pretty much like a simplified version of Apple’s iTunes application.

Rhythmbox should automatically import everything you have in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder without any extra work on your part. If it for some reason does not, or if you would like to also add music from another directory, you can do so by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> menu, selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Import Folder</strong></span>, and then navigating to the folder for the new album you want to add.</p><p>If you prefer things not be so automatic and would like to add only what you want, you can open the preferences window (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>), click the Music tab, and then uncheck the Watch my library for new files box. After that, you can add new albums or groups to your Rhythmbox Library by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Import Folder</strong></span>.

Keep an eye on that so as not to queue up more than your disc can hold. Once you are ready, the process is just as described in the previous section: Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> in the setup window that appears after that.
