    about aiming an antenna at a nearby building or a hillside 5 or 10 miles away
    to create a cheap, high speed, two-way data link. Some experimenters and tinkerers
    with more time than money have even designed their own antennas out of tin cans,
    potato chip canisters, and junk from their basement workshops. They have generally
    discovered that Wi-Fi links can be a reliable way to move data across a lot of
    ground.

    network links. A *point-to-point wireless link* can be part of a larger Wi-Fi
    network, it can act as a simple bridge between two wired LANs, or it can add a
    single distant site to an existing LAN. Point-to-point service differs from other
    Wi-Fi networks because it moves data between two specific locations rather than
    broadcasting a network signal to any network client within range of the radio
    signal. It's also possible to use Wi-Fi as part of a wireless gateway that provides
    Internet access to a community or an isolated location where affordable landlines
    are not available.

    can cost more than the network adapter, but comparable pigtails are also available
    at less than a third of the adapter maker's prices from several other sources,
    including Fleeman Anderson & Bird ([http://www.fab-corp.com](http://www.fab-corp.com))
    and HyperLink Technologies ([http://www.hyperlinktech.com](http://www.hyperlinktech.com)).
    The small cables used for pigtails can often be the most poorly shielded component
    in your network; always keep pigtails as short as possible to maximize the signal
    strength.

- en: Many community network enthusiasts have designed and built their own antennas
    out of odd hardware, plastic spacers, copper wire, and empty cans. Depending on
    the contents of your junk box and your pantry, the materials for a homemade high-gain
    directional antenna might cost as little as three or four dollars, not counting
    the price of a can of coffee, beef stew, or potato chips. If you have to go out
    and buy all the parts and hand tools necessary for the project, you might spend
    $20 or more.

- en: However, when you add the value of the time necessary to assemble the antenna
    and tweak it for optimal performance, it's not at all clear that rolling your
    own would be less expensive than buying an inexpensive commercial antenna. It's
    not unusual to spend three to six hours or more assembling one of these "cheap"
    home brew antennas. A few minutes of online searching (look for "2.4 GHz antenna")
    should find several sources for store-bought directional antennas under $25 that
    will work at least as well as the ones you can build. Keep in mind that your access
    point or network client adapter doesn't need an antenna that can handle high power,
    so you can get by with a relatively lightweight unit.

- en: The most common type of directional antenna for point-to-point communication
    is called a *yagi*, or more properly, a Yagi-Uda antenna system. It was named
    for the two Japanese engineers, Professor Hidetsugu Yagi and Professor Shintaro
    Uda of Tohuku University, who designed and constructed the first ones around 1926\.
    A typical yagi antenna, like the one shown in [Figure 10-7](ch10s06.html#a_yagi_antenna_has_one_active_element_on
    "Figure 10-7. A yagi antenna has one active element, one reflector, and several
    directors."), has a single active element whose length is exactly half the wavelength
    of the radio frequency at which the antenna will operate (at 2.4 GHz, that's about
    2.35 inches). Quarter-wavelength elements will also work. Additional elements,
    called reflectors and directors, are located parallel to the active element at
    very specific intervals determined by the size of the active element. Reflectors
    are located behind the active element, while the directors are in front of it.
    Most of the rooftop television aerials that were common before the days of cable
    and satellites were yagis.

- en: A yagi always has just one reflector, which is about 5 percent longer than the
    active element, and several directors, which are about 5 percent shorter than
    the active element (each additional director should be slightly shorter than the
    one behind it). As you add more elements to a yagi, the amount of gain increases.
    If you want to consider building a yagi of your own, take a look at Rob Flickenger's
    antenna built inside a Pringles potato chip can at [http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448).

- en: 'Many designs for home brew 2.4 GHz yagi antennas use one-inch washers as reflectors,
    directors, and active elements. This will work, but it''s not ideal for two reasons:
    First, at 2.437 GHz (the center frequency of Wi-Fi channel 6) a quarter-wavelength
    active element should be about 1.16 inches long, so those washers are about 16
    percent smaller than they ought to be for ideal performance; and second, the reflector
    and directors are the same size as the active element, which reduces the gain
    (or sensitivity) of the antenna. But considering that the whole thing was built
    out of about $7 worth of parts, it''s close enough. If a pair of these antennas
    gets your signal from here to there and back again at high speed, it really doesn''t
    matter that the reflectors and directors aren''t exactly the right size.'

- en: A yagi isn't the only type of directional antenna that lends itself to build-it-yourself
    designs. Waveguide antennas, with a radiating element inside a reflective metal
    cylinder or cone, use another extremely effective design. The antenna's performance
    depends on the size of the enclosure, the length of the radiating element, and
    its exact position. Greg Rehm's instructions for assembling a tin can waveguide
    antenna are online at [http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html](http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html).

    home brew antennas, it appears that they''re both effective and cheap, especially
    if you don''t include the value of your time when you calculate the cost. It''s
    all a matter of attitude: If you thought "that sounds like a fun project" when
    you read about building a home brew antenna, go for it. But if spending an afternoon
    with a soldering iron in your hand sounds like a form of cruel and unusual punishment,
    remember that an inexpensive commercial antenna will do the same job just as well,
    with a lot less effort.'
