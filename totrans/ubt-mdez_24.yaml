- en: 'As I mentioned in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Becoming a Penguinista"),
    the version of the Ubuntu Desktop CD that comes with this book is designed to
    work with i386 processors, in either PCs or Intel-based Macs. It will also work
    with AMD64 or Intel Core 2 processors, albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to
    use Ubuntu with these processors (or any other machine based on AMD64 or EM64T
    architecture) in 64-bit mode, you must get a different disc on your own. There
    are a few ways to do this: downloading an ISO (disc image) and then burning it
    to disc yourself or ordering the disc from an online Linux disc provider.'

    Ubuntu website at [http://www.ubuntu.com/](http://www.ubuntu.com/), find the link
    to the download page, and then select and download the 64-bit version. Remember
    that the ISO file you will be downloading is a heavyweight, weighing in at 700MB,
    so the download will take a bit of time. Don’t count on getting it all downloaded
    and done before dinner . . . or, if you happen to be using a dial-up Internet
    connection, before dinner tomorrow. Yikes!

    before you can use it. Although Windows has built-in disc-writing capabilities,
    not all versions have the built-in ability to burn ISOs. To burn an ISO to disc
    in Windows 7, just right-click the ISO file, select **Burn disc image**, and then
    click the **Burn** button in the window that appears. In all other versions of
    Windows, however, you must use a third-party commercial application, such as Nero.
    If you don’t have a commercial disc-burning utility installed on your system,
    try the free and handy ISO Recorder.

- en: To get ISO Recorder, visit [http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm](http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm).
    Once the download is complete, double-click the *ISORecorderSetup.msi* file on
    your hard disk to install it. After the installation is finished, burn your ISO
    to disc by right-clicking the Ubuntu ISO file on your machine and selecting **Open
    with** ▸ **ISO Recorder** in the pop-up menu. A wizard window will appear. Using
    ISO Recorder is pretty intuitive, but if you like your directions clearly laid
    out, a set is available online at [http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/HowTo.htm](http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/HowTo.htm).

- en: One thing to bear in mind when making your installation discs is that it is
    generally best to burn installation or live discs at a lower speed than the maximum
    speed allowed by your drive in order to reduce the chance of error (with 2X to
    4X speeds considered optimal). To do so, make your choice from the Recording speed
    drop-down menu. Next, pop a blank disc into the drive and click the **Next** button.
    The CD-burning process should begin. Once it’s done, the CD should pop out of
    the drive, and if all goes well, you’ll have yourself an AMD64-compatible live
    CD. You can then use it by following the directions at the beginning of [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Wading and Diving") for using the live CD that comes with this book.

    installed and run on Intel-based Macs. You can also, of course, download ISOs
    for other architectures on your Mac and then burn them to CD for use on other
    machines.

    not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disc in the area at the
    top portion of the left pane. If the disc is mounted, a drive icon will appear
    in that location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to that entry
    to eject, or *unmount*, it.

    and open the **Utilities** folder. In that folder, find and then double-click
    **Disk Utility**. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility
    window when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD
    ISO you just downloaded, and drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility window,
    just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file appears in
    that list, click it once to highlight it.

    toolbar and, when prompted to do so, insert a blank CD into your drive. Once the
    blank disc is inserted and recognized, you will be able to adjust the burn speed
    from the drop-down menu next to the word *Speed*. Select as low a speed as your
    hardware will allow, which, depending on the age of your Mac, will probably be
    4X to 8X. Finally, click the **Burn** button in that same window, and the burning
    process will begin.

    only the 32-bit version is available, which is the same version that comes with
    this book. You can, however, order a 64-bit version from an independent online
    source, such as [OSDisc.com](http://www.osdisc.com/).
