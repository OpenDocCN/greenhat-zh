</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you have already installed Fedora Core  (or even Red Hat Linux 9) on your machine,  you can skip right over this chapter and go  on to the next one. If, however, you haven’t  installed Fedora Core yet and are ready and raring  to do so, then you had better stay right where you are and  read on. In this chapter, I will guide you through the  installation steps and review everything you need to do  before that in order to get Linux up and running on  your machine.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before beginning the installation of Fedora Core, you must decide upon a root password, a user account name, and a user password. You will be asked for this  information during installation, so it will be good to get it out of the way here.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may wonder what this <i class="calibre11">root</i> business is all about, so I will explain. Generally, Linux asks that you have at least two accounts: a <i class="calibre11">root</i> account and a <i class="calibre11">user </i>account. The root account is there automatically; all you have to do is come up  with a password. The root account is used for system administration chores, such  as installing programs or changing system settings. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As for the user account, this you will set up yourself during the post- installation process at the end of this chapter. You decide on your own username  and password. The user account is the one that you use for your everyday  computing chores.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In general, if you are doing anything other than altering the system setup in  some way, you should be using your user account. This is Linux’s way of  protecting you from yourself, so that in the course of your everyday computer use  you will not damage the system by doing anything dumb. If you screw anything  up, it will only affect your personal data; the system will remain intact.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">With your root account powers, you can create additional user accounts at  any time. Let’s say that your family wants to use your computer, but you don’t  want them messing around with your files or, worse yet, blitzing the whole system  in some way. You could use one account for yourself, and then add additional  accounts for your daughter (Erika), your son (Jethro), and your spouse (Pat). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Under this system, when any one of them starts up your computer, they will  only be able to log in to their own account, from which they will have no access to  the system itself or to any of the files in anyone else’s account. Jethro cannot read  Erika’s private letters; Erika cannot find out what Jethro has bookmarked in his  Web browser, and your beloved Pat cannot pop open one of your spreadsheet  files to find out how you are squandering the family fortune — all very safe and  convenient. Of course, because you set up the computer and, thus, also have  access to the root account, you can log in as the root user and enter any of their  accounts to see what is going on. This may not be fair to them, but that is just the  way things are. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you understand the root/user distinction, decide upon a root  password and a user password. You will be using the user password every time you  log in, so make sure it is something that you won’t forget and, more importantly,  won’t mind typing in every day. The root password you won’t really need to use as  much, although you will be using it quite a bit while doing the projects in this  book. Still, it should be something that you will remember, because it is very  important. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will also need to come up with a username for yourself. It could be as  simple as your initials (my username is <i class="calibre11">rg</i>) or the name of your favorite tropical  fish, such as <i class="calibre11">neontetra</i>. Whatever you choose, it will appear on your desktop once  you’ve logged in, so make sure it is a username you don’t mind seeing every day.  Having to see “stinky’s Home” on your desktop day in and day out could prove a  little annoying if not embarrassing. By the way, your username cannot have any  spaces and must be all lowercase. <a name="46" id="46"/><a name="IDX-16" id="IDX-16"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve decided upon your username and your root and user  passwords, make sure that you write them down on a piece of paper or in a  book, and keep it at hand until the installation process is over and you have  gotten the swing of things. After that, you can store it in some safe place — but  don’t forget, as I am prone to do, where that safe place is. The information is  very important, and it is easy, as time rolls by, to forget such things, which you  definitely do not want to do. Holding on to your root password is most important  of all, because without it you won’t be able to install packages, add users, or even  change your printer settings. </p>

<a name="47" class="calibre15" id="47"/><a name="wbp04Chapter2P14" class="calibre15" id="wbp04Chapter2P14"/>Single- or Dual-Boot Setup?</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you don’t have Windows on your machine, you can skip right over this section.  If you do have Windows installed on your machine, the first thing you are going  to have to do is decide whether or not you want to keep it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It is possible to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same machine  and for them to happily coexist. In my own case, I started out with just such a  dual-boot setup. In time, however, I found that I used the Linux side of things  exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I  didn’t use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped the  whole thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup. My feeling is that unless  you have some application that you really need that is not available on the Linux  side (probably some game), then go for the Linux-only setup and just forget  about Windows. Linux has most of what you will need anyway, and because  OpenOffice can read and write MS Office files, you’ll be well enough connected,  if that is of concern to you.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may be thinking that if you do as I suggest and dump your Windows  system when you install Linux, you might have to reinstall Windows if you don’t  like Linux or if you can’t get it installed properly. That would be a considerable  waste of time and energy, to be sure. However, believe it or not, there are  advantages to my suggestion even if your no-go scenario turns out to be the case.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may have noticed that your Windows system, as you’ve used it over time,  has gotten sort of gunked up — it is no longer the quick little kitten it used to be. Menus don’t pop open as quickly as they used to, things take longer to start up  than they did before, and you find yourself saying “what the Sam Habberdack is  that!” all the time, as mysterious things happen with increasing frequency. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is just the nature of the beast, and a very good way of getting things back  to normal is to reinstall the whole thing. So even if you do decide to come back  to Windows later, you’ll be doing yourself a favor, because it should run better  than before. It’s a little more work up front, but in the long run you’ll be a  happier camper.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If, on the other hand, you opt for running both Windows and Linux, you will  be greeted by a Linux boot-selection screen when you start up your machine, from which you can choose to continue booting up Linux or choose Windows in  its stead. After that, boot-up proceeds as normal for the system you selected. This  setup works fine, so you needn’t worry.<a name="48" id="48"/><a name="IDX-17" id="IDX-17"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, in order to create a dual-boot setup, you will need to have either  two hard disks (preferable) or at least two partitions on one hard disk. The disk  or partition on which you intend to install Fedora Core (the non-Windows, or  <i class="calibre11">target,</i> partition) will also have to be at least 5 gigabytes (GB) in size. If you don’t  have a single partition of that size available but do have two or three that you can  use, that will do too. And if you don’t have any of these, you can either install  another internal hard disk or create another partition with some partitioning  software, such as Partition Magic, before trying to install Fedora Core. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The state of your target partition or disk will determine what creating a dual- boot system means for you during the installation process. If, for example, the  target partition or disk is just unformatted free space, the installation process will  be much like a straight Linux-only installation. If, however, the target hard disk  or partition is already formatted in a DOS file system, such as Fat16 or Fat32,  then you will have a bit more work cut out for you during the installation process. The dual-boot installation process is explained in the <a href="DDU0022.html#67" target="_parent">“Dual-Boot Installation”</a>  section later in the chapter — read through that section to get an idea of  whether or not you’ll feel comfortable doing what needs to be done.</p>

<a name="49" class="calibre15" id="49"/><a name="wbp04Chapter2P23" class="calibre15" id="wbp04Chapter2P23"/>Pre-Installation: Can You Boot from CD?</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before you go on to the installation, make sure that your computer is set up to  boot from your CD drive. Most machines these days are set up to do this, so you  probably don’t have to do anything special. If you’re not sure and don’t feel like  tinkering around, you can just find out by going right to the installation steps in  the <a href="DDU0021.html#53" target="_parent">next section</a>. If the installation starts up, you can just keep going. On the  other hand, if you suddenly boot up in Windows, you will have to make some  adjustments.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Probably the only thing you have to do is restart your machine and then  press whatever key the screen tells you to in order to enter your BIOS setup. This  is usually DELETE or F1, but not all machines are the same. If the onscreen  information passes by so fast that you miss it, you can check your user’s manual to  see what the correct key is. Once you get into the BIOS setup, change the boot  sequence so that your CD drive is first.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the extremely unlikely event that your machine cannot boot from a CD at  all, you will have to create a 3.5-inch boot diskette. To do this, you must first boot  up your machine in Windows. Once you are at your Windows desktop, insert the  Fedora Core Install Disk 1 and look for and open the <b class="calibre13">dosutils</b> folder on that CD. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the <b class="calibre13">dosutils</b> folder, you will find another folder called <b class="calibre13">rawritewin</b>. Open that folder, and you will find a utility program called <b class="calibre13">rawwritewin</b> (that’s no typo:  two w’s in the folder name, but three in the application name). It has a little  penguin as its icon. Double-click the penguin, and RawWrite will open up as  shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU1">Figure 2-1</a>.<a name="50" id="50"/><a name="IDX-18" id="IDX-18"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To create the boot floppy, put a 1.44MB floppy disk in your floppy drive. In the  <b class="calibre13">Image File</b> input box in the RawWrite window, type <span>D:\images/bootdisk.img</span> (if your  CD drive is not the D drive, change this accordingly) or use the <b class="calibre13">...</b> button to  locate the file graphically. Once you’ve done this, click the <b class="calibre13">Write</b> button, and  RawWrite will create a boot floppy for you. Once it’s done, be sure to label the  diskette accordingly.</p>

<a name="53" class="calibre15" id="53"/><a name="wbp04Chapter2P30" class="calibre15" id="wbp04Chapter2P30"/>Doing the Deed</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s get down to the actual Linux installation. Put Install Disk 1 in your CD drive  (and if you needed to make a boot floppy, stick that into your floppy drive too)  and keep the other installation CD and a blank floppy disk next to your  computer. Set this book on your lap so you can follow along, and get ready for  action. It’s time to do the deed!</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To keep things as simple as possible, I will ask you to let me be the captain  here. Don’t worry about what to do unless I specifically ask you to check or  decide something on your own. If any of the selections I ask you to make sound  odd, there is a reason, so don’t worry. Trust me here. I am going to have you  install your system in a way that will allow you to do all of the projects in this  book, that will keep you out of trouble, that will give you greater flexibility in the  future once you’re on your own, and that hopefully will make things run a tad  faster than they might otherwise. We will be installing the KDE desktop  environment in addition to GNOME, so you will have the chance to use KDE in  the future as well. Once you know a bit more about what you are doing, you will  be able to make changes to system settings and add or delete software packages  as you choose.<a name="54" id="54"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you look at the following steps, the installation may look like a long  and cumbersome process. It is not. It will be over more quickly than you can  imagine. Installation steps 1–23 combined take me less than five minutes to  complete. As a beginner frequently referring to this text, you might take a bit  longer, of course, but don’t worry. All in all, the whole process is faster (and I think easier) than that for Windows XP or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that with  XP and OS X, you are installing the operating system with just a few bundled  applications. In a Fedora Core Linux installation, you are installing not only the  operating system itself, but also most of the applications you will ever want or  need to use. You will thus be getting a lot done in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One more thing before we start. Some people approach installing a system  with a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as if the house  is going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing somewhere along the  line. Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as you have  backed up your data, you will be OK. If you screw up the installation the first time  out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, as you have nothing to harm.  Just make sure that you give yourself more time than you need for the process.  Don’t start installing one hour before you have to be at work, or before you have  to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes people do weird things. Make  things easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty of time . . . and by backing up any  data you would mourn the loss of.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">That said, let’s get to it!</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will now be treated to a blue screen with the words “Welcome to Fedora  Core” at the top.

After a few more seconds, you will have a total blackout, but  don’t panic, as this is all normal and will only last a few moments. Then you will  see an X in the middle of the screen, followed by a graphical Fedora Core splash  screen with a blue background. This will disappear on its own in a couple of  seconds, after which you will see the first graphical installation screen, “Welcome  to Fedora Core.”</p>

<a name="68" id="68"/><a name="IDX-25" id="IDX-25"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you’ve decided to keep Windows on your machine and install Linux on  another partition or on another internal hard disk, then you need to follow these  installation steps, as was mentioned in step 10 in the <a href="DDU0021.html#53" target="_parent">previous section</a>. If you are  doing a Linux-only install with no Windows on your machine, you can ignore this section and move on, unless, of course, you’re just interested.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned before, in order to create a dual-boot setup, you will need to  have an additional hard drive in your machine (preferred) or at least 5GB of  space (10GB would be better) on a partition that you are willing to commit to Linux (other than the one where you have Windows installed). If you do not  have a second hard drive or an additional partition, you will either have to install  another hard drive or add another partition to your present drive with a  partitioning program, such as Partition Magic, before trying to install Fedora.  You do not need to format or clear the target partition or disk before proceeding; just make sure you have one. And again, remember that any data on the  partition or disk which you are allocating to Linux will be erased for good.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The following steps will prepare your disks for dual-boot installation. This  may seem complicated, but it isn’t bad at all. Just follow the directions as laid out, and you should have no problems. You can always go back to change things once  you’re done, so don’t get too stressed out. The process is rather forgiving. </p>

Select the target partition or disk that you will  use for your Linux installation by clicking the partition name in the list or by  clicking the graphical map of your disk setup. Your Windows partition will  most likely be hda1 (for an IDE drive) or sda1 (for a SCSI drive), so your target will probably be hda2 or, in the case of a separate hard disk, sda2, hdb1,  or sdbOnce you have made your selection, click the <b class="calibre13">Delete</b> button in the  middle of the right half of the screen, which will clear all data and formatting from the partition or disk you have selected.</p>
