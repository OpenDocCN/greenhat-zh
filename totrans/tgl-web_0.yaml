    mechanism that allowed a handful of students, plus a bunch of asocial, basement-dwelling
    geeks, to visit each other’s home pages dedicated to science, pets, or poetry.
    Today, it is the platform of choice for writing complex, interactive applications
    (from mail clients to image editors to computer games) and a medium reaching hundreds
    of millions of casual users around the globe. It is also an essential tool of
    commerce, important enough to be credited for causing a recession when the 1999
    to 2001 dot-com bubble burst.'

    standards we are accustomed to in today’s information age—and its speed of ascent
    brought with it an unexpected problem. The design flaws and implementation shortcomings
    of the World Wide Web are those of a technology that never aspired to its current
    status and never had a chance to pause and look back at previous mistakes. The
    resulting issues have quickly emerged as some of the most significant and prevalent
    threats to data security today: As it turns out, the protocol design standards
    one would apply to a black-on-gray home page full of dancing hamsters are not
    necessarily the same for an online shop that processes millions of credit card
    transactions every year.'

    Nearly every single noteworthy online application devised so far has had to pay
    a price for the corners cut in the early days of the Web. Heck, *xssed.com*, a
    site dedicated to tracking a narrow subset of web-related security glitches, amassed
    some 50,000 entries in about three years of operation. Yet, browser vendors are
    largely unfazed, and the security community itself has offered little insight
    or advice on how to cope with the widespread misery. Instead, many security experts
    stick to building byzantine vulnerability taxonomies and engage in habitual but
    vague hand wringing about the supposed causes of this mess.'

    web security ruckus, unable to understand what it was all about. They have been
    quick to label web security flaws as trivial manifestations of the *confused deputy
    problem*^([[1](#ftn.PREFACE-FN-1)]) or of some other catchy label outlined in
    a trade journal three decades ago. And why should they care about web security,
    anyway? What is the impact of an obscene comment injected onto a dull pet-themed
    home page compared to the gravity of a traditional system-compromise flaw?

    the Web turned out to matter a lot more than originally expected, but we’ve failed
    to pay attention to some fundamental characteristics that put it well outside
    our comfort zone. After all, even the best-designed and most thoroughly audited
    web applications have far more issues, far more frequently, than their nonweb
    counterparts.

    Tangled Web* tries to take a small step toward much-needed normalcy, and as such,
    it may be the first publication to provide a systematic and thorough analysis
    of the current state of affairs in the world of web application security. In the
    process of doing so, it aims to shed light on the uniqueness of the security challenges
    that we—security engineers, web developers, and users—have to face every day.

    high-level browser building blocks and various security-relevant topics derived
    from this narrative. I have taken this approach because it seems to be more informative
    and intuitive than simply enumerating the issues using an arbitrarily chosen taxonomy
    (a practice seen in many other information security books). I hope, too, that
    this approach will make *The Tangled Web* a better read.

    cheat sheets at the end of many of the chapters. These cheat sheets outline sensible
    approaches to some of the most commonly encountered problems in web application
    design. In addition, the final part of the book offers a quick glossary of the
    well-known implementation vulnerabilities that one may come across.

    delighted to be working with a number of talented peers who provided excellent
    input to make the *Browser Security Handbook* more useful and accurate. In particular,
    thanks to Filipe Almeida, Drew Hintz, Marius Schilder, and Parisa Tabriz for their
    assistance.

    lot to the research on browser security done by members of the information security
    community. Special credit goes to Adam Barth, Collin Jackson, Chris Evans, Jesse
    Ruderman, Billy Rios, and Eduardo Vela Nava for the advancement of our understanding
    of this field.

- en: ^([[1](#PREFACE-FN-1)]) *Confused deputy problem* is a generic concept in information
    security used to refer to a broad class of design or implementation flaws. The
    term describes any vector that allows the attacker to trick a program into misusing
    some “authority” (access privileges) to manipulate a resource in an unintended
    manner—presumably one that is beneficial to the attacker, however that benefit
    is defined. The phrase “confused deputy” is regularly invoked by security researchers
    in academia, but since virtually all real-world security problems could be placed
    in this bucket when considered at some level of abstraction, this term is nearly
    meaningless.
