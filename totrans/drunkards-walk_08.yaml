- en: '**I**N THE MID-1960S, some ninety years old and in great need of money to live
    on, a Frenchwoman named Jeanne Calment made a deal with a forty-seven-year-old
    lawyer: she sold him her apartment for the price of a low monthly subsistence
    payment with the agreement that the payments would stop upon her death, at which
    point she would be carried out and he could move in.[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts1a)
    The lawyer must have known that Ms. Calment had already exceeded the French life
    expectancy by more than ten years. He may not have been aware of Bayes’s theory,
    however, nor known that the relevant issue was not whether she should be expected
    to die in minus ten years but that her life expectancy, given that she had already
    made it to ninety, was about six more years.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts2a)
    Still, he had to feel comfortable believing that any woman who as a teenager had
    met Vincent van Gogh in her father’s shop would soon be joining van Gogh in the
    hereafter. (For the record, she found the artist “dirty, badly dressed, and disagreeable.”)'

    expectancy was then about two years, she reached her 110th birthday still on the
    lawyer’s dime. By that point the attorney had turned sixty-seven. But it was another
    decade before the attorney’s long wait came to an end, and it wasn’t the end he
    expected. In 1995 the attorney himself died while Jeanne Calment lived on. Her
    day of reckoning finally came on August 4, 1997, at the age of 122\. Her age at

    from groups and analyzed en masse, regular patterns emerge. Suppose you have driven
    accident-free for twenty years. Then one fateful afternoon while you’re on vacation
    in Quebec with your spouse and your in-laws, your mother-in-law yells, “Look out
    for that moose!” and you swerve into a warning sign that says essentially the
    same thing. To you the incident would feel like an odd and unique event. But as
    the need for the sign indicates, in an ensemble of thousands of drivers a certain
    percentage of drivers can be counted on to encounter a moose. In fact, a statistical
    ensemble of people acting randomly often displays behavior as consistent and predictable
    as a group of people pursuing conscious goals. Or as the philosopher Immanuel
    Kant wrote in 1784, “Each, according to his own inclination follows his own purpose,
    often in opposition to others; yet each individual and people, as if following
    some guiding thread, go toward a natural but to each of them unknown goal; all
    work toward furthering it, even if they would set little store by it if they did
    know it.”[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts3a)

    200 million drivers in the United States.[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts4a)
    And according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in one recent
    year those drivers drove a total of about 2.86 trillion miles.[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts5a)
    That’s about 14,300 miles per driver. Now suppose everyone in the country had
    decided it would be fun to hit that same total again the following year. Let’s
    compare two methods that could have been used to achieve that goal. In method
    1 the government institutes a rationing system employing one of the National Science
    Foundation’s supercomputing centers to assign personal mileage targets that meet
    each of the 200 million motorists’ needs while maintaining the previous annual
    average of 14,300\. In method 2 we tell drivers not to stress out over it and
    to drive as much or as little as they please with no regard to how far they drove
    the prior year. If Uncle Billy Bob, who used to walk to work at the liquor store,
    decides instead to log 100,000 miles as a shotgun wholesaler in West Texas, that’s
    fine. And if Cousin Jane in Manhattan, who logged most of her mileage circling
    the block on street-cleaning days in search of a parking space, gets married and
    moves to New Jersey, we won’t worry about that either. Which method would come
    closer to the target of 14,300 miles per driver? Method 1 is impossible to test,
    though our limited experience with gasoline rationing indicates that it probably
    wouldn’t work very well. Method 2, on the other hand, was actually instituted—that
    is, the following year, drivers drove as much or as little as they pleased without
    attempting to hit any quota. How did they do? According to the National Highway
    Traffic Safety Administration, that year American drivers drove 2.88 trillion
    miles, or 14,400 miles per person, only 100 miles above target. What’s more, those
    200 million drivers also suffered, within less than 200, the same number of fatalities
    in both years (42,815 versus 42,643).

    drivers vary unforeseeably, in the aggregate their behavior could hardly have
    proved more orderly. Analogous regularities can be found if we examine how people
    vote, buy stocks, marry, are told to get lost, misaddress letters, or sit in traffic
    on their way to a meeting they didn’t want to go to in the first place—or if we
    measure the length of their legs, the size of their feet, the width of their buttocks,
    or the breadth of their beer bellies. As nineteenth-century scientists dug into
    newly available social data, wherever they looked, the chaos of life seemed to
    produce quantifiable and predictable patterns. But it was not just the regularities
    that astonished them. It was also the nature of the variation. Social data, they

    when William the Conqueror commissioned what was, in effect, the first national
    census. William began his rule in 1035, at age seven, when he succeeded his father
    as duke of Normandy. As his moniker implies, Duke William II liked to conquer,
    and in 1066 he invaded England. By Christmas Day he was able to give himself the
    present of being crowned king. His swift victory left him with a little problem:
    whom exactly had he conquered, and more important, how much could he tax his new
    subjects? To answer those questions, he sent inspectors into every part of England
    to note the size, ownership, and resources of each parcel of land.[⁶](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts6a)
    To make sure they got it right, he sent a second set of inspectors to duplicate
    the effort of the first set. Since taxation was based not on population but on
    land and its usage, the inspectors made a valiant effort to count every ox, cow,
    and pig but didn’t gather much data about the people who shoveled their droppings.
    Even if population data had been relevant, in medieval times a statistical survey
    regarding the most vital statistics about humans—their life spans and diseases—would
    have been considered inconsistent with the traditional Christian concept of death.
    According to that doctrine, it was wrong to make death the object of speculation
    and almost sacrilegious to look for laws governing it. For whether a person died
    from a lung infection, a stomachache, or a rock whose impact exceeded the compressive
    strength of his skull, the true cause of his or her death was considered to be
    simply God’s will. Over the centuries that fatalistic attitude gradually gave
    way, yielding to an opposing view, according to which, by studying the regularities
    of nature and society, we are not challenging God’s authority but rather learning
    about his ways.'

    plague, the city instituted a weekly tally. Theorists on the Continent turned

    notions: buttons, thread, needles, and other small items used in a household.
    But Graunt wasn’t just a button salesman; he was a wealthy button salesman, and

    people who starved to death. In 1665 that number was reported to be 45, only about
    double the number who died from execution. In contrast, 4,808 were reported to
    have died from consumption, 1,929 from “spotted fever and purples,” 2,614 from
    “teeth and worms,” and 68,596 from the plague. Why, when London was “teeming with
    beggars,” did so few starve? Graunt concluded that the populace must be feeding
    the hungry. And so he proposed instead that the state provide the food, thereby
    costing society nothing while ridding seventeenth-century London streets of their
    equivalent of panhandlers and squeegee men. Graunt also weighed in on the two
    leading theories of how the plague is spread. One theory held that the illness
    was transmitted by foul air; the other, that it was transmitted from person to
    person. Graunt looked at the week-to-week records of deaths and concluded that
    the fluctuations in the data were too great to be random, as he expected they
    would be if the person-to-person theory were correct. On the other hand, since
    weather varies erratically week by week, he considered the fluctuating data to
    be consistent with the foul-air theory. As it turned out, London was not ready
    for soup kitchens, and Londoners would have fared better if they had avoided ugly
    rats rather than foul air, but Graunt’s great discoveries lay not in his conclusions.
    They lay instead in his realization that statistics can provide insights into
    the system from which the statistics are derived.

    Believing that the strength of the state depends on, and is reflected by, the
    number and character of its subjects, Petty employed statistical reasoning to
    analyze national issues. Typically his analyses were made from the point of view
    of the sovereign and treated members of society as objects to be manipulated at
    will. Regarding the plague, he pointed out that money should be spent on prevention
    because, in saving lives, the realm would preserve part of the considerable investment
    society made in raising men and women to maturity and therefore would reap a higher
    return than it would on the most lucrative of alternative investments. Regarding
    the Irish, Petty was not as charitable. He concluded, for example, that the economic
    value of an English life was greater than that of an Irish one, so the wealth
    of the kingdom would be increased if all Irishmen except a few cowherds were forcibly
    relocated to England. As it happened, Petty owed his own wealth to those same
    Irish: as a doctor with the invading British army in the 1650s, he had been given
    the task of assessing the spoils and assessed that he could get away with grabbing
    a good share for himself, which he did.[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts9a)'

    of its government, then the lack of a good method for measuring the size of a
    population made the assessment of its government difficult. Graunt’s most famous
    calculations addressed that issue—in particular the population of London. From
    the bills of mortality, Graunt knew the number of births. Since he had a rough
    idea of the fertility rate, he could infer how many women were of childbearing
    age. That datum allowed him to guess the total number of families and, using his
    own observations of the mean size of a London family, thereby estimate the city’s
    population. He came up with 384,000—previously it was believed to be 2 million.
    Graunt also raised eyebrows by showing that much of the growth of the city was
    due to immigration from outlying areas, not to the slower method of procreation,
    and that despite the horrors of the plague, the decrease in population due to
    even the worst epidemic was always made up within two years. In addition, Graunt
    is generally credited with publishing the first “life table,” a systematic arrangement
    of life-expectancy data that today is widely employed by organizations—from life
    insurance companies to the World Health Organization—that are interested in knowing
    how long people live. A life table displays how many people, in a group of 100,
    can be expected to survive to any given age. To Graunt’s data (the column in the
    table below labeled “London, 1662”), I’ve added columns exhibiting the same data

    In that data, when the number of conscripts was plotted against their height,
    the bell-shaped curve was distorted: too few prospects were just above five feet
    two and a compensating surplus was just below that height. Quételet argued that

    his loaves that they averaged about 950 grams instead of the 1,000 grams advertised.
    He complained to the authorities and afterward received bigger loaves. Still he
    had a hunch that something about his bread wasn’t kosher. And so with the patience
    only a famous—or at least tenured—scholar can afford, he carefully weighed his
    bread every day for the next year. Though his bread now averaged closer to 1,000
    grams, if the baker had been honestly handing him random loaves, the number of
    loaves heavier and lighter than the mean should have—as I mentioned in chapter
    7—diminished following the bell-shaped pattern of the error law. Instead, Poincaré
    found that there were too few light loaves and a surplus of heavy ones. He concluded
    that the baker had not ceased baking underweight loaves but instead was seeking
    to placate him by always giving him the largest loaf he had on hand. The police
    again visited the cheating baker, who was reportedly appropriately astonished

    mass of bettors because the bookies adjust them to balance the demand. (Bookies
    make their money on fees and seek to have an equal amount of money bet on each
    side so that they can’t lose, whatever the outcome.) To measure how well bettors
    assess two teams, economists use a number called the forecast error, which is
    the difference between the favored team’s margin of victory and the point spread
    determined by the marketplace. It may come as no surprise that forecast error,
    being a type of error, is distributed according to the normal distribution. Wolfers
    found that its mean is 0, meaning that the point spreads don’t tend to either
    overrate or underrate teams, and its standard deviation is 10.9 points, meaning
    that about two thirds of the time the point spread is within 10.9 points of the
    margin of victory. (In a study of professional football games, a similar result
    was found, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 13.9 points.)[^(19)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts19a)

    found something astonishing: there were too few games in which the heavy favorite
    won by a little more than the point spread and an inexplicable surplus of games
    in which the favorite won by just less. This was again Quételet’s anomaly. Wolfers’s
    conclusion, like Quételet’s and Poincaré’s, was fraud. His analysis went like
    this: it is hard for even a top player to ensure that his team will beat a point
    spread, but if the team is a heavy favorite, a player, without endangering his
    team’s chance of victory, can slack off enough to ensure that the team does *not*
    beat the spread. And so if unscrupulous bettors wanted to fix games without asking
    players to risk losing, the result would be just the distortions Wolfers found.
    Does Wolfers’s work prove that in some percentage of college basketball games,
    players are taking bribes to shave points? No, but as Wolfers says, “You shouldn’t

    people and society. If you made 1,000 copies of a statue, he wrote, those copies
    would vary due to errors of measurement and workmanship, and that variation would
    be governed by the error law. If the variation in people’s physical traits follows
    the same law, he reasoned, it must be because we, too, are imperfect replicas
    of a prototype. Quételet called that prototype *l’homme moyen,* the average man.
    He felt that a template existed for human behavior too. The manager of a large
    department store may not know whether the spacey new cashier will pocket that
    half-ounce bottle of Chanel Allure she was sniffing, but he can count on the prediction

    of those changes and their causes that was Quételet’s greatest ambition. “Man
    is born, grows up, and dies according to certain laws,” he wrote, and those laws
    “have never been studied.”[^(23)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts23a)
    Newton became the father of modern physics by recognizing and formulating a set
    of universal laws. Modeling himself after Newton, Quételet desired to create a
    new “social physics” describing the laws of human behavior. In Quételet’s analogy,
    just as an object, if undisturbed, continues in its state of motion, so the mass
    behavior of people, if social conditions remain unchanged, remains constant. And
    just as Newton described how physical forces deflect an object from its straight
    path, so Quételet sought laws of human behavior describing how social forces transform
    the characteristics of society. For example, Quételet thought that vast inequalities
    of wealth and great fluctuations in prices were responsible for crime and social
    unrest and that a steady level of crime represented a state of equilibrium, which
    would change with changes in the underlying causes. A vivid example of such a
    change in social equilibrium occurred in the months after the attacks of September
    11, 2001, when travelers, afraid to take airplanes, suddenly switched to cars.
    Their fear translated into about 1,000 more highway fatalities in that period

    like astronomy than physics, with insights deduced from passive observation. And

    population in any given range of heights must be nearly uniform over time and
    that the normal distribution governs height and every other physical feature:
    circumference of the head, size of the brain, weight of the gray matter, number
    of brain fibers, and so on. But Galton didn’t stop there. He believed that human
    character, too, is determined by heredity and, like people’s physical features,
    obeys in some manner the normal distribution. And so, according to Galton, men
    are not “of equal value, as social units, equally capable of voting, and the rest.”[^(29)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts29a)

    ability in some area and as a result become eminent in their field. (As, in his
    day, women did not generally work, he did not make a similar analysis of them.)
    Galton founded a new field of study based on those ideas, calling it eugenics,
    from the Greek words *eu* (good) and *genos* (birth). Over the years, eugenics
    has meant many different things to many different people. The term and some of
    his ideas were adopted by the Nazis, but there is no evidence that Galton would
    have approved of the Germans’ murderous schemes. His hope, rather, was to find
    a way to improve the condition of humankind through selective breeding.'

    a task of any complexity, the connection between ability and accomplishment is
    far less direct than anything that can possibly be explained by Galton’s ideas.
    In fact, in recent years psychologists have found that the ability to persist

    least a decade of hard work, practice, and striving to become highly successful
    in most endeavors. It might seem daunting to think that effort and chance, as
    much as innate talent, are what counts. But I find it encouraging because, while
    our genetic makeup is out of our control, our degree of effort is up to us. And

    him to discover two mathematical concepts that are central to modern statistics.
    One came to him in 1875, after he distributed packets of sweet pea pods to seven
    friends. Each friend received seeds of uniform size and weight and returned to
    Galton the seeds of the successive generations. On measuring them, Galton noticed
    that the median diameter of the offspring of large seeds was less than that of
    the parents, whereas the median diameter of the offspring of small seeds was greater
    than that of the parents. Later, employing data he obtained from a laboratory
    he had set up in London, he noticed the same effect in the height of human parents
    and children. He dubbed the phenomenon—that in linked measurements, if one measured
    quantity is far from its mean, the other will be closer to its mean—regression
    toward the mean.

    mean would eventually go out of control. For example, suppose the sons of tall
    fathers would on average be as tall as their fathers. Since heights vary, some
    sons would be taller. Now imagine the next generation, and suppose the sons of
    the taller sons, grandsons of the original men, were also on average as tall as
    their fathers. Some of them, too, would have to be taller than their fathers.
    In this way, as generation followed generation, the tallest humans would be ever
    taller. Because of regression toward the mean, that does not happen. The same
    can be said of innate intelligence, artistic talent, or the ability to hit a golf
    ball. And so very tall parents should not expect their children to be as tall,
    very brilliant parents should not expect their children to be as brilliant, and
    the Picassos and Tiger Woodses of this world should not expect their children
    to match their accomplishments. On the other hand, very short parents can expect
    taller offspring, and those of us who are not brilliant or can’t paint have reasonable
    hope that our deficiencies will be improved upon in the next generation.

    heights versus the heights of their offspring. If, say, those heights were always
    equal, the graph would be a neat line rising at 45 degrees. If that relationship
    held on average but individual data points varied, then the data would show some

    it inspired much of the statistical work done in the decades that followed, in
    which the field of statistics grew rapidly and matured. One of the most important
    of these advances was made by Karl Pearson, a disciple of Galton’s. Earlier in
    this chapter, I mentioned many types of data that are distributed according to
    the normal distribution. But with a finite set of data the fit is never perfect.
    In the early days of statistics, scientists sometimes determined whether data
    were normally distributed simply by graphing them and observing the shape of the
    resulting curve. But how do you quantify the accuracy of the fit? Pearson invented
    a method, called the chi-square test, by which you can determine whether a set
    of data actually conforms to the distribution you believe it conforms to. He demonstrated
    his test in Monte Carlo in July 1892, performing a kind of rigorous repeat of
    Jagger’s work.[^(31)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts31a) In Pearson’s
    test, as in Jagger’s, the numbers that came up on a roulette wheel did not follow
    the distribution they would have followed if the wheel had produced random results.
    In another test, Pearson examined how many 5s and 6s came up in 26,306 tosses
    of twelve dice. He found that the distribution was not one you’d see in a chance
    experiment with fair dice—that is, in an experiment in which the probability of
    a 5 or a 6 on one roll were 1 in 3, or 0.3333\. But it was consistent if the probability
    of a 5 or a 6 were 0.3377—that is, if the dice were skewed. In the case of the
    roulette wheel the game may have been rigged, but the dice were probably biased
    owing to variations in manufacturing, which my friend Moshe emphasized are always
    present.

    to vote for each box. As we’ve seen, the actual results will rarely be distributed
    so evenly. Employing the chi-square test, you can determine how likely it is that
    the winning box received more votes due to consumer preference rather than to
    chance. Similarly, suppose researchers at a pharmaceutical company perform an
    experiment in which they test two treatments used in preventing acute transplant
    rejection. They can use a chi-square test to determine whether there is a statistically

    to discover through his observations the source of the life force, a mysterious
    influence believed in his day to endow something with the property of being alive.

    energy. This was not intentioned movement; it seemed, in fact, to be completely

    Then, in a deathblow to his wishful interpretation of the discovery, Brown also
    observed the motion when looking at inorganic particles—of asbestos, copper, bismuth,
    antimony, and manganese. He knew then that the movement he was observing was unrelated
    to the issue of life. The true cause of Brownian motion would prove to be the
    same force that compelled the regularities in human behavior that Quételet had

    that followed Brown’s work, by Boltzmann, Maxwell, and others. Inspired by Quételet,
    they created the new field of statistical physics, employing the mathematical
    edifice of probability and statistics to explain how the properties of fluids
    arise from the movement of the (then hypothetical) atoms that make them up. Their
    ideas did not catch on for several more decades, however. Some scientists had
    mathematical issues with the theory. Others objected because at the time no one
    had ever seen an atom and no one believed anyone ever would. But most physicists
    are practical, and so the most important roadblock to acceptance was that although
    the theory reproduced some laws that were known, it made few new predictions.
    And so matters stood until 1905, when long after Maxwell was dead and shortly
    before a despondent Boltzmann would commit suicide, Einstein employed the nascent
    theory to explain in great numerical detail the precise mechanism of Brownian
    motion.[^(34)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts34a) The necessity of
    a statistical approach to physics would never again be in doubt, and the idea
    that matter is made of atoms and molecules would prove to be the basis of most
    modern technology and one of the most important ideas in the history of physics.

- en: 'The random motion of molecules in a fluid can be viewed, as we’ll note in chapter
    10, as a metaphor for our own paths through life, and so it is worthwhile to take
    a little time to give Einstein’s work a closer look. According to the atomic picture,
    the fundamental motion of water molecules is chaotic. The molecules fly first
    this way, then that, moving in a straight line only until deflected by an encounter
    with one of their sisters. As mentioned in the Prologue, this type of path—in
    which at various points the direction changes randomly—is often called a drunkard’s
    walk, for reasons obvious to anyone who has ever enjoyed a few too many martinis
    (more sober mathematicians and scientists sometimes call it a random walk). If
    particles that float in a liquid are, as atomic theory predicts, constantly and
    randomly bombarded by the molecules of the liquid, one might expect them to jiggle
    this way and that owing to the collisions. But there are two problems with that
    picture of Brownian motion: first, the molecules are far too light to budge the
    visible floating particles; second, molecular collisions occur far more frequently
    than the observed jiggles. Part of Einstein’s genius was to realize that those
    two problems cancel each other out: though the collisions occur very frequently,
    because the molecules are so light, those frequent isolated collisions have no
    visible effect. It is only when pure luck occasionally leads to a lopsided preponderance
    of hits from some particular direction—the molecular analogue of Roger Maris’s
    record year in baseball—that a noticeable jiggle occurs. When Einstein did the
    math, he found that despite the chaos on the microscopic level, there was a predictable
    relationship between factors such as the size, number, and speed of the molecules
    and the observable frequency and magnitude of the jiggling. Einstein had, for
    the first time, connected new and measurable consequences to statistical physics.
    That might sound like a largely technical achievement, but on the contrary, it
    represented the triumph of a great principle: that much of the order we perceive
    in nature belies an invisible underlying disorder and hence can be understood
    only through the rules of randomness. As Einstein wrote, “It is a magnificent
    feeling to recognize the unity of a complex of phenomena which appear to be things
    quite apart from the direct visible truth.”[^(35)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c08-nts35a)'

  zh: 流体中分子的随机运动，正如我们在第10章中将会提到的，可以被视为我们人生道路的隐喻，因此花点时间仔细审视爱因斯坦的工作是值得的。根据原子模型，水分子的基本运动是混沌的。分子先这样飞，然后那样飞，只有在遇到其中一个姐妹分子时才会直线运动。正如序言中提到的，这种路径——在各个点方向随机改变——通常被称为醉汉的漫步，对任何曾经喝过几杯马丁尼的人来说原因显而易见（更为清醒的数学家和科学家有时称之为随机漫步）。如果漂浮在液体中的粒子，如原子理论所预测的，不断地随机受到液体分子的撞击，人们可能会预期它们会因为碰撞而这样或那样地晃动。但关于布朗运动的这种图景有两个问题：首先，分子太轻，无法推动可见的漂浮粒子；其次，分子碰撞的频率远高于观察到的晃动。爱因斯坦的才华之一在于意识到这两个问题相互抵消：尽管碰撞非常频繁，但由于分子非常轻，这些频繁的孤立碰撞没有明显的效果。只有当纯粹的运气偶尔导致来自某个特定方向的撞击明显偏多——这是分子对罗杰·马里斯在棒球中创纪录年份的类比——才会出现明显的晃动。当爱因斯坦进行数学计算时，他发现尽管在微观层面上存在混沌，但分子的大小、数量和速度等因素与可观察到的晃动频率和幅度之间存在可预测的关系。爱因斯坦首次将新的可测量后果与统计物理学联系起来。这听起来可能像是一项技术上的成就，但相反，它代表了伟大原则的胜利：我们感知到的大多数自然秩序都隐藏着看不见的潜在无序，因此只能通过随机性的规则来理解。正如爱因斯坦所写，“认识到看似完全不同现象的统一性是一种美妙的感觉。”

- en: In Einstein’s mathematical analysis the normal distribution again played a central
    role, reaching a new place of glory in the history of science. The drunkard’s
    walk, too, became established as one of the most fundamental—and soon one of the
    most studied—processes in nature. For as scientists in all fields began to accept
    the statistical approach as legitimate, they recognized the thumbprints of the
    drunkard’s walk in virtually all areas of study—in the foraging of mosquitoes
    through cleared African jungle, in the chemistry of nylon, in the formation of
    plastics, in the motion of free quantum particles, in the movement of stock prices,
    even in the evolution of intelligence over eons of time. We’ll examine the effects
    of randomness on our own paths through life in chapter 10\. But as we’re about
    to see, though in random variation there are orderly patterns, patterns are not
    always meaningful. And as important as it is to recognize the meaning when it
    is there, it is equally important not to extract meaning when it is not there.
    Avoiding the illusion of meaning in random patterns is a difficult task. It is
    the subject of the following chapter.

  zh: 在爱因斯坦的数学分析中，正态分布再次扮演了核心角色，在科学史上达到了一个新的辉煌位置。醉汉的漫步也确立为自然界中最基本——很快也成为研究最多的——过程之一。随着所有领域的科学家开始接受统计方法作为合法的方法，他们认识到醉汉的漫步的指纹几乎存在于所有研究领域——在清除的非洲丛林中蚊子的觅食，尼龙的化学性质，塑料的形成，自由量子粒子的运动，股价的变动，甚至在数亿年时间的智能进化中。我们将在第10章中考察随机性对我们人生道路的影响。但正如我们即将看到的，尽管在随机变化中有有序的模式，但模式并不总是有意义的。当存在意义时，认识到意义固然重要，但同样重要的是，当不存在意义时不要强行提取意义。避免在随机模式中产生意义的错觉是一项艰巨的任务。这是下一章的主题。
