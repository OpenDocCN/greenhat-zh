- en: The Web has changed our lives in many ways. The first online, on-demand driving
    directions from MapQuest very nearly rendered traditional road atlases obsolete.
    Today, many websites that provide driving directions also make their maps available
    to developers. Using these mapping APIs, you can plot your own points or make
    a mashup with geo-data from other websites.

- en: This book shows you how to take advantage of these services and include their
    maps on your site. Instead of limiting you to one provider, I'll show you how
    to use all of them via an open source library called *Mapstraction*. Write your
    code once and watch it work in Google Maps, Bing, MapQuest, Yahoo!, OpenStreetMap,
    and more.

- en: In addition to teaching you how to work with maps from these providers, I'll
    show you many other common geographic projects. You'll learn how to calculate
    the distance between locations and embed driving directions on your own site.
    You'll also learn how to customize the way your map looks by adding your own icons,
    adding large graphic overlays, or even completely changing the underlying map
    imagery.

- en: Bringing location to the Web by embedding maps is an important part of most
    sites now, but there's also an increasing need to bring the Web "on location"
    to smartphones running mobile browsers. You can add maps to mobile versions of
    your site using the techniques shown in this book. And I'll show you how to use
    a convenient geolocation standard to find your user's location, whether he's using
    a phone, a tablet, or even a regular computer.

    is designed to help you quickly get to work on an application you already have
    in mind or inspire your next map. To that end, I've organized the book into projects.
    And once you become a map scripting wizard, I hope this book will be useful enough
    as a reference to earn a spot on your bookshelf.

- en: The book's project-based approach starts off with basic examples then picks
    up speed quickly. If you're one to jump ahead, I'd recommend you at least read
    [Create a Mapstraction Map](ch01s03.html#create_a_mapstraction_map "Create a Mapstraction
    Map") in [Create a Mapstraction Map](ch01s03.html#create_a_mapstraction_map "Create
    a Mapstraction Map") first. Almost every example in the book builds upon the map
    you will create in that section.

    of constructing online maps. I'll introduce Mapstraction and show how to add controls,
    such as a zoom interface, to your maps.

    start adding your own points to the map. You'll create custom icons and add message
    boxes to describe locations.

    addresses and city names to coordinates that mapping providers can understand.
    This process, called *geocoding*, is a big part of making mapping human-friendly.

    to your map. You'll learn how to draw lines to describe routes and shapes to outline
    borders. You'll even see how to take large graphics, geo-reference them, and then
    add them as a map overlay.

    respond to events, such as drags, clicks, and zooms. These hooks allow you to
    create an even more interactive experience for your users.

    You'll learn how to create driving directions or search around a point. You'll
    also dive into some more advanced topics, such as determining whether a location
    is within a shape (known as a *hit test*).

    ways to access your user's location with various degrees of accuracy. I'll cover
    using the geolocation standard, falling back on IP address data, and integrating
    with location sharing services.

    data formats used on the Web. You'll learn to parse GeoRSS, Google Earth's KML,
    and XML output from most GPS devices.

    side. You'll get a crash course in PHP and MySQL, two technologies provided by
    many web hosts. We'll then use these languages for common location tasks, such
    as finding the closest points from your own database.

    with five fun mashups. You'll create a Twitter tweet finder, an interactive weather
    map, and a way to find a coffee shop between two locations (so you can meet a
    friend in the middle). There's also a local concert finder and a way to visualize
    earthquakes around the world.

- en: This book introduces cartography to web developers, and shows cartographers
    and other geo-folks how to move their maps online. It is written for beginning
    and advanced programmers alike—your skill level and knowledge of mapping will
    impact how you use the book. [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. MAPPING BASICS")
    is a good place for everyone to start, because most of the later examples build
    upon the basic maps presented there.

    read [Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. JAVASCRIPT QUICK START"). This will give
    you a primer on the concepts used throughout the book and provide a quick introduction
    to the JavaScript framework jQuery.

    end as you expand your mapping knowledge. This book also works well as a reference—you
    can skip around to find the concepts you want to learn, or find the chapter or
    project you need for your current application.

    REFERENCE"), a reference that details the classes and functions within Mapstraction.
    This reference serves as a quick way to check syntax and gives examples of how
    to use each function.
