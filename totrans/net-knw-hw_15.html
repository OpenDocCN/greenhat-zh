With the right kind of input and output devices, you can use the same network that shares computer resources to monitor and control industrial processes, listen to sound from a microphone or watch images from a camera, distribute audio and video through your home or business, and operate equipment by remote control. And if the network is connected to the Internet, you can do all those things to or from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p><p>Many of these network applications are extremely specialized (such as monitoring the temperature of the water in a stream), but others are often practical for a home or small business network. For example, you can use your network to watch or listen to activity in another room or to distribute audio and video files from an entertainment server to speakers and video displays in several locations around your home. This chapter explains how to connect and use additional devices with your network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1836"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1837"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1838"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="using_a_microphone_and_camera_with_your"/>Using a Microphone and Camera with Your Network</h1></div></div></div><p>A microphone connected to a computer or audio server can capture sounds and convert them into digital audio files. A camera (known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>webcam</em></span>) can capture images that a computer or server can convert to still or moving image files. An audio or video server can be either a computer with an internal or external microphone or a camera (or both) or a stand-alone device that connects directly to the network. When another computer receives the same audio and/or video files through a network, it can display the images on a display monitor and play the sounds through one or more speakers or through a pair of headphones.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1839"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1840"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1841"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1842"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1843"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1844"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1845"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1846"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1847"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1848"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1849"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1850"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1851"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1852"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1853"/></p><p>One widely used remote webcam service is the familiar online traffic monitor, like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#a_traffic_webcam_uses_a_networked_camer" title="Figure 15-1. A traffic webcam uses a networked camera.

The controller scans the light-sensitive portion of the camera from side to side and from top to bottom at a constant rate; when it reaches the end of one row, the controller automatically moves on to the next row; when it reaches the end of the bottom row, the controller returns to the top.</p><p>At some point in the signal chain, the analog image from the camera's lens converts to a continuous digital data stream; in most cases, this occurs inside the camera itself, but some equipment might perform the analog-to-digital conversion in the controller card. As an alternative, a camera captures still images one at a time and stores them or transmits them through the network as a series of image files.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Many camera controller cards include two or more camera inputs.

A typical network webcam includes a remote control program on a web page that a user can operate through the network, or, with the correct set of passwords and authorization, through the Internet. Depending on each camera unit's specific features, the remote control might allow an operator to zoom the image in and out, rotate or tilt the camera, or choose a different image through the same control unit. Some network webcams also include a wireless network interface that can connect to the network through a Wi-Fi base station.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1857"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1858"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1859"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="networked_cameras_and_microphones"/>Networked Cameras and Microphones</h2></div></div></div><p>Attaching a camera to your network—with or without a microphone at the same location—can add many useful features and functions.

Over-the-air, cable, or satellite TV and radio, music from a CD player or stored on a hard drive, and videos from DVDs can all provide source material for a system that can play music or display video in any room with a network connection.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1877"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1878"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1879"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1880"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1881"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1882"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1883"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1884"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1885"/></p><p>There's a whole industry out there that supports very expensive home entertainment systems, complete with video-screening rooms (the high-tech popcorn maker is optional at extra cost), TV screens built into walls or rising out of hidden cabinets in the kitchen or bedroom, multiple speakers in every room, and preprogrammed mood lighting. But unless you have a spare $10,000 or $20,000 (or more—a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> more) to spend on fancy equipment and custom installation, those systems are not particularly practical. Most of us will have to settle (!) for something considerably less extravagant. If you've already wired your house or apartment for a data network, you can add an entertainment server and connect stereos or TVs in several rooms without spending a small fortune. You can also connect entertainment devices to your network in stages, rather than spend a lot of money at one time.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1886"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1887"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1888"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1889"/></p><p>A tremendous variety of equipment and services is available that can fit within the home entertainment systems category, but for this book's purposes, I'll consider the processes of distributing music, video, and games through a home network and playing them on TVs, stereo systems, surround sound systems, and table "radios."<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1890"/></p></div>

Some of these formats use <span class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span> audio that squeezes the data into smaller files. Others use larger <span class="emphasis"><em>uncompressed</em></span> files that maintain all the original details. The most common format for compressed audio files is MP3. The most widely used formats for uncompressed files include WAV and AIFF. <a class="xref" href="ch15s03.html#common_audio_file_formats" title="Table 15-1. Common Audio File Formats">Table 15-1</a> lists the formats that you're most likely to see.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1940"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1941"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1942"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1943"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1944"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1945"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1946"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1947"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1948"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1949"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1950"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1951"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1952"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1953"/></p><p>The choice of format is a trade-off between the size of the file and the quality of the sound. As a rule of thumb, sound quality increases with file size, as measured in bits per second. A WAV file of a music track might require eight to ten times as much storage space as an MP3 file of the same recording, but the WAV file is almost always a more accurate copy of the original. The compressed MP3 file occupies less space on a hard drive and can travel across the network more quickly, but the added bits in the WAV file will mean that the music has less distortion and better frequency response (the range between the lowest bass notes and the highest treble tones). In other words, an MP3 file might sound like the recording played through an AM radio, whereas the same music played from a WAV file could sound at least as good as a very good CD player.</p><div class="table"><a id="common_audio_file_formats"/><p class="title"><b>Table 15-1. Common Audio File Formats</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " summary="Common Audio File Formats"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom"><p>File Extension</p></th><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom"><p>Format Name</p></th><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>.wav</em></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>WAV or Wave (Waveform Audio)</p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>This is Microsoft's format for uncompressed audio, which has since been adopted by others.

The compromise between file size and sound quality is particularly important when you are loading files on an iPod or other portable device with a limited amount of storage space. For a home system, where you have little or no practical limit to the amount of storage space (you can almost always add another hard drive to the server), storing your music files in an uncompressed format, especially if you plan to listen through a good quality stereo or surround sound system, is best.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1957"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It's important to store archival copies of original recordings as uncompressed files, so future users will have the best possible recordings to work with.

The client can be a program running on one or more of the household computers, a stereo component, a surround sound or home theater system, or a tabletop "boom box" or Internet radio. The client receives music files from a server or streaming audio program through the Internet and plays them through a set of headphones or speakers.</p><p>The quality of sound played through a network depends on several factors: the quality of the original recording, the amount of network traffic, and the quality of the client's digital-to-analog converter and speakers. For example, if you're playing a music track that originated on a noisy cassette tape through the tiny and tinny speakers in your laptop computer, the music will sound much worse than a track ripped from a CD and played through a good stereo amplifier and high-fidelity speakers. And if the network that connects the server to the client is already running close to its capacity, or if it's using a noisy Wi-Fi link, you might hear repeated drop-outs in the music when the client can't convert data packets to a continuous audio stream.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="playing_music_through_a_computer"/>Playing Music Through a Computer</h3></div></div></div><p>A computer used as a music client must have an internal or external audio interface, such as a sound card, an interface on the computer's motherboard, or an interface connected to the computer through a USB or FireWire port. To play a music file, open the file in an audio player program that supports the file's format, just as you would open any other kind of file. The audio output for the computer's audio interface should connect through an audio cable to a set of powered computer speakers or a full-scale stereo or home theater system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1981"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1982"/></p><p>If you're using the computer exclusively as a music client, you don't need the latest and most powerful processor or a large-screen monitor. Anything that can connect to the network and support a decent audio interface unit should be entirely adequate. If you have an older laptop that you're no longer using for other purposes, try using it as a music client; the laptop is probably more compact than a desktop unit and it might work just as well if you plug a decent audio interface into the USB port.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-1983"/></p><p>Most computers look like, well . . . like computers. If your stereo system is located on a bookshelf or behind glass cabinet doors in your living room, you might prefer to use a music server that matches your other stereo components.

But remember that you'll still need some kind of keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

However, video files contain many more bits per minute of content than audio files, so the network must have a high enough capacity to handle that additional demand. In practice, this means that many Wi-Fi links (except the newest 802.11n equipment) may not be able to keep up with a video stream, and even a wired 100-BaseT network might overload if you try to push through more than one video stream at the same time.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2030"/></p><p>When you want to download a movie or some other large video file through the Internet, it's often better to save the file to your computer's hard drive, rather than trying to view it as the computer receives it because the download speed is often too slow for the video player program to assemble the digital packets and display them as a continuous stream. On the other hand, when all the bits are already on a DVD or hard drive, the video player can play the stream without the need to wait for more bits to arrive.</p><p>You can think of the stream of incoming bits as a garden hose that fills a watering pail with a slow trickle of water; if you pour out water more quickly than the hose fills the pail, you must refill the pail before you can pour more water. The same thing applies to video files through a network: If the data packets that contain the video stream enter your network more slowly than the video player assembles and displays them, the player's buffer will run out of bits and stop displaying anything until it receives more.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="video_servers"/>Video Servers</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>video server</em></span> is a network server that stores movies and other video files and sends them through the network to video player programs on client computers or video players.

But they use different methods to accomplish the same objective, and these methods create problems when you try to move from one to the other. The difficulty arises because of the way computer monitors and TV screens break an image into scan lines and pixels. For the purpose of this explanation, we can think about a still picture, but the same problems can also occur in a moving image.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2083"/></p><p>In North America, an analog TV shows images as a sequence of 535 scan lines from left to right across the face of the screen; when the TV reaches the end of one scan line, it moves down to the next one. In digital TV, the screen is divided into a large number of dots called <span class="emphasis"><em>picture elements</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span>. The method used by the TV to light up segments of scan lines or pixels is different on picture tubes and flat panels, but the number of scan lines or pixels is specified by industry standards. The size of the screen doesn't matter; the number of scan lines or pixels on a screen is always the same (there are several different standards for flat panels, depending on size and cost, but the number of pixels is constant for each standard).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2084"/></p><p>Computer monitors also use pixels, but the number of pixels in an image is different, depending on screen resolution. When you change your monitor's resolution from, say, 800 × 600 pixels to 1280 × 1024 pixels, the computer adjusts the number of pixels within a 1-inch (2.5 cm) square space on the screen or any other image area.</p><p>To show a computer image on a TV screen, the controller must adjust the number of scan lines or pixels to fit the area available on the monitor. If the TV screen expects more scan lines or pixels than the incoming signal, the controller will duplicate occasional lines or pixels or it will create a new line that is a blend of the one above and the one below. If the computer sends too many scan lines or pixels, the screen will skip some of them. This process is called <span class="emphasis"><em>video scaling</em></span>.</p><p>Video scaling has two effects: It forces the video controller to work hard to change the size (and sometimes the shape) of the image, which can slow down performance, and it sends an image to the TV screen that can suffer from smeared colors, looser focus, jagged edges, and distorted pictures. A good controller can make adjustments that minimize these problems, but don't be surprised if the image your computer displays on a TV screen (even a very good high-definition TV screen) is not as sharp as the same image on a computer monitor; a good DVI-to-HDMI image on an HDTV can be sharper than a VGA display when everything works together correctly, but a mismatched system can be considerably less impressive.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2085"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-2086"/></p></div></div></div>
