- en: Hacking tends to be a misunderstood topic, and the media likes to sensationalize,
    which only exacerbates this condition. Changes in terminology have been mostly
    ineffective—what's needed is a change in mind-set. Hackers are just people with
    innovative spirits and an in-depth knowledge of technology. Hackers aren't necessarily
    criminals, though as long as crime has the potential to pay, there will always
    be some criminals who are hackers. There's nothing wrong with the hacker knowledge
    itself, despite its potential applications.

- en: Like it or not, vulnerabilities exist in the software and networks that the
    world depends on from day to day. It's simply an inevitable result of the fast
    pace of software development. New software is often successful at first, even
    if there are vulnerabilities. This success means money, which attracts criminals
    who learn how to exploit these vulnerabilities for financial gain. This seems
    like it would be an endless downward spiral, but fortunately, all the people finding
    the vulnerabilities in software are not just profit-driven, malicious criminals.
    These people are hackers, each with his or her own motives; some are driven by
    curiosity, others are paid for their work, still others just like the challenge,
    and several are, in fact, criminals. The majority of these people don't have malicious
    intent; instead, they help vendors fix their vulnerable software. Without hackers,
    the vulnerabilities and holes in software would remain undiscovered. Unfortunately,
    the legal system is slow and mostly ignorant with regard to technology. Often,
    draconian laws are passed and excessive sentences are given to try to scare people
    away from looking closely. This is childish logic—discouraging hackers from exploring
    and looking for vulnerabilities doesn't solve anything. Convincing everyone the
    emperor is wearing fancy new clothes doesn't change the reality that he's naked.
    Undiscovered vulnerabilities just lie in wait for someone much more malicious
    than an average hacker to discover them. The danger of software vulnerabilities
    is that the payload could be anything. Replicating Internet worms are relatively
    benign when compared to the nightmare terrorism scenarios these laws are so afraid
    of. Restricting hackers with laws can make the worst-case scenarios more likely,
    since it leaves more undiscovered vulnerabilities to be exploited by those who
    aren't bound by the law and want to do real damage.

- en: Some could argue that if there weren't hackers, there would be no reason to
    fix these undiscovered vulnerabilities. That is one perspective, but personally
    I prefer progress over stagnation. Hackers play a very important role in the co-evolution
    of technology. Without hackers, there would be little reason for computer security
    to improve. Besides, as long as the questions "Why?" and "What if?" are asked,
    hackers will always exist. A world without hackers would be a world without curiosity
    and innovation.

- en: Hopefully, this book has explained some basic techniques of hacking and perhaps
    even the spirit of it. Technology is always changing and expanding, so there will
    always be new hacks. There will always be new vulnerabilities in software, ambiguities
    in protocol specifications, and a myriad of other oversights. The knowledge gained
    from this book is just a starting point. It's up to you to expand upon it by continually
    figuring out how things work, wondering about the possibilities, and thinking
    of the things that the developers didn't think of. It's up to you to make the
    best of these discoveries and apply this knowledge however you see fit. Information
    itself isn't a crime.
