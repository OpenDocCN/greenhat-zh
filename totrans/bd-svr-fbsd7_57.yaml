- en: Procmail is a mail filter, or Mail Delivery Agent (MDA), that is used to process
    incoming email in accordance with a set of specified rules or actions. These actions
    can include forwarding email to a different address, routing flagged spam messages
    into a Junk folder, sending auto-reply messages, and so forth. Processing can
    be applied to all incoming messages, or limited to messages that contain certain
    tags or strings.
