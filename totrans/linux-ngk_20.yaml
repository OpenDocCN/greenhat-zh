    up to now. In fact, I’ve had fewer problems than I mention in this section. Nevertheless,
    computers are computers, and operating systems, whether Windows, Mac, or Linux,
    are sufficiently complex to freak themselves out on occasion, as my friend put
    it. As it is impossible to anticipate every possible mishap that might occur to
    everyone, I’ve limited this section to the mostly minor problems that I or those
    around me have had. If you come up with problems of a different nature, try one
    of the online forums or mailing lists mentioned in the Appendices and ask your
    question there. Be sure to say that you are a Linux newbie, so that the responders
    will dumb-down their comments a tad. If you can’t grasp what they tell you to
    do, don’t be afraid to seek clarification.

    a different story entirely, and there is nothing much you can do in such situations
    other than replace the offending unit (most commonly a hard disk that conks out).
    Hardware failures are system independent, so they would happen even if you were
    using Windows on your machine. Don’t blame Linux if such problems happen on its
    watch, because it isn’t the cause.

  prefs: []

    and then enable them one by one, letting each one do its thing for a while to
    see if it is the problem. If your problem doesn’t recur, you can enable the next
    one and check it. And so on. The other way is to simply enable only one module
    and use it for a while. If your problem doesn’t recur, then you know that that
    module is safe. When you get sick of it, change to another module and use that
    one for a while. Eventually, you’ll discover the broken module.

- en: If you can read CDs without a hitch, but you just can’t burn them all of a sudden,
    the problem could be due to a USB storage device. The Linux kernel treats both
    CD drives and USB storage devices as SCSI devices (even if they are not). If you
    start up your machine with a USB storage device plugged in, the system might set
    up the SCSI devices so that the USB storage device is listed as **scsibus0**,
    and the CD drive as **scsibus0\.** When you try to burn a CD, the CD burner looks
    for the drive at **scsibus**If it’s not there, the burner doesn’t know what to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    root, and then typing in cdrecord -scanbus and pressing ENTER. If your CD drive
    is listed as **scsibus1** rather than **scsibus0**, you’ll know that you’ve identified
    the problem. To solve this problem, just unmount your USB storage device, unplug
    the device from your machine, and then restart the machine. Everything should
    be back to normal once your system is up and running again. At that point, you
    can also plug your USB storage device back in, if you like.
