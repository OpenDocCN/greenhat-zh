    more than the camera. The same applies to making great audio recordings—the person
    behind the gear matters more than the gear. This doesn’t mean that the gear doesn’t
    matter, because it does. But merely owning the most expensive, elite audio equipment
    won’t turn you into Tom Dowd or Rick Rubin or Quincy Jones or George Martin or
    whoever your favorite legendary music producer is. It won’t turn average musicians

- en: When you’re shopping for audio gear and getting drawn into the “higher specs
    and price tags is better!” zone, take a step back and reboot your mind. Take a
    deep breath, slow down, and concentrate on learning how to get the best out of
    lower-end equipment. Because today’s average digital audio gear is better than
    the top-of-the-line analog studio gear of yesteryear, with more accuracy, fidelity,
    wider dynamic range, and less noise, it’s a whole lot easier to record, mix, edit,
    and apply special effects. You won’t have to fuss so much with learning how to
    use your equipment, and you can concentrate more on learning how to make good
    recordings with artistic and technical fidelity. Then if you find yourself yearning
    for a better preamp, better microphones, better speakers, or what-have-you, you’ll
    have good reasons, and you’ll know and appreciate better quality when you find
    it.

    converter. The ADC/DAC is how you get analog audio in and out of your computer.
    It takes the analog signal from a microphone or instrument and converts it to
    a digital signal. Then it converts a digital signal to analog for playback. ADC/DACs
    come in a multitude of forms: The most low-end, cheapskate onboard sound chip
    has one, and of course so do higher-end audio interfaces. There are all kinds
    of USB and FireWire recording interfaces that connect microphones and instruments
    to your computer, and with them you don’t need to bother with an internal sound
    card at all. There are also slick little portable ADC/DACs for connecting turntables,

    it is an integrated mixer and 1200-watt amplifier. When I’m recording a live show,
    I hook up to it with a laptop and the MobilePre. I also have a Zoom H2 portable

    the musicians have to bring their own instrument amplifiers. This makes for a

    means the only instruments it hears are whatever the mics pick up. The Zoom H2

- en: Let’s take a closer look at the MobilePre because it is representative of a
    lot of USB recording interfaces. The MobilePre supplies 48v phantom power for
    condenser mics and has XLR and TRS jacks, a 1/8″ stereo input, two 1/4″ mono outputs,
    and a 1/8″ zero-latency headphone port for monitoring. Both dynamic and condenser
    mics can plug into the XLR jacks, as long as they have XLR connectors. You could
    also use an XLR-to-TRS adapter to plug a dynamic mic into one of the 1/4″ inputs.
    Its built-in ADC supports sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz at 16 bits, and it draws
    its power from the USB bus of your computer, so it doesn’t need its own power
    cord. It has physical gain control knobs and a volume control knob for headphones,
    so you don’t need to dink around with software controls. (I’d rather twist a knob
    than fumble around some weirdo software interface any day.) You should be able
    to find one for under $150\. At 16-bit/48 MHz maximum recording quality, it’s
    becoming obsolete because comparable devices support 24-bit recording. Still,
    it’s a great little device, and because it is USB 1.1 class-compliant, it runs
    on any computer without special drivers.

    1.1类规范，所以可以在任何电脑上运行，无需特殊驱动程序。

- en: Multichannel recording is done in several different ways. One way is to use
    a simple two-track recording interface like the MobilePre. It supports up to six
    inputs at once and routes them into two channels. There are no mixer controls,
    so this requires some finicking during recording to get a decent balance. A better
    way to do multichannel recording with a two-channel interface like the Pre is
    to record two tracks at a time, giving each instrument or performer its own individual
    track, rather than trying to cram them all through the Pre at once. Then Audacity
    is your mixer, and you have individual control of each track. Another option for
    two-channel recording is a good-quality two-channel PCI sound card like the Emu
    1616M PCI, which you can find used for under $200\. It comes with a breakout box
    that supports all kinds of plug-ins, 24-bit/192 kHz recording, phantom power,
    and preamps.

  zh: 多声道录音可以通过几种不同的方式进行。一种方式是使用简单的双轨录音接口，如MobilePre。它一次最多支持六个输入，并将它们路由到两个通道。没有混音控制，因此在录音时需要一些调整以获得良好的平衡。使用像Pre这样的双通道接口进行多声道录音的更好方法是同时录制两个轨道，为每个乐器或表演者分配其自己的独立轨道，而不是试图一次性将它们全部通过Pre。然后Audacity就是你的混音器，你可以对每个轨道进行单独控制。另一个双通道录音的选项是高质量的Emu
    1616M PCI双通道PCI声卡，你可以在200美元以下的价格找到二手的。它附带一个支持各种插件的分线盒，24位/192千赫录音，幻象电源和前置放大器。

    for recording. Any analog mixer will work as long you have an ADC/DAC to plug
    it into. My setup is a bit of a hack job since the Behringer is not really a studio
    mixer, but it works and sounds good, and it is an example of how a little ingenuity
    goes far in the wild world of audio. Like many mixers, the Behringer outputs to
    two-channel stereo, so I need to get the mix right during recording—I’ll have
    only two channels to work with in Audacity. I could also record one or two tracks
    at a time with the Behringer and then knit them together in Audacity; there is
    no rule that says you have to plug in everything at one time. (Though corralling
    and organizing musicians can be a bit of a cat-herding experience, and sometimes
    you have to take what you can get.)

    both ways at the same time. That’s 250 megabytes, not mega-bits. Plain old PCI
    maxes out at 133MBps. Also, unlike PCI-E, PCI uses a shared bus, so more PCI devices
    means more bandwidth contention. Every PCI-E device has its own dedicated data
    pipeline, so PCI-E devices don’t have to share bandwidth. USB 1.1 is rated at
    12Mbps (megabits per second), and USB 2.0 is rated at about 480Mbps, but both
    figures are highly theoretical, and in real life you’re likely to get half that.
    FireWire is rated at 400Mbps. However, FireWire gives you higher sustained throughput
    and better performance than USB, a difference that is discussed in more detail

    1.1的传输速率为12Mbps（每秒兆比特），而USB 2.0的传输速率约为480Mbps，但这两个数字都是高度理论化的，在现实生活中你很可能只能得到一半的速度。FireWire的传输速率为400Mbps。然而，FireWire提供的持续传输速率和性能优于USB，这一点将在下一节中更详细地讨论。

    CPUs make a big difference. A single-core CPU should perform fine for two-track
    recording and simpler recordings like podcasts and interviews. For example, I
    have an old ThinkPad with an 800 MHz CPU and 256MB RAM running Linux that performs
    nicely as a field recorder for interviews. For more than two tracks, multicore

    WAV) uses around 5MB per track per minute. Don’t forget to add up all the tracks
    you are using and all the retakes. You can buy terabyte hard drives, and by the
    time you read this, they’ll probably be even larger. Another option is to combine
    the capacity of several hard drives in a RAID (redundant array of inexpensive
    disks) array. The two RAID levels that are useful for audio production are RAID
    0 and RAID 10. RAID 0, also called *striping*, makes two hard disks look like
    one, so two 500GB drives appear as a single terabyte drive. RAID 0 is very fast
    but has the same weakness as a single drive—if one drive in the array fails, you’ll
    probably lose all of your data.

    0和RAID 10。RAID 0，也称为*条带化*，使得两个硬盘看起来像一个，所以两个500GB的硬盘看起来就像一个TB的硬盘。RAID 0非常快，但和单个硬盘一样有同样的弱点——如果阵列中的任何一个硬盘失败，你可能会丢失所有数据。

    so you get speed and redundancy. Use a good-quality hardware controller; you don’t
    want some cheapie that dumps more load on your CPU but instead one that handles
    the load itself. It’s more expensive of disks than the popular RAID 5, but it’s
    more reliable and a lot faster—you get faster reads and writes and much faster
    recovery from a failed drive. I wouldn’t use RAID 5 or 6 arrays for audio recording;
    in fact, I don’t use them at all anymore because they’re too fragile, they’re
    too slow for writes, and they propagate parity errors too readily.

    5要高，但它更可靠，速度也更快——你得到更快的读写速度，以及从失败的硬盘恢复得更快。我不会使用RAID 5或6阵列进行音频录音；实际上，我再也不使用它们了，因为它们太脆弱，写操作太慢，并且容易传播校验错误。

    and stutters. Turn off screensavers, all power management, and any antivirus or
    antimalware software. (Windows users, do I need to say, don’t be connected to
    the Internet after doing this?) Turn off all unnecessary services, scheduled jobs,
    and everything that is not essential.

  zh: 你的PC应该专门用于这项工作，不要用于其他任何事情，无论是游戏、上网、发电子邮件还是其他任何事情，因为你希望你的电脑的全部功率都用于录音。如果你不这样做，你可能会产生跳音和卡顿。关闭屏幕保护程序、所有电源管理以及任何防病毒或反恶意软件软件。（Windows用户，我需要说吗，在这样做之后不要连接到互联网？）关闭所有不必要的服务、计划任务以及所有非必要的事物。
- en: Your microphone will pick up noise, vibrations, and interference from a surprising
    number of sources. If you still have an old cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, replace
    it with a modern flat thin-film transistor liquid crystal diode (TFT-LCD) monitor,
    because CRTs emit radiation and noise. Sometimes they even resonate to certain
    sounds and create echoes.

  zh: 你的麦克风会从出人意料的多处拾取噪音、振动和干扰。如果你仍然有一个老式的阴极射线管（CRT）显示器，请将其更换为现代的平面薄膜晶体管液晶显示器（TFT-LCD），因为CRT会发出辐射和噪音。有时它们甚至会与某些声音产生共鸣并产生回声。
- en: You can make an effective sound barrier between mic and computer for cheap by
    attaching a piece of carpet to a piece of plywood or particle board. Give it feet
    so it stands on its own, and you have the equivalent of an expensive piece of
    a high-tech sound barrier. Both laptop and desktop machines should sit on nonresonating
    surfaces. In a pinch, you can set your laptop on a coat or a pillow, being careful
    to not block its cooling vents.

  zh: 你可以通过将一块地毯固定在一块胶合板或颗粒板上，以低廉的成本在麦克风和电脑之间建立一个有效的声音屏障。给它装上脚，让它自己站立，你就拥有了昂贵的高科技声音屏障的一部分。笔记本电脑和台式机都应该放在非共振表面上。在紧急情况下，你可以将笔记本电脑放在一件外套或一个枕头上，同时注意不要阻塞其散热通风口。

    microphones. It’s nasty for visitors to your studio—they may not appreciate breathing
    secondhand smoke and having to shower and change after they leave.

  zh: 吸烟对你的健康有害，对电脑和音频设备，尤其是麦克风来说也很糟糕。对访问你的工作室的人来说，这也很糟糕——他们可能不会欣赏吸二手烟，并在离开后淋浴和换衣服。
- en: Although many how-tos advise making your studio as acoustically “dead” as possible,
    without any echoes or resonance, feel free to experiment. You might like how some
    things sound in a space with some hard surfaces. Psycho-acoustics come into play
    in professional recording studios; they don’t make perfect anechoic chambers because
    those are so flat that they sound unpleasant. There is no sound reflection, nothing
    that gives depth to sound. So, professional studios reduce the amount of random
    noise while preserving some depth to the sound.

  zh: 尽管许多指南建议将你的工作室尽可能做成声学上“死”的，没有任何回声或共振，但请随意实验。你可能喜欢某些东西在具有一些硬质表面的空间中的声音。心理声学在专业录音室中发挥作用；它们不会制作完美的无回声室，因为那些地方太平，听起来不愉快。没有声音反射，没有任何给声音增加深度的事物。因此，专业录音室在保留声音深度的同时减少随机噪音。
