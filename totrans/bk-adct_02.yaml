    more than the camera. The same applies to making great audio recordings—the person
    behind the gear matters more than the gear. This doesn’t mean that the gear doesn’t
    matter, because it does. But merely owning the most expensive, elite audio equipment
    won’t turn you into Tom Dowd or Rick Rubin or Quincy Jones or George Martin or
    whoever your favorite legendary music producer is. It won’t turn average musicians

    and price tags is better!” zone, take a step back and reboot your mind. Take a
    deep breath, slow down, and concentrate on learning how to get the best out of
    lower-end equipment. Because today’s average digital audio gear is better than
    the top-of-the-line analog studio gear of yesteryear, with more accuracy, fidelity,
    wider dynamic range, and less noise, it’s a whole lot easier to record, mix, edit,
    and apply special effects. You won’t have to fuss so much with learning how to
    use your equipment, and you can concentrate more on learning how to make good
    recordings with artistic and technical fidelity. Then if you find yourself yearning
    for a better preamp, better microphones, better speakers, or what-have-you, you’ll
    have good reasons, and you’ll know and appreciate better quality when you find
    it.

    the musicians have to bring their own instrument amplifiers. This makes for a

    lot of USB recording interfaces. The MobilePre supplies 48v phantom power for
    condenser mics and has XLR and TRS jacks, a 1/8″ stereo input, two 1/4″ mono outputs,
    and a 1/8″ zero-latency headphone port for monitoring. Both dynamic and condenser
    mics can plug into the XLR jacks, as long as they have XLR connectors. You could
    also use an XLR-to-TRS adapter to plug a dynamic mic into one of the 1/4″ inputs.
    Its built-in ADC supports sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz at 16 bits, and it draws
    its power from the USB bus of your computer, so it doesn’t need its own power
    cord. It has physical gain control knobs and a volume control knob for headphones,
    so you don’t need to dink around with software controls. (I’d rather twist a knob
    than fumble around some weirdo software interface any day.) You should be able
    to find one for under $150\. At 16-bit/48 MHz maximum recording quality, it’s
    becoming obsolete because comparable devices support 24-bit recording. Still,
    it’s a great little device, and because it is USB 1.1 class-compliant, it runs
    on any computer without special drivers.

    a simple two-track recording interface like the MobilePre. It supports up to six
    inputs at once and routes them into two channels. There are no mixer controls,
    so this requires some finicking during recording to get a decent balance. A better
    way to do multichannel recording with a two-channel interface like the Pre is
    to record two tracks at a time, giving each instrument or performer its own individual
    track, rather than trying to cram them all through the Pre at once. Then Audacity
    is your mixer, and you have individual control of each track. Another option for
    two-channel recording is a good-quality two-channel PCI sound card like the Emu
    1616M PCI, which you can find used for under $200\. It comes with a breakout box
    that supports all kinds of plug-ins, 24-bit/192 kHz recording, phantom power,
    and preamps.

    mixer, but it works and sounds good, and it is an example of how a little ingenuity
    goes far in the wild world of audio. Like many mixers, the Behringer outputs to
    two-channel stereo, so I need to get the mix right during recording—I’ll have
    only two channels to work with in Audacity. I could also record one or two tracks
    at a time with the Behringer and then knit them together in Audacity; there is
    no rule that says you have to plug in everything at one time. (Though corralling

    to hook up. PCI Express is the fastest. One lane of PCI-E moves about 250MBps
    both ways at the same time. That’s 250 megabytes, not mega-bits. Plain old PCI
    maxes out at 133MBps. Also, unlike PCI-E, PCI uses a shared bus, so more PCI devices
    means more bandwidth contention. Every PCI-E device has its own dedicated data
    pipeline, so PCI-E devices don’t have to share bandwidth. USB 1.1 is rated at
    12Mbps (megabits per second), and USB 2.0 is rated at about 480Mbps, but both
    figures are highly theoretical, and in real life you’re likely to get half that.
    FireWire is rated at 400Mbps. However, FireWire gives you higher sustained throughput
    and better performance than USB, a difference that is discussed in more detail
    in the following section.

    interference from hard drives, power supplies, and fans inside your computer case.
    This usually isn’t a problem with the better sound cards like Emu, M-Audio, and
    RME Hammerfall, but it tends to be more of an issue with consumer-level and gamer
    sound cards and low-budget onboard sound. If you are getting some noise, the first
    thing to check is all your connections—make sure everything is hooked up correctly
    and anything that needs to be grounded is grounded. Sometimes moving a PCI card
    to a different slot makes a difference. Check your motherboard manual to see if
    you have shared PCI slots; you don’t want to use a shared slot if the other slot
    is populated.

    manufacturers have been slow to release USB 2.0 recording interfaces, though there

    There are two common types of microphones: condenser and dynamic. *Condenser*

    through the microphone cable, because there isn’t a separate power cable. They
    are more fragile than dynamic mics. Condenser mics live mostly in studios. They
    are also used onstage in combination with dynamic mics on drum kits; the condenser
    mics hang overhead to capture cymbals and transients, and dynamic mics are placed
    next to the drums. [Figure 2-9](ch02s04.html#audio-technica_stereo_condenser_mic_comm

    Dynamic mics use both XLR connectors and TRS plugs. Dynamic mics do not require
    phantom power, so make sure that the phantom power is turned off before you plug
    one in to a phantom-powered XLR jack. It shouldn’t damage the mic, but it will
    change how it sounds. It’s common to see audio gear with both types of microphone
    connectors, and newer devices have combination jacks that accept both.

    depth, and realism. They revolutionized the audio industries back in the 1930s;
    ribbon microphones set new standards for realism and accuracy that the condenser
    mics of the day could not match. Ribbon mics fell out of favor somewhat as condenser
    and dynamic mics improved. They were expensive, the metal ribbon was fragile,
    and their output was so low they needed more amplification than other types of
    microphones. Modern ribbon mics are more affordable and durable and produce louder
    output than their ancestors, so they’re definitely worth trying ([Figure 2-10](ch02s04.html#a_modern_aea_r84_ribbon_mic

    from both the front and the rear of the mic in a figure-eight pattern. They are
    effective at blocking sound from the sides. The figure-eight pattern is on the
    horizontal axis, so you can tip them sideways to get a different effect. A pair
    of matched ribbon mics placed next to each other at a 90-degree angle is called
    a *Blumlein pair*, or crossed figure eight. This creates a realistic stereo image.
    If you don’t want to capture sounds from one side, for example the audience side,
    you’ll have to block it somehow or find a ribbon mic with the capture pattern

    cables. In the context of connecting microphones, an unbalanced cable is a coaxial
    cable that terminates in a tip-sleeve (TS) connector. It has a single conductor
    wire surrounded by a combination shield and ground. These are effective at blocking
    external interference but are vulnerable to induced hum and noise and tend to
    be noisier than balanced cables. A balanced cable terminates in either a three-pin
    XLR connector or a TRS connector. It has two internal wires, one hot and one cold,
    surrounded by a shield that is not part of the signal path, so it supplies a cleaner
    signal. Balanced cables can run for much longer distances than unbalanced cables
    without picking up excessive noise.
  prefs: []

    a balanced cable will not make an unbalanced signal balanced. However, a TS cable
    will convert a balanced signal to unbalanced. You need to match your cables to
    your mics and your preamp, amp, mixer, or whatever you might be plugging into.
    Condenser mics that depend on phantom power mostly likely use three-pin XLR balanced
    cables, and dynamic micsuse balanced cables with both XLR and TRS connectors.

    the distance between the mic and the sound source. If there are multiple amps

    fix up a netbook as a portable recording studio or to use a portable digital recorder.
    Netbooks are so cool; I’ve been wishing for netbooks ever since I discovered computers.
    Ordinary laptops work fine too, and you get more powerful CPUs. You have all the
    same options as you do with a desktop computer—your choice of preamps, mixers,
    and other audio interfaces, microphones, software—and you can do all of your editing
    on the spot and even burn CDs. You also have a nice screen and keyboard, instead
    of the tiny screens and buttons found on portable digital recorders.

    one in your pocket and carry it anywhere. Carry extra batteries and some extra
    storage cards, and you’re ready for anything. My personal favorite is the Zoom
    Handy H2 ([Figure 2-12](ch02s09.html#the_zoom_h2_with_an_rca-to-1_solidus_8p "Figure 2-12. The
    Zoom H2 with an RCA-to-1/8″ stereo plug adapter for connecting to a mixer or any
    other two-channel stereo RCA recording or line output")). It runs on two AA batteries
    and also has an AC adapter. It has four built-in good-quality microphones, so
    you can record either in two-channel stereo or in four-channel surround. It has
    no speakers, but it comes with earbuds, and it can also be used as a USB audio
    interface on a computer. Its 1/8″ line input can be connected directly to the
    sound board at concerts, and it also accepts an external microphone. It uses SD
    cards for storage and supports both WAV and MP3 file formats. It costs about $150.

    LS10, Marantz PMD 620, Marantz PMD 660, Sony PCM-D50, Yamaha Pocketrak 2G, and
    Zoom H4\. All are under $600, and all have built-in mics. Ideally you’ll be able
    to get your hands on them and give them good test drives before purchase because
    they share a common weakness—tiny LCD control panels with complicated menus. You’ll
    also want to test noise levels, because some of them are nice and quiet when you
    use the internal mics but are scratchety with external mics. Most of them accept
    external mics—some have only 1/8″ mini-jacks, and some accept full-sized XLR or
    TRS plugs. The ones that have XLR jacks don’t always supply phantom power for
    condenser mics. A nice option is to use a battery-powered condenser mic, and then
    you don’t have to worry about phantom power.

    The most important factor is blocking out unwanted noises. Our brains are wonderful
    at ignoring sounds we don’t want to pay attention to, but microphones give equal
    attention to all noises. Blocking unwanted noise is harder than it sounds because
    our modern world is very noisy: vehicle traffic, airplanes, appliances, televisions
    and stereos, fluorescent lights, $2,000 powered subwoofers roaming the streets
    at 120 decibels in $500 cars, construction, and so forth. High-frequency noises
    are easier to block than low-frequency sounds, as we all know from our futile
    attempts to escape those four-wheeled powered subwoofers, which pound their way
    through all barriers.'

    studios, and no one would ever holler, “Quiet on the set!” You can mitigate problems
    somewhat in Audacity, but you get better results making as good a recording as
    possible and saving the fix-its for problems you can’t avoid. It’s nothing like
    crime shows where ace audio techs can clean up any recording, no matter how mangled,

    no human sounds at all. In 1992 he recorded the chorus of dawn around the globe.
    In later years he recorded the sounds of the Mississippi river according to the
    writings of Mark Twain and the sounds of Yosemite National Park according to the
    writings of John Muir. He uses a Neumann KU-81i Dummy Head (named Fritz) to simulate

    things sound in a space with some hard surfaces. Psycho-acoustics come into play
    in professional recording studios; they don’t make perfect anechoic chambers because
    those are so flat that they sound unpleasant. There is no sound reflection, nothing
    that gives depth to sound. So, professional studios reduce the amount of random
    noise while preserving some depth to the sound.
