- en: Many Wi-Fi users never install or maintain an access point—they connect to public
    hot spots in coffee shops and libraries and maybe in the workplace, where there's
    a network manager to worry about providing a signal to their computers. But if
    you want to use Wi-Fi in your own small business or home network, you'll have
    to know something about access points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An *access point*, or *base station*, in a wireless network is the central transmitter
    and receiver that exchanges data by radio with individual computers and other
    network clients. Multiple access points can increase the size of the area served
    by the network and support a larger number of network clients, but every Wi-Fi
    network must include at least one access point. The number and location of your
    network's access points defines its coverage and capacity.

    You can unpack all the boxes, hook up the radios to your computers, and try to
    make it all work, or you can do some advance planning and think about the best
    locations for each component before you start playing with hardware. This chapter
    is for those conscientious and methodical people who plan first and install things
    later. It''s also for the rest of us who tried to fire up a network without any
    planning, and now we want to learn how to do the job properly.'

    matter, any LAN—is to spend some time thinking about exactly how you expect to
    use the network. Are all of the computers in your network in fixed locations with
    easy access to cable runs? Are you thinking about wireless because it's the best
    way to add computers and users to your network or just because it's the flavor
    of the month?

    use wireless to extend my home network from the front room to the kitchen (and
    I did, when I was testing equipment for this book), but it's almost as easy to
    use a gateway router and the built-in Ethernet interface adapters in my computers
    and string cable through the basement rafters instead. On the other hand, if I
    wanted to use my laptop computer on the front porch or the back yard as well as
    the kitchen, or if I lived in a two-story house or an apartment where I couldn't
    get inside the ceilings or under the floors, then it could make sense to install
    an access point in the front room and a wireless network card in the laptop so
    I could carry it from place to place.

    the computers are stationary and you have an easy way to run cables (such as a
    false ceiling or cable conduits in the walls and floors), a wired network is usually
    the better choice. But if the salespeople all carry portables when they call on
    customers, or the engineers want to use their laptop machines in meetings or over
    lunch, or if there's some other good reason to extend the network beyond the reach
    of cables, it's probably time to add wireless access.

    points are combined with other devices, such as network routers, broadband Internet

    must include a radio transmitter and receiver, one or two captive antennas or
    connectors for external antennas, and (usually) an Ethernet port for connecting
    the access point to a wired network. The access point should also contain some
    kind of internal configuration software that displays the current settings and
    accepts commands to make changes.

    DHCP eliminates the need to manually assign a separate address to each computer,
    it can save a lot of time and trouble, but when the network hub or switch and
    the wireless access point both try to act as DHCP servers, or when a client device
    expects a specific address but the DHCP server assigns an address on the fly,
    trying to set up the network can become ugly.

    a LAN. Some standalone access points expect to receive requests for access to
    the web-based configuration screens at a specific numeric IP address. When that
    access point is connected to a hub that is acting as a DHCP server, however, the
    server assigns a different IP address to the access point. So when a user tries
    to connect to the IP address listed in the access point manual, nothing happens
    (or the browser reports "unable to find this address," which is about the same
    thing).

    LAN includes another DHCP server (usually in a router) that assigns numeric addresses,
    it's best to disable the DHCP function in the access point and allow the main
    server to handle address assignments for the entire network, including both wired
    and wireless nodes. As a general rule, the active DHCP server should be in the
    device closest to your Internet connection—usually the DSL modem or cable modem
    or other Internet access device.

    Find the manual, and try to follow those instructions as closely as possible.
    When you do come up with a combination of access point configuration settings
    and Windows networking settings that actually works (and it's a safe bet that
    such a combination does exist), note those settings on paper and store them with

    network access only in common areas, such as a conference room, a reception area,
    or a library. Or you might want to share a single broadband network connection

    it looks messy, and somebody will almost certainly yank it out eventually. Your

    and either drop the cable inside the wall or run it flush to a corner of two walls.
    Remember to avoid sharply bending or crimping the network cable; be sure to allow
    for a broad curve. When you want to use a single access point to serve two adjacent
    floors of a building, the best location would be as close to the shared ceiling

    occurs when the same signal reaches a receiving antenna directly from the transmitter
    and again a fraction of a second later after bouncing off a reflective surface.
    On a broadcast television signal, multipath appears on the screen as a ghost or
    shadow image. In a packet data network, the receiver treats multipath interference
    as noise, which can slow down the transmission speed. Many access points and network
    adapters use two separate antennas in a "diversity" receiving arrangement to reduce
    or eliminate the impact of multipath interference. The receiver compares the strength
    of the signal from each antenna and automatically selects the better one. Even
    though the two antennas might be located just an inch or two apart, a diversity
    system can often provide a cleaner output than a single antenna. If the access
    point's built-in antenna is inside a package with an odd form, such as a *U*-shaped
    bar, or if it has two separate antennas, the device is probably using a diversity
    receiving system. The best way to find out if your hardware uses diversity is

    the box under cover and run a coaxial cable to the antenna. A weatherproof vertical
    antenna on a roof or a flat-panel antenna mounted high on the side of a building
    should provide decent line-of-sight coverage up to 300 feet away. When you place

    high up might make it invisible to users above or below it, while a 5 dB or lower
    antenna might provide perfect coverage. Always make sure to install proper grounding

    half a mile, you won't have to worry about interference to your network, but that's
    becoming less likely every day. Other network services, along with cordless phones,
    microwave ovens, outdoor lighting systems, and radio-controlled toys, all use
    the same set of frequencies. In addition, several nearby home or office networks
    are probably using their own Wi-Fi networks. It's often a radio jungle out there.

    to overcome interference from all those other services. That's the theory. The
    engineers who work with the various 2.4 GHz radio services are trying to cooperate
    so we can all use our networks, phones, microwaves, and toys at the same time.
    In practice, however, the receivers in your access points and network adapters
    might listen to the channel that is supposed to contain a nice, clean Wi-Fi signal
    and perform the digital equivalent of throwing their hands into the air and shouting
    "Arrrgh!"

    the signal waits for an acknowledgment that never comes and then sends the same

    clean copy. This means that the channel not only has to be clear enough for the
    original packet to reach the client but clear enough for the acknowledgment to
    reach the original sender. The same thing happens with the next packet, and the
    one after that, and the one after that. This has the same effect as trying to
    conduct a voice conversation over a noisy phone line or a walkie-talkie, where

    when it's receiving, but the performance characteristics are identical. The same
    antenna that increases the effective radiated output power of a transmitted signal
    also boosts the sensitivity of a receiver by the same amount; an antenna connected

    signals moving in both directions across the radio link. The most important characteristics

    strength extends 10 degrees to each side of the front of the antenna. The signal
    strength will drop when both antennas in a radio link are not within the aperture
    angle of the other. [Figure 9-7](ch09s06.html#directional_antennas_can_increase_signal

    side of the light source, or if you focus the light in a particular direction,
    the apparent brightness of the light will increase within the target area, but
    it will look dimmer when you move away from the target area. The total amount
    of light radiated by the bulb is the same, but more of that light is concentrated
    in certain places.

    source of interference off axis from the aperture angle so the receiving antenna
    is much less sensitive to the source of interference than to the signal you want.

    it can make a huge difference over longer runs. If the antenna is high on a tower
    or rooftop, or if you're trying to estimate the antenna gain necessary for a long
    point-to-point link, you must allow for cable loss when you calculate the strength
    of the signal reaching the antenna. The amount of loss in a particular type of
    cable depends on the diameter of the cable and the materials used to produce the
    cable. The specifications for each type of cable will include the amount of attenuation,
    often expressed in dB per 100 feet at different operating frequencies.

    0.2; 0.2 x 6.80 dB = ~1.3 dB). If the output power from an access point or network
    adapter is 20 dBm (100 milliwatts), the antenna will only receive 18.7 dBm (74.1
    milliwatts) through that cable. So when you push that signal through an antenna
    with a gain of 6 dBi, the effective radiated power would be about 24.7 dB (20
    – 1.3 + 6 = 24.7), or about 295 milliwatts.

    floor just because the premade cable is longer than you need. All that cable wastes
    signal with no compensating benefit.

    guideline is 0.3 dB of loss per connector, so a short pigtail connector from a
    wireless card to a standard antenna connector would include two connectors, then
    both ends of the long cable run would have two more, and the connector on the
    antenna itself would be a fifth point of loss. Therefore, in addition to the loss
    of the cabling itself, you will have an additional 1.5 dB of loss due to connectors.
    Whenever possible, keep the number of connectors in your antenna cable to a minimum.

- en: Experience can give you a pretty accurate idea of how much demand will exist
    at any given moment—you might not know exactly who is online at 10:15 on a Tuesday
    morning, but you can predict how many streetcars or how much bandwidth you will
    need to handle the demand.

- en: In the case of an Internet account, the ISP has built enough bandwidth to handle
    the peak demand (in an office, it's probably first thing in the morning and at
    lunchtime; in a residential neighborhood, it's after school). But if that demand
    doubles, they'll have to buy and install more equipment and find a source of revenue
    to pay for it. They want to prevent the kind of unexpected additional demands
    for bandwidth that can break down the whole system, or, more accurately, they
    want to know about it and plan (and charge) accordingly.

    and follow its guidelines (which might mean finding a different ISP); go ahead
    and install your neighborhood access points and hope the telephone company, cable
    service, or other ISP doesn''t find out about it; or investigate a commercial
    connection type such as synchronous DSL or even a T1-class line, which will cost
    more but should have less restrictive terms of use.'

- en: The most basic configuration of a neighborhood network is a single access point
    with a wide coverage footprint and an unprotected connection to the Internet.
    Anybody with a network adapter within range of your signal can use your network
    to exchange data through the Internet. That includes the family next door, but
    it also includes the guy in the van parked on the street who's using your network
    to download pornography.

- en: Turn on WEP or WPA key encryption. This one is crucial. It's true that a dedicated
    intruder can crack a WEP key in less than an hour, but it does discourage the
    casual drive-by user and serves as a "do not disturb" sign.

- en: Use MAC address filtering to restrict access to your network to specific network
    adapters. Again, it's not difficult to spoof a MAC address with the right software,
    but it's one more impediment to unauthorized access.

- en: If you're using the same network to link two or more of your own computers,
    use a firewall to isolate that part of the network from the public access point.
    Encourage all of the legitimate users of your network to pay close attention to
    file sharing so they don't allow outsiders to read or write the data stored on
    their computers. Also, be sure to change the access point's administrative password.
    Do not use *admin* or any other widely used default password. An intruder who
    breaks into your access point can cause massive damage to your network.
