The engine behind this is called Advanced Package Tool (APT), which allows you to easily download, install, update, and remove software packaged in DEB archives, or <span class="emphasis"><em>packages</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0430" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0431" class="indexterm"/></p><p>APT is a rather foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go missing, since it automatically downloads and installs any files that the main application you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called <span class="emphasis"><em>dependencies</em></span>, proves to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The painful quest of finding and then installing this file or that, as well as any dependencies that those files themselves might have, has led to the missing dependency problem being referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>dependency hell</em></span>. APT makes that pretty much a thing of the past.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0432" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0433" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0434" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So, where does APT find all these files and applications? Well, the packages that APT searches for, downloads, and installs are located in a set of specific online repositories. These <span class="emphasis"><em>repositories</em></span> are online servers in which a great number of applications, support files, and more are stored for use with your particular system. All of the files that originally came bundled with your system, including the system (kernel) itself and updates, when available, are stored there too. This is quite unlike Windows or Mac OS, where you normally need to buy a CD or download an installer file from a website to get new software.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0435" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might consider a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means you control it via commands in a command Terminal. Fortunately, Ubuntu has a number of different graphical frontends for APT that allow you to bypass the command line and make everything about as easy as you could ever hope it would be. In this chapter, you will be focusing on three of these frontends.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0436" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Project 6A: Installing Applications via the Ubuntu Software Center"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_6a_colon_installing_applications"/>Project 6A: Installing Applications via the Ubuntu Software Center</h1></div></div></div><p>By far, the easiest to use of the APT frontends is the Ubuntu Software Center. Being the most graphically satisfying of the frontends, it is especially useful when it comes to browsing for cool or handy applications. To get a feel for it, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Ubuntu Software Center</strong></span>. The window that opens will look similar to <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#the_ubuntu_software_center" title="Figure 6-1. The Ubuntu Software Center">Figure 6-1</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0439" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0440" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0441" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0437" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0438" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_ubuntu_software_center"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e5956"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656228.png.jpg" alt="The Ubuntu Software Center"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-1. The Ubuntu Software Center</p></div><p>As you can see, items in the Ubuntu Software Center are categorized pretty much in the same manner as in the Ubuntu Applications menu. If you click any of the department icons in the main pane of the window, you will jump to a list of all the items available for that category. Applications that you've already installed are marked with a green check mark over their icons, while those that are not installed just display the plain icon. Not surprisingly, you will find that the installed items within each category mirror those in the relevant submenu of the Applications menu. To see a list of all your installed programs, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Installed Software</strong></span> item in the pane on the left side of the window.</p><div class="sect2" title="6A-1: Selecting Applications for Installation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_selecting_applications_for_ins"/>6A-1: Selecting Applications for Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>The Ubuntu Software Center can install multiple applications simultaneously, so to give it a whirl, you can try installing a few interesting applications in this section. Let's start by selecting the very cool and decidedly useful address book application Rubrica (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#rubricama_very_cool_address_book" title="Figure 6-2. Rubrica—a very cool address book">Figure 6-2</a>). To select Rubrica, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> department in the main pane of the window, scroll down the list of available applications, and double-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Rubrica Addressbook</strong></span> item. A page containing information about Rubrica will be displayed. All you need to do now is click <span class="strong"><strong>Install - Free</strong></span> and type your password if prompted. This will start the installation.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0442" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0443" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0444" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0445" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A progress indicator will appear on the page while Rubrica is downloaded and installed. Once the installation has completed, the Rubrica page will reload with a green check icon next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Installed</em></span> to show that it was added to your computer successfully. That's all there is to it! Select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Rubrica Addressbook</strong></span> to start the program.</p><div class="figure"><a id="rubricama_very_cool_address_book"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6024"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656230.png.jpg" alt="Rubrica—a very cool address book"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-2. Rubrica—a very cool address book</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="6A-2: Searching for Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-2_colon_searching_for_applications"/>6A-2: Searching for Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>Next up is Sound Converter (which I'll talk more about using in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. TUX ROCKS">Chapter 14</a>). Scrolling through the list of programs can be tedious, so this time, try using the search feature: Type <span class="strong"><strong>Sound Converter</strong></span> into the search box at the top right of the screen, and watch as the search results fly in. Sound Converter should appear at the top of the list of results, so select it and click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span>. The installation will start like before—but this time, try clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Get Software</strong></span> while the program is still installing.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0446" class="indexterm"/></p><p>All the installation magic will continue in the background, and you can still browse for other programs. No need to wait!</p><p>Finally, let's add a useful utility by the name of Sysinfo (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#keeping_tabs_on_your_system_information" title="Figure 6-3. Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo">Figure 6-3</a>), which is a system profiler that can tell you all sorts of things about your computer. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>sysinfo</code></strong> in the search box, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Sysinfo</strong></span> search result that appears, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to add it to the installation queue. It'll be installed as soon as the Ubuntu Software Center has finished dealing with Sound Converter.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0447" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can run the applications you've installed by going to the Applications menu and looking in the submenu that matches the Ubuntu Software Center "department" where you found the program—that would be Office for Rubrica, Sound &amp; Video for Sound Converter, and System Tools for Sysinfo.</p><div class="figure"><a id="keeping_tabs_on_your_system_information"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6071"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656232.png.jpg" alt="Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-3. Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="6A-3: Uninstalling Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-3_colon_uninstalling_applications"/>6A-3: Uninstalling Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>As you can see, installing applications via the Ubuntu Software Center is quite simple. And fortunately, it's just as easy to uninstall them. Navigate to (or search for) the program you want to remove, click it once in the list, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button that appears. Enter your password again if asked, and watch as the program is uninstalled.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0449" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0450" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0451" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0452" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0453" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0454" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0455" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0456" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0457" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0448" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Performing System Upgrades via Update Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="performing_system_upgrades_via_update_ma"/>Performing System Upgrades via Update Manager</h1></div></div></div><p>The second graphical frontend for APT that I'll cover in this chapter is Update Manager, which is used for updating your system. Updates are made available quite regularly and consist of newer versions of packages you already have installed. Most of the time a newer version will have been released because it fixes some security issue, but updates can also fix problems with software and introduce new features.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0458" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0459" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To get started, select <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Update Manager</strong></span>, and make sure that the Ubuntu Software Center isn't currently installing or removing anything (you can't use two APT frontends at the same time). Once the Update Manager window appears (<a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#upgrading_packages_en_masse_via_update_m" title="Figure 6-4. Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager">Figure 6-4</a>), click the <span class="strong"><strong>Check</strong></span> button to make sure the package information is as up-to-date as possible. You will then be prompted for your password. Type it, and after a short while, a list of all the available updates will appear in the Update Manager window.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0460" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="upgrading_packages_en_masse_via_update_m"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6177"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656234.png.jpg" alt="Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-4. Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager</p></div><p>If there are any applications you don't want to upgrade, you can go through the list and uncheck the box next to their names. But for now, it's safest to just leave all the boxes checked. Either way, once you're ready, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install Updates</strong></span> button. The selected updates will then be downloaded and installed. Once the installation is complete, you will be notified in a separate window. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span> in that window and in the Update Manager window to finish up. Depending on what you installed, another notification may appear telling you that you will have to restart your system in order for the changes to take effect. If so, it is best to be obedient and reboot.</p><div class="sect2" title="How Often Should You Install Updates?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_often_should_you_install_updates_que"/>How Often Should You Install Updates?</h2></div></div></div><p>Ubuntu will check for updates every day, and the Update Manager window will appear on your desktop if it finds any. If this is happening too often and you find yourself being pestered by updates, select <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Software Sources</strong></span>. When the Software Sources window appears, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Updates</strong></span> tab (<a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#the_updates_tab_in_the_software_sources" title="Figure 6-5. The Updates tab in the Software Sources window">Figure 6-5</a>), and under Automatic updates, change the Check for updates option to something else. Weekly updates should be fine.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0461" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0462" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0463" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You'll find a couple of other interesting options there too. If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Install security updates without confirmation</strong></span>, updates will happen automatically, without any intervention from you. Alternatively, you can choose to have updates download in the background so they'll be ready to install immediately when Update Manager pops up.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0464" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_updates_tab_in_the_software_sources"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6242"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656236.png.jpg" alt="The Updates tab in the Software Sources window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-5. The Updates tab in the Software Sources window</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="If an Update Ruins Your Day . . . or System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="if_an_update_ruins_your_day_._._._or_sys"/>If an Update Ruins Your Day . . . or System</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, I don't want to worry you too much, but one thing about massive system updates is that afterward sometimes things just go all screwy, leaving you with all sorts of regrets and a mouthful of expletives just waiting to be uttered. This is a fact of life no matter what operating system you are using. It can happen in Windows, it can happen in Mac OS, and it can happen in Linux. Therefore, it is always a good idea to wait a bit before installing a seemingly major update and to check the user forums first to see whether there are any disaster stories about a particular update. Leaving a week between noticing an update and installing it should protect you from most rare mishaps, but there are no guarantees.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0465" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0466" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0467" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0468" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0469" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0470" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0471" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0472" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>To decide whether an update is "major," look for updates with <span class="emphasis"><em>linux-</em></span> in their name (<span class="emphasis"><em>linux-generic</em></span>, for example, as seen in <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#updates_with_linux_in_their_name_are_usu" title="Figure 6-6. Updates with linux in their name are usually important system packages">Figure 6-6</a>).

All is not lost. In fact, nothing is lost . . . most likely. Just start up your machine again. If you have a dual-boot system, you will arrive at the GRUB boot menu, just like always. If you're not a dual-booter, you'll have to get to this menu by holding down shift as soon as you start the computer. Don't let go of the shift key until the GRUB menu appears (or Ubuntu starts, in which case you missed your cue, and you'll have to restart the computer and try again).<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0474" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In the GRUB menu, you will see that you seem to have more than one Ubuntu system installed on your hard disk, which is true to some extent. For a short-term fix, you can take advantage of this by traveling back in time to the core system (the Linux kernel) that you had in place before your ill-fated upgrade. Just use your arrow keys to select a kernel that ends in a number lower than the highest (2.6.32-20 rather than 2.6.32-22, for example), press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>voilá</em></span>, you are back to the system you have come to know and love. You'll have to do this each time you start up your machine, but at least you will have the chance to back up your valuable files before doing some research on the problem and trying again later.</p><p>With all this disaster and recovery talk, I hope I haven't scared you away from the idea of updating your system. After all, chances are great that nothing like this will ever happen to you. Still, it is good to know that if things do go awry, there is no need for panic. You've got backup.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Adding Extra Software Repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="adding_extra_software_repositories"/>Adding Extra Software Repositories</h1></div></div></div><p>The Ubuntu software repositories contain more than 30,000 packages—enough to last a lifetime, or so you might think. But as it turns out, a whole world of software is waiting for you outside the official Ubuntu repositories, and it's not much more difficult to reach. Various individuals and companies compile small numbers of packages that are not available in Ubuntu into their own <span class="emphasis"><em>third-party repositories</em></span>. These are typically free to access, if you can find them. All you need to do is tell APT to search for packages in one of these repositories as well as Ubuntu's, and you'll be able to get at the extra software.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0475" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0476" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0477" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0478" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0479" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0480" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0481" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0482" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0483" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0484" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0485" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0486" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Each repository has its own <span class="emphasis"><em>APT line</em></span>. This is similar to a web address but contains extra information about the repository, which APT uses to figure out what sort of packages it contains. You'll need to get the correct APT line from the website of the repository you're trying to add, so let's pick an example to see how it works. Open Firefox, and head over to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install">http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install</a>. GetDeb specializes in making packages for software that hasn't officially made it into Ubuntu yet. There should be some instructions on installing packages from GetDeb in a box at the top of the page, so skip to the second item in the list and find the APT line, which should look something like this: <code class="literal">deb</code> <a class="ulink" href="http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu">http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu</a> <code class="literal">lucid-getdeb apps</code>. This follows the same format as all APT lines: the word <code class="literal">deb</code>, followed by a web address, followed by a couple of other words that specify which part of the repository should be checked by APT when it's looking for programs. Highlight the APT line, right-click it, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0487" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0488" class="indexterm"/></p><p>While you're in Firefox, you'll also need to grab the repository's <span class="emphasis"><em>GPG key</em></span> (which I'll explain more at the end of this section). It should be linked to from the same website you got the APT line from; in the case of GetDeb, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key">http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key</a>; when the Opening getdeb-archive.key window opens, select <span class="strong"><strong>Save File</strong></span>, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save the key file.</p><p>Now that you're in possession of these vital bits of information, adding the repository to your system is pretty straightforward:<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0489" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Software Sources</strong></span>.

It was related to a security measure that checks whether the packages are from where you think they're from. (In theory, it's possible that someone could hijack a repository and put harmful fake packages in there.) If you don't add the GPG key, the Ubuntu Software Center will refuse to display any of the packages from the repository since it won't trust it. Having the GPG key isn't enough to keep you completely safe from nasty surprises, though. You should always exercise caution when using a third-party (that is, non-Ubuntu) repository; make sure it's trustworthy before you add it.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0491" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="APT-URL: Installing from Websites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="apt-url_colon_installing_from_websites"/>APT-URL: Installing from Websites</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you've added GetDeb to the list of available software repositories, you can take advantage of yet another APT frontend.

There are all sorts of little programs out there that someone has written to scratch an itch of theirs, and plenty of them are available to you, for free, if you know where to get them. Luckily, most of them can now be found in personal package archives (PPAs) on Ubuntu's project website, Launchpad. PPAs are miniature software repositories and are an easy way for people to share their home-brewed software with others (emphasis on the home-brewed—sometimes software from PPAs doesn't work). You can find software in PPAs by visiting <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas</a> and searching for what you want.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0498" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0499" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0500" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0501" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0502" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0503" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In this example, you'll see how to install OpenSonic, an open source remix of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog game (see <a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html#playing_opensonic" title="Figure 6-10. Playing OpenSonic">Figure 6-10</a>):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Type <span class="strong"><strong>lucid games</strong></span> into the search box at <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas</a>, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Search</strong></span> to get underway.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The first search result should be Games (Lucid), so click that link, and look at the section titled <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding this PPA to your system</em></span> on the page that loads.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Copy the bit that says <code class="literal">ppa:falk-t-j/games</code>—it's a shortcut that you can use to add this repository, instead of having to use the more cumbersome APT line.

Some Ubuntu developers use PPAs to make the latest versions of software available, albeit in an unofficial and untested manner. If a major new version of OpenOffice.org or Firefox comes out, for example, keep your ear to the Ubuntu forums (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) to see whether someone has made the latest and greatest available through their PPA.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0504" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

And although it might seem that these repositories contain just about every piece of software possible, certain packages, for one reason or another, will never find their way into a repository. Skype is one of these packages.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0506" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0507" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0508" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0509" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0510" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0511" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0512" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0513" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0514" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0505" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0515" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Skype, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06s05.html#skype" title="Figure 6-11. Skype">Figure 6-11</a>, is Voice over IP (VoIP) software that allows you to speak to other Skype users over the Internet, with the clarity of a regular telephone line. And the best part is, it doesn't cost anything—even if you call users overseas. Skype also offers paid services, such as SkypeOut, which allows you to call regular mobile and landline telephone numbers from your computer at a fraction of what it would normally cost from a regular telephone.</p><div class="figure"><a id="skype"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6822"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656248.png.jpg" alt="Skype"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-11. Skype</p></div><p>Although it is true that open source VoIP packages such as Ekiga Softphone are available in Ubuntu, they are not compatible with the much better known and more widespread Skype. Since it is very likely that the majority of people you know who are using a VoIP software package are using Skype, it only makes sense to use Skype so that you can easily communicate with them.</p><p>Because Skype is not available from the Ubuntu repositories, you will need to get it yourself from the Skype website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.skype.com/">http://www.skype.com/</a>). Once there, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button, which will automatically take you to the download page for Linux versions of Skype. On that page, click the link for Ubuntu, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Save File</strong></span> button in the window that appears.</p><p>Once the download is complete, you will find the Skype DEB package on your hard disk, probably in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> folder. Double-click that package to open the Package Installer window (<a class="xref" href="ch06s05.html#the_package_installer_window" title="Figure 6-12. The Package Installer window">Figure 6-12</a>). Click <span class="strong"><strong>Install Package</strong></span>, after which you will be prompted for your password.

If you find that you can't make calls or the sound doesn't work properly, take a look at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype/</a> for troubleshooting hints. Also, while we're on the topic of sound, remember that it is best to use Skype with a headset. Trying to talk with a stick microphone could cause feedback or echoes, because the microphone will pick up and transmit sounds from the speakers.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_package_installer_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e6874"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656250.png.jpg" alt="The Package Installer window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-12. The Package Installer window</p></div></div></body></html>
