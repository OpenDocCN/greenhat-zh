    methods are also out there, and each of them offers a unique combination of advantages
    and drawbacks. Wired LANs and connections through power lines are often faster
    and more convenient than Wi-Fi for fixed installations such as home and office
    networks; other radio services might be better for connecting your smartphone,

    frequencies and a different type of modulation, but from a user's point of view,
    they're all very similar. A built-in network adapter or a plug-in PC Card or USB
    adapter exchanges data with a network of base stations that covers an entire metropolitan
    area, highway corridor, or other large geographic region. Unlike Wi-Fi, there's
    no need to search for an access point before you connect your computer to the
    Internet; within the service area, you can assume that there's always a usable
    signal wherever you are. The characteristics that set each service apart from

    slower than Wi-Fi, and the cost of a monthly subscription is still relatively
    expensive (although both of these conditions might change in the next few years).

    EDGE, but the newer EV-DO Revision A (often called *Rev. A*) networks can operate
    at maximum download speeds up to about 2.4Mbps under ideal conditions (but the
    average speed is generally around 1.0 to 1.5Mbps, or maybe a little faster). Therefore,
    you should make sure that your modem and your local service provider are both
    capable of using Rev. A signals.

    same time. Allowing for handshaking and other network overhead, Rev. B should
    offer data transfer speed at about 4.5Mbps. By the time the broadband service
    providers complete their product development and marketing, it will probably be
    another few years before commercial Rev. B service becomes available.

    than Wi-Fi because the service does not share its operating frequency with other
    radio services, and the service provider controls the hardware at both ends of

    telephones to assign a unique electronic serial number (ESN) to each modem and
    restrict access to the network (and the Internet) to the ESNs that correspond
    to active accounts. In addition, a broadband connection to the Internet does not
    move through a LAN, so there's little or no risk that intruders could use a broadband

    network and the convenience of EDGE and EV-DO in a single network service. When
    they become available, WiMAX networks are expected to move data at a maximum speed
    of about 70Mbps. Even after you allow for a generous amount of overhead, that's
    obviously a lot faster than anything the current generation of broadband cellular
    services can offer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, full WiMAX service won't be widely available until mid-2008 at the
    earliest, and it will probably take the service providers several years after
    that to install base stations and offer comprehensive coverage across the country.
    By that time, it's possible that today's EDGE and EV-DO networks will be replaced
    by faster EV-DO (Rev. B) and other high-speed broadband methods. In the meantime,
    the two major US WiMAX players, Clearwire and Sprint Broadband, are using a slower
    pre-WiMAX technology that tops out at about 1.5Mbps (many users report even slower
    connections, depending on their location relative to the nearest radio tower).
    Between the two companies, pre-WiMAX is available in a growing number of locations.
    Pre-WiMAX services were initially offered as a wireless alternative to DSL and
    cable Internet services in offices, homes, and other fixed locations, but Clearwire
    also offers plug-in PC Cards and, eventually, built-in adapters for both Clearwire
    and Sprint's Xohm service will be available as an option in new laptop computers.
    When these become widely available, they're likely to become contenders in the
    wireless networking marketplace.

    Internet connections when they are within range of a base station. However, some
    users have reported reception problems when the tower is too far away or if there's
    thick foliage between the tower and their modems.

    next to a window for best performance, and Sprint uses a separate transceiver
    antenna mounted on the roof or an outside wall. Fixing poor signal quality is
    usually possible in a fixed-wireless system such as a home or office network,
    but it's less practical when you're using the same technology with a laptop computer
    in multiple locations. It remains to be seen whether pre-WiMAX will be practical
    as a use-it-anywhere wireless Internet access method. When true WiMAX becomes
    available, the existing pre-WiMAX service providers will supply free or low-cost
    replacement hardware and software to all their subscribers.

    a completely different type of radio modulation and (probably) a different set
    of frequencies. WiMAX signals will be easier to receive and less susceptible to
    interference than the current generation of pre-WiMAX services. In the long run,
    WiMAX might offer a near-ideal combination of high speed and wide coverage without
    the need to find a new signal and a new account in every new location. If WiMAX
    fulfills its technical potential, if the business model produces enough money
    to build widespread networks, and if the WiMAX providers don't take lessons in
    poor customer service from the cable television and cellular telephone companies,
    it might become the clear choice for wireless Internet access. In the meantime,
    pre-WiMAX is worth a look, but don't set your expectations too high.
