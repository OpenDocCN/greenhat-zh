<i class="calibre11">Customizing the Look, Feel, and Sound of Your System</i><a name="216" id="216"/><a name="IDX-69" id="IDX-69"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before entering the world of Linux, I had  used just about every desktop operating  system around. Despite the differences  among them all, however, one thing that I  eventually suffered from in each case was a kind of  visual boredom. I suppose you might call it GUI fatigue.  It wasn’t that I was tired of using a graphical interface; it  was just that I couldn’t help but get sick of looking at the  same old icons, window borders, and color schemes. Of  course, there were some changes that could be made, but  it just wasn’t possible to get around the basic look and feel  without add-ons that demanded a price in terms of  performance.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the features of Linux that pleased me to no end, and continues to do  so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don’t mean just the  icons and backgrounds, but everything, including the actual window borders and  controls. Add to that the variety of GUIs available for Linux that can be milked  for all their graphical worth, and you have a totally customizable system. Is it any  wonder that there are so many more Linux desktop screenshots out there on the  Web than for any other system?</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may not be as fickle as I am in terms of the look and feel of your system, but you can learn to use and enjoy all the graphical customization power that  Linux offers you as you work through this chapter.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are reluctant to alter the look of your present setup, you can set up a new  user account and experiment with making the changes in this chapter when  logged in to the new account. If you opt to go this route, your regular home  environment will remain untouched because look-and-feel customizations that  are performed in one user account do not affect other user accounts. When you  are all done with the project, you can then simply delete the new user account.  Either way, it’s up to you. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To set up a new user account, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Users and Groups</b>. </p>

Then type in  an easy-to-remember user password in the two password boxes; the one  you’re using for your present account will do just fine.

We are going to start off easy by just creating folders, but by the time we  get to the end of the process, you will have created a much wilder, and,  depending on how you look at things, gaudier desktop environment than you’ve  ever seen before. All of this is in good fun, of course, and when you are done, you should be able to completely and confidently customize things the way you want  on your own.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get started, open your user’s Home folder by clicking the Panel icon that you  created in <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>. Once you have done that, you will see that there is nothing  at all inside the Home folder except for a folder called Desktop, which basically  contains any files, folders, and shortcuts to programs that you have put on your  desktop. If you are anything like me, you will want to put an end to this rather  empty state of affairs by creating some folders in which you can organize your  files in the future.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The first folder you will create will be for your writings, which you’ll call “Documentia,” though you can, of course, change the name later if you like. You  can create a folder quite easily, much in the way you do in Windows, by either  clicking on the <b class="calibre13">File</b> menu and then selecting <b class="calibre13">Create Folder</b>, or by right-clicking  in an empty space within the Nautilus window and then selecting <b class="calibre13">Create Folder  </b>from the pop-up menu. An untitled folder will appear in the window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Having a folder titled “untitled” is, of course, a tad goofy, so you will want to  change that. The text in the box below the folder will already be highlighted, so just type <span>Documentia</span> and press ENTER. Once you have done that, the folder will  show its new name.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now you can repeat the process and create four more folders: <b class="calibre13">Photos</b> (for  your photos, of course), <b class="calibre13">Tarballs_and_RPMs</b> (where you can dump all the used  files you will install along the way in this book), <b class="calibre13">Thematics</b> (for files you will use  in customizing the look of your system), and <b class="calibre13">ogg</b> (the default directory for music  files you rip from music CDs with the program Grip). Once you have done all  this, your Home folder window should look like that in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU51">Figure 5-3</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You must admit, things do indeed look a bit better than before, but this is just the  beginning. To graphically remind yourself what each folder is for, you can add  little folder-top icons called <i class="calibre11">emblems</i>. These can be added to any folder or file. For  now, let’s add one to the Documentia folder by right-clicking it, and then, in the  pop-up menu, selecting <b class="calibre13">Properties</b>. When the Properties window shown in  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU52">Figure 5-4</a> opens, click the<b class="calibre13"> Emblems</b> tab and then scroll down until you see the  emblem called <b class="calibre13">documents</b>. Click the checkbox next to <b class="calibre13">documents</b> and then click  the <b class="calibre13">Close </b>button. The emblem should now appear on your folder. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve added those two emblems, your folders should look a bit spunkier.  Nevertheless, the background of the Nautilus window is still white. You need not  stand for that if you don’t want to; you can change that as well. To do so, just go  to the menu bar of your Home window, click the <b class="calibre13">Edit</b> menu, and select <b class="calibre13">Backgrounds and Emblems</b>. The Backgrounds and Emblems window will then appear  (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU53">Figure 5-5</a> on <a href="#IDX-74">page 74</a>).<a name="229" id="229"/><a name="IDX-73" id="IDX-73"/>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 5-5: </span> Choosing a background for your Nautilus window</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">From this window, you can drag any pattern into your Home window, or into any  other Nautilus window for that matter, and the pattern will then become the  background for all your Nautilus windows. So, for experience’s sake, scroll down  to find the pattern swatch called <b class="calibre13">Manila Paper</b>, and then drag it to the white  space of your Home window. Once you’re done, the previously white window  area will look like the wallpaper in a lawyer’s office. Very nice, if you like that  sort of thing. You can change it to a different background in the same way, of  course, or you can go back to the default white by dragging the <b class="calibre13">Reset </b>swatch into  the window.<a name="231" id="231"/><a name="IDX-74" id="IDX-74"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Apart from the buttons for pattern and color swatches, there is a third button in  the Backgrounds and Emblems window called <b class="calibre13">Emblems</b>. As you know, you’ve  already added emblems to a couple of your folders by right-clicking the folders  and selecting <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> in the pop-up menu. The <b class="calibre13">Emblems</b> button provides  another way to do the same thing, but this method is far handier when adding  emblems to several folders or files in the same go.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To see how this works, click the <b class="calibre13">Emblems</b> button if you haven’t already done  so. Then drag the emblem named<b class="calibre13"> Camera</b> onto your Photos folder, <b class="calibre13">Cool </b>onto  your Thematics folder, and <b class="calibre13">package</b> onto your Tarballs_and_RPMs folder. The  selected emblems will then immediately appear on those folders. (And in case you are wondering why some of the names of these emblems are capitalized and  some are not, I have no idea. Sorry.)</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now let’s go on to change the look of the Nautilus side pane. Keeping the  Backgrounds and Emblems window open (and if you already closed it, open it  again), go to your user’s Home window, click the <b class="calibre13">View</b> menu, and select <b class="calibre13">Side  Pane</b>. The side pane will now appear in the left side of the Nautilus window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can add a different background pattern to the side pane as well, but for  practice let’s add a color instead. To do this, click the <b class="calibre13">Colors</b> button in the  Backgrounds and Emblems window. The window will now be filled with swatches  of color. Drag the <b class="calibre13">Grapefruit</b> swatch to your side pane, and it will turn from gray to, of all things, grapefruit (albeit a very dark and unusually colored grapefruit).  You can also create a two-color-gradation effect by adding yet another color.  Drag the <b class="calibre13">Mango</b> swatch to the bottom of the side pane (but still within the pane)  and you should have a grapefruit-to-mango, top-to-bottom gradation within the  pane. Of course, if you are not pleased with this tropical color set, you can get  back to your original default gray panel by dragging the <b class="calibre13">Reset</b> swatch onto the  area. When you’re done, you can close the Backgrounds and Emblems window.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The side panel of your Nautilus window provides yet a third way to work with  emblems. But before I let you in on this third, and last, way, you will need to add  two more folders to your Home folder. Create one folder and name it “Finances,” which you can use to store files dealing with your relative worth in the  modern scheme of things, and then create another and call it “MyFaves,” where  you can place . . . well, your favorite files. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After you’ve created the new folders, go over to the side pane, click the drop- down menu that says<b class="calibre13"> Information</b>, and select <b class="calibre13">Emblems</b>. A list of emblems will  appear within the side panel (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU54">Figure 5-6</a>). Find the emblem named <b class="calibre13">Money</b>,  and drag it onto your <b class="calibre13">Finances</b> folder. Next, find the<b class="calibre13"> favorite </b>emblem and drag it  onto your <b class="calibre13">MyFaves</b> folder. Once you are done, go back to the drop-down menu  and select <b class="calibre13">Information</b> to get everything back to relative normalcy again.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You’ve seen what your system has available to you, but I am sure that you will  want to use a few background images of your own. Of course, to use your own  images, you first have to get them, so let’s get cracking by downloading one off  the Net. The Internet has plenty of sites with downloadable wallpaper, but for  this project I will point you to one site in particular: <a target="_top" href="http://art.gnome.org">http://art.gnome.org.</a> The  art.gnome site has all the files you’ll need for the steps in this chapter, and lots of  others you can use later, on your own. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Connect to the Internet, if you haven’t already, and then, in your Mozilla  browser, type in the address<span> <a target="_top" href="http://art.gnome.org">http://art.gnome.org</a></span> and press ENTER. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you get there, look for the heading <b class="calibre13">BACKGROUNDS</b> on the left side  of the page, and then click the <b class="calibre13">GNOME</b> link beneath it. Once the backgrounds  list opens, look for a background image of your liking. If you want to use the  same image that I will be using for this particular task, look for the image called  GNOME-Orange. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you find an image, click its thumbnail, which will take you to the information and download page for that file. Download it by right-clicking the link  under the word <b class="calibre13">Resolutions</b> (<b class="calibre13">png-1280x1024</b> in the case of GNOME-Orange)  and then selecting <b class="calibre13">Save Link Target As</b> in the pop-up menu. A Save As window  will pop open, and you can select the folder you would like to download the file  to (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU57">Figure 5-9</a> on the next page). In this case, scroll down in the Save As window to the Thematics folder, double-click to open it, and then click the <b class="calibre13">Save </b>button.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">By the way, you may have noticed that you cannot see the Panel at the bottom of  the screen in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU58">Figure 5-10</a>. This is because the Panel obscured the bottom of the  new wallpaper, which somehow irritated me. I went to the GNOME Panel preferences window by right-clicking an empty space in the Panel and selecting <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> in the pop-up menu. In the Preferences window, I clicked the checkbox  next to the word <b class="calibre13">Autohide</b> and then clicked <b class="calibre13">Close</b>. The autohide function works  just like it does in Windows or Mac OS X — the Panel stays out of view until you move your mouse into the general vicinity of where it should be. You can make  the same change if you like, but that is an aesthetic matter that I will leave up to  you. Ah, the sweet taste of artistic freedom.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now we get to my favorite part of this journey through the world of digital  cosmetic surgery — changing the way window borders and controls look in  GNOME. Let’s set about doing just that.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The procedure is really quite easy. Go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Preferences </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Theme</b>. The Theme Preferences window will open up and show you a list  of the themes that are installed on your system (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU59">Figure 5-11</a>). The default  theme in Fedora Core is called Bluecurve, but, as you can see, there are many  others as well.</p>
<div class="calibre10">

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 5-11: </span> Selecting a theme in GNOME</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get the hang of things, have a look at each of the themes listed by clicking  them one by one. The changes will take effect immediately. Just clicking on a  theme will change your window borders, controls, and even, if you take a peek in  your user’s Home folder, the icons. This is especially noticeable when you click  Crux or Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Each theme consists of a window border, a set of controls, and a collection of  icons. This being the case, it is possible to mix and match these elements on your  own. For example, let’s say that you like the look and color the of bubbly controls in Grand Canyon, but you prefer the window borders in Mist and the icons in  Ocean Dream. Well, you needn’t despair, because you can create a custom  theme consisting of these three different elements. <a name="247" id="247"/><a name="IDX-79" id="IDX-79"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To create your own mix-and-match theme, just click the <b class="calibre13">Theme Details</b> button in  the Theme Preferences window. A new window will open, and you will find three  tabs: Controls, Borders, and Icons. From within each of these tabs you can select  the components you prefer. First click the <b class="calibre13">Controls</b> tab and select <b class="calibre13">Grand Canyon</b>.  Then click the <b class="calibre13">Window Border</b> tab and select <b class="calibre13">Mist</b>. Finally, click the <b class="calibre13">Icons</b> tab  and select <b class="calibre13">Sandy</b>, which is the icon set for the Ocean Dream theme. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now take a look at what you’ve done. Hmm . . . not bad. But, on second  thought, you don’t really like the look of those Mist window borders all that  much. To find something that suits you better, click the <b class="calibre13">Window Border</b> tab  again and scroll down until you see <b class="calibre13">Metabox</b>, and click that. Yes, that’s better.  Now that you are satisfied, you can click the <b class="calibre13">Close</b> button.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will now be back at the Theme Preferences window, where you will  notice that at the top of the list there is a new theme entry called Custom Theme.  If you want to save this combination that you’ve just created for later use, click the <b class="calibre13">Save Theme</b> button. Doing so will open a dialog box in which you can name  your theme and write a brief comment about it. So, name your theme, write a  comment if you like, and then click <b class="calibre13">Save</b>. Your new theme will now appear in  alphabetical order within the theme list under the name you chose. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once that’s all done, your Home folder window should look like that in  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU60">Figure 5-12</a> (and take a look at your Panel and Main menu while you’re at it).  Ah, trés cool!</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you have gotten hot on this customization thing and are not satisfied with the  theme choices included with the system, you can download and install still other  window borders, controls, and icons. To show you how to do this, I will walk you  through creating a faux Mac theme, which will look fairly similar to the standard <a name="250" id="250"/><a name="IDX-80" id="IDX-80"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get the files you’ll need to do this, make another trip to this URL: http:// art.gnome.org. Once there, click the <b class="calibre13">Applications</b> link under the <b class="calibre13">Desktop  Themes</b> heading, and look for a theme called <b class="calibre13">Aquativo</b>. Once you find it, click it  to get to the information and download page. Download it by right-clicking the  filename, <b class="calibre13">GTK2-Aquativo-1.5.tar.gz</b>, and selecting<b class="calibre13"> Save Link Target As</b> in the  pop-up menu. Be sure to download it to your Thematics folder.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will have to download a window border theme too. On the left side of  the art.gnome home page, click the <b class="calibre13">Window Borders</b> link under the <b class="calibre13">Desktop  Themes</b> heading, and, when the page opens, look for a file called<b class="calibre13"> Metativo</b>. Click  the filename, once you find it, and then, from the information and download  page, download it to your Thematics folder by right-clicking the filename,  <b class="calibre13">MCity-Metativo.tar.gz</b>, and selecting <b class="calibre13">Save Link Target As</b> in the pop-up menu. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, you will want to download a new set of icons as well. The icons you  will be downloading are a sort of Mac-meets-Tux collection, which, while not  truly Mac-like in flavor, look pretty cool. Anyway, to download them, just click the  <b class="calibre13">Icon</b> link under the <b class="calibre13">Desktop Themes</b> heading, and then click the link <b class="calibre13">Tux n Tosh 0.2</b> in the new window. Once you arrive at the information and download  page for that file, download it to your Thematics folder by right-clicking the link  for that file, <b class="calibre13">ICON-Tux-n-Tosh-0.1.tar.bz2</b>, and selecting <b class="calibre13">Save Link Target As</b> in  the pop-up menu. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have some new theme files, installing them is a breeze. First, open  your <b class="calibre13">Thematics</b> folder in Nautilus, and then drag the window to the right side of  your screen so that it is readily accessible. Then, open your Theme Preferences  window, if it isn’t still open, and click the <b class="calibre13">Theme Details</b> button, and, in the  Theme Details window, click the <b class="calibre13">Window Border</b> tab. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Instead of using the <b class="calibre13">Install Theme</b> button, simply drag the <b class="calibre13">MCity- Metativo.tar.gz</b> file from your Thematics folder window and drop it into the list of  borders on the left side of the Window Border tab in the Theme Details window. A small window like that in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU61">Figure 5-13</a> on the next page will then open. Just click the <b class="calibre13">Install</b> button in that window, and the theme will then be added to the list of  borders as <b class="calibre13">MetaTivo</b>. Once you see it in the list, you can click on it and the theme  will immediately take effect. </p>

Once again, a  small Install New Theme dialog box will appear, and, as before, just click <b class="calibre13">Install</b>.  The new control set will immediately appear in the controls list as <b class="calibre13">Aquativo-1.5.</b> Click that name in the list, and the changes will immediately take effect. <a name="254" id="254"/><a name="IDX-81" id="IDX-81"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, you need to install the new icon theme. Click the <b class="calibre13">Icons</b> tab in the Theme  Details window, and then drag the file <b class="calibre13">ICON-Tux-n-Tosh-0.1.tar.bz2</b> to the Icons  list in the left side of the Icons tab in the Theme Details window. The Install New  Theme dialog box will appear, and you just need to click <b class="calibre13">Install</b>. Once you’ve  done that, scroll down the Icons list in the Theme Details window, and click on  <b class="calibre13">Tux ’n’ Tosh</b>. The changes will take effect immediately.</p>

The Login Manager is another thing that you can  customize, but you have to have root privileges in order to do so. In addition, any  changes you make will be system-wide, not just for you, so whatever Login  Manager theme you install and choose will be the Login Manager theme that  everyone else using your computer will see when they use the machine.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Used to be that screensavers were a must-have (and must-use) item for computer  users so as to prevent damage (burn-in) to your monitor. Video display  technology, however, has now advanced to the point that screensavers are no  longer necessary. Nevertheless, screensavers are cool to look at, and one very  nice thing about Fedora is that it comes with an unusually extensive collection of  screensaver modules — nearly 200 of them! There are so many that you are sure  to find at least a few you like. The screensaver settings are preconfigured to  switch between modules randomly, changing the current module every few  minutes. You can change these settings by going to your Main menu and  selecting <b class="calibre13">Preferences </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Screensaver</b>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Screensaver Preferences window, shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU63">Figure 5-15</a>, allows you to do  a variety of things, such as set the length of time between module changes and  the length of idle time before the screensaver starts up. You can also opt to use  only one screensaver module or no screensaver at all. In random mode, you can  also omit the modules that you don’t like by unchecking the boxes next to the  undesired modules’ names.</p>

Click the <b class="calibre13">OK</b> button, which will then bring  up a window showing the progress of your download and installation. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After the download is complete, the word <i class="calibre11">success</i> will replace the progress bar.  Click <b class="calibre13">OK</b> to close the window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, select your new theme by going back to the Mozilla <b class="calibre13">View</b> menu and  selecting <b class="calibre13">Apply Themes </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Skypilot Classic</b>. Quit Mozilla and then run it again,  and you should see the new theme (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU66">Figure 5-18</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can, of course, download and install other themes in the same manner from  either site. Just be sure to download versions that are appropriate for your  browser, though both sites should automatically direct you to the correct version. You can find out what version of Mozilla you are running by going to the <b class="calibre13">Help </b>menu in Mozilla and selecting <b class="calibre13">About Mozilla</b>.</p>
