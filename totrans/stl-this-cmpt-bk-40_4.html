</span></span></div></div><p>When most people think of Internet crime, they picture hackers stealing credit card numbers and racking up huge charges for somebody else to pay. Although this can and does occur, the biggest threat on the Internet isn't hackers, it's con artists, many of whom are no more competent at using a computer than the people they're victimizing.</p><p>Whether con artists are fleecing a victim in person, through the mail, over the telephone, or over the Internet, all follow the same basic approach:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Promise a fantastic reward in return for little or no effort. (Victims are usually too blinded by their own greed to question why the con artist would want to help them in the first place.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Exploit the victim's trust. (Con artists encourage victims to demonstrate their trust in order to show they deserve the promised reward.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Collect the victim's money. (Con artists must trick a victim into giving up money or something equally valuable.)</p></li></ol></div><p>Not surprisingly, con artists and politicians often use identical tactics. Politicians always promise that they're serving the voters' interests without revealing their own motives (Step 1). Then they appeal to the voters' trust by implying that they'll benefit if the particular politician is elected to office (Step 2). Finally, the politician appeals for the voters' support (Step 3), which leads to power and money for the politician. In the case of usual politics, the money goes toward promoting the politician's reelection and other political maneuvers. In the case of a crooked politician, the voters get conned and left with nothing.</p><p>Because nearly everyone would love to make a lot of money without doing any work, all of us are potential victims of con games. To avoid falling prey to an Internet scam, take some time to educate yourself on the different types of cons that have been duping people for years.</p><div class="sect1" title="Charity Scams"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="charity_scams"/>Charity Scams</h1></div></div></div><p>Every time there's a disaster anywhere in the world, con artists try to take advantage of people's generosity. These charity scams often involve fake charity websites with legitimate-sounding names that accept online payments, such as transactions made through PayPal. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for example, website names that were not affiliated with any legitimate charities included <a class="ulink" href="http://www.katrinareliefonline.org">www.katrinareliefonline.org</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.katrinahelp.com">www.katrinahelp.com</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.katrinadfamilies.com">www.katrinadfamilies.com</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Phony charity websites can attract people who want to donate money, but con artists often go one step further and actively solicit donations through spam. Such unsolicited email will often mention the name of a fake charity that's very similar to a legitimate one, such as the National Cancer Society (instead of the legitimate American Cancer Society) or the National Heart Institute (instead of the legitimate American Heart Institute).</p><p>These con artists can scam you in two ways. First, if you donate money, you'll be giving your cash to a con artist instead of to a charity. Second, if you give the con artist your credit card number, you'll risk having him run up huge charges.</p><p>To avoid charity scams, never donate money to any organization that sends unsolicited email, and never provide your information to a telemarketer seeking donations over the phone. Because blanket telemarketing is expensive and time-consuming, few legitimate charities rely on it to raise money. A legitimate organization will provide a website or mailing address if you ask, and making this your standard procedure will ensure that you have the time and ability to investigate the charity. Before you make any donations, check out the charity's name. Bogus websites often create logos that look similar to those of legitimate charities. A simple search using Google or on the Better Business Bureau website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bbb.com">www.bbb.com</a>) will uncover well-known frauds. You can often tell a fake charity from a legitimate one by doing a WHOIS search (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.networksolutions.com/whois">www.networksolutions.com/whois</a>) on the domain name. If the WHOIS search reveals that the owner of the domain name is the charity you expected, such as the American Red Cross for the redcross.org domain name, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#a_whois_search_can_reveal_the_true_owner" title="Figure 13-1. A WHOIS search can reveal the true owner behind charity domain names.">Figure 13-1</a>, then the website is most likely legitimate. If the WHOIS search reveals an individual or an organization other than the charity promoted by the website, you might want to investigate the charity more closely before sending any money.</p><p>Even legitimate charities themselves can fall prey to con artists. The former chief executive of the United Way once pled guilty to stealing $500,000 from the charity, channeling donations into his own pockets instead of toward the worthy causes they were meant to support. So even if you give to a legitimate charitable organization, it's possible that your money will not help someone who actually needs it.</p><p>If you really want to help others, do the research to find a reputable charity. When you give to that charity, use the methods you've researched and verified (by clicking on a secure online link, sending your check to a mail address, or by calling a phone number). Better yet, donate your time by volunteering. That way you can be sure your money isn't being wasted. For more on giving money to charities, visit the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.give.org">www.give.org</a>. To research and learn about different (valid) charities, visit Charity Search (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.charitynavigator.org">www.charitynavigator.org</a>). If you suspect that a charity could be fraudulent or dishonest, visit Google and search for the charity name along with words like <span class="emphasis"><em>scandal</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>scam</em></span> to find information from people who might have been conned by that particular charity.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_whois_search_can_reveal_the_true_owner"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9133"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676611.png.jpg" alt="A WHOIS search can reveal the true owner behind charity domain names."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-1. A WHOIS search can reveal the true owner behind charity domain names.</p></div><p>Even if you find a valid charity, be careful of their privacy policies. To earn additional income, some charities may sell your name, address, and email address to market research firms, which means you could donate money for a good cause and then wind up getting junk mail and spam in return for your effort.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0007" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Area Code Scam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_area_code_scam"/>The Area Code Scam</h1></div></div></div><p>Some scams leverage the proliferation of newly created telephone area codes. The con artist starts by leaving a phone message or by sending an email claiming that you've won a fabulous prize in a contest, or that your credit card was incorrectly charged, or that one of your relatives is in trouble—anything to prompt you to return the call or respond to the email.</p><p>If you call the phone number provided in the message, you may be placed on hold, directed to a long-winded recorded message, or put in touch with someone who speaks broken English. In any event, the person on the other end simply tries to keep you on the phone as long as possible because (surprise!) the phone number is really a pay-per-call service (much like a 1-900 number) that charges you (the caller) astronomical rates, which can amount to as much as $25 per minute.</p><p>The area code most commonly used in this scam is 809, which is actually located in the Caribbean. Thus, the scammer can avoid American laws, such as those requiring that he warn you in advance of the charges being incurred and state the per-minute rate involved, or that there must be a provision for terminating the call within a certain time period without being charged. However, because no international code is required to reach the phone number, most people won't even realize that they're making an international call.</p><p>Area code scams are extremely hard to prosecute. The victim actually initiates the call, so neither the local phone company nor the long distance carrier is likely to be of any assistance or to cancel the charges.</p><p>To avoid this scam, be careful when returning unknown phone calls with unfamiliar area codes. As more people are learning about the 809 scam, con artists have switched to other area codes such as 242 (the Bahamas), 284 (British Virgin Islands), and 787 (Puerto Rico), as well as 500 and 700 prefixes, which are commonly used for pay-per-call adult entertainment services.</p><p>If in doubt, check an area code's location first by visiting the LincMad website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.lincmad.com">www.lincmad.com</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0008" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Nigerian Scam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_nigerian_scam"/>The Nigerian Scam</h1></div></div></div><p>Many people in other countries hate Americans, which isn't surprising when you realize that many foreigners know the United States only through the actions of stereotypical "ugly" American tourists and American politicians (many of whom are disliked in their own country, too).</p><p>People in other countries get most of their information about Americans from American television shows. After watching shows like <span class="emphasis"><em>Sex and the City</em></span>, lots of people in other countries believe that Americans are not only rich and beautiful, but lousy actors as well.</p><p>Regardless of the foreign perception of Americans, the fact remains that the United States is one of the wealthiest countries on the planet. Given the wide disparity between the average American's income and that of people in other countries, for many people there's not much guilt or shame in conning Americans out of their money at every available opportunity.</p><p>Not only have many scams originated in Nigeria, but the Nigerian government itself has been involved to the point that many believe that international scams are the country's third largest industry. The general view in Nigeria is that if you can cheat an American out of his money, it's the American's fault for being gullible in the first place.</p><p>Nigerian scams are often called "Advance Fee Fraud," "419 Fraud" (four-one-nine, after the relevant section of the Criminal Code of Nigeria), or "The Fax Scam." The scam works as follows: The victim receives an unsolicited email message, fax, or letter from Nigeria containing a money-laundering proposal disguised as a seemingly legitimate business plan involving crude oil or as a notice about a bequest left in a will.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The fax or letter usually asks the victim to facilitate transfer of a large sum of money to the victim's own bank and promises that he will receive a share if he pays an "advance fee," "transfer tax," "performance bond," or government bribe of some sort. If the victim pays the fee, complications mysteriously arise that require the victim to send more money until he runs out of money, patience, or both.</p><p>With the growing popularity of the Internet, Nigerian con artists have been very busy. Don't be surprised if you receive email from Nigeria asking for your help. The following is an example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Dear Sir</p><p>I am working with the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria. It happens that five months ago my father who was the Chairman of the Task Force Committee created by the present Military Government to monitor the selling, distribution and revenue generation from crude oil sales before and after the gulf war crisis died in a motor accident on his way home from Lagos after attending a National conference. He was admitted in the hospital for eight (8) days before he finally died. While I was with him in the hospital, he disclosed all his confidential documents to me one of which is the business I want to introduce to you right now.</p><p>Before my father finally died in the hospital, he told me that he has $21.5M (twenty one million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) cash in a trunk box coded and deposited in a security company. He told me that the security company is not aware of its contents. That on producing a document which, he gave to me, that I will only pay for the demurrage after which the box will be released to me.</p><p>He further advised me that I should not collect the money without the assistance of a foreigner who will open a local account in favor of his company for onward transfer to his nominated overseas account where the money will be invested.</p><p>This is because as a civil servant I am not supposed to own such money. This will bring many questions in the bank if I go without a foreigner.</p><p>It is at this juncture that I decided to contact you for assistance but with the following conditions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>That this transaction is treated with Utmost confidence, cooperation and absolute secrecy which it demands.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>That the money is being transferred to an account where the incidence of taxation would not take much toll.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>That all financial matters for the success of this transfer will be tackled by both parties.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>That a promissory letter signed and sealed by you stating the amount US $21.5M (twenty-one million five hundred thousand US Dollars) will be given to me by you on your account and that only 20% of the total money is for your assistance.</p></li></ol></div><p>Please contact me on the above fax number for more details. Please quote (QS) in all your correspondence.</p><p>Yours faithfully,</p><p>DR. AN UZOAMAKA</p></blockquote></div><p>To learn more about scams originating in Nigeria, visit the 419 Coalition website (<a class="ulink" href="http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal">http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal</a>). If you're foolish enough to send money to the con artist running this scam, you'll most likely receive a subsequent email saying that there were additional delays or problems, such as unforeseen fees, fines, or bribes that need to be paid. The goal is to keep you sending money for as long as possible. In some cases, people have sent thousands of dollars to these con artists while others have actually traveled to Nigeria to meet with the con artists in person. In 2003, a 72-year-old man in the Czech Republic lost his life savings to a Nigerian con artist and took his frustration out by shooting a Nigerian diplomat.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since the United States sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001, a new variation on the Nigerian scam has emerged. In this adaptation, potential victims receive an email supposedly from an American soldier who has discovered a large stash of money and needs help sneaking it back to the United States. Other than using the name of an American soldier instead of a Nigerian official, the scam is the same.</p><p>Similar to the Nigerian scam is the advance loan scam, which promises to loan you money at an extremely low interest rate. All you have to do is pay an advance fee for "processing." Once the con artist receives your money, complications mysteriously occur. You never get the loan you expected, and the con artist walks away with your advance fee.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Work-at-Home Businesses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="work-at-home_businesses"/>Work-at-Home Businesses</h1></div></div></div><p>Another common scam often promoted in unsolicited email promises fabulous moneymaking opportunities that can be achieved at home with little effort. This type of scam is not new. Con artists originally perpetrated these scams using post office boxes and letters; today's scam artists use the reach of the Internet and the simplicity of email to reach more potential victims faster than ever before. This should give you yet another reason to avoid receiving, let alone reading, any unsolicited email (see <a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. Identity Theft and Spam">Chapter 18</a> for more information about spam). This section lists some typical examples of these scams.</p><div class="sect2" title="Stuffing envelopes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="stuffing_envelopes"/>Stuffing envelopes</h2></div></div></div><p>The most common work-at-home business scam claims that you can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars stuffing envelopes in your spare time.</p><p>First of all, who in his right mind would want to spend his life stuffing envelopes? If this prospect actually appeals to you and you send money for more information, you need to seriously examine your aspirations in life. If you send money, you'll probably receive the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A letter stating that, if you want to make money, you should just place your own ad in a magazine or newspaper offering to sell information to others about how they can make money by stuffing envelopes. There's no envelope-stuffing involved at all.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Information about contacting mail-order companies and offering to stuff their envelopes for them. Unfortunately, you'll soon find that stuffing envelopes pays less than Third World wages.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Make-it-yourself kits"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="make-it-yourself_kits"/>Make-it-yourself kits</h2></div></div></div><p>Another work-at-home business scam offers to sell you a kit (such as a greeting card kit). You're supposed to follow the kit's instructions to make custom greeting cards, Christmas wreaths, flyers, or other products and then sell the products yourself as a quick way to start your own business. The business may sound legitimate, but the kit is usually worthless, and always overpriced, and the products that it claims you can sell will rarely earn you enough to recoup the cost of your original investment.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Work as an independent contractor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="work_as_an_independent_contractor"/>Work as an independent contractor</h2></div></div></div><p>Rather than start your own business making products from do-it-yourself kits, why not work as an independent contractor for a company that will take care of the hassles of marketing and selling for you? This scam claims that a company is willing to pay thousands of dollars a month to have you help it build something, like toy dolls or baby shoes. All you have to do is manufacture these items at home and sell them to the company.</p><p>If you're foolish enough to send money, you'll receive instructions and materials to build whatever product you're supposed to make. However, the materials are often cheap and easily obtainable for a fraction of the price at your local stores.</p><p>What usually happens is that the work is so boring that most people give up before they even get to the point of selling one batch of the product (often there is a high minimum purchase amount listed in the instructions). For those with greater perseverance, the company will often claim that the workmanship is of poor quality (whether it is or not) and thus refuse to pay you for your work. Either way, someone else now has your money.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Fraudulent sales"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fraudulent_sales"/>Fraudulent sales</h2></div></div></div><p>People have been fooled into buying shoddy or nonexistent products for years. The Internet just provides one more avenue for con artists to peddle their snake oil. Scammers can reach a mass audience by spamming thousands of email addresses every day. Two popular types of fraudulent sales involve "miracle" health products and investments.</p><p>Miracle health products have been around for centuries, claiming to cure everything from impotence and indigestion to AIDS and cancer. Of course, if you buy one of these products, your malady doesn't get any better—and may actually get worse. In the meantime, you're stuck with a worthless product that may consist of nothing more than corn syrup and food coloring.</p><p>Investment swindles are nothing new either. The typical stock swindler dangles the promise of large profits and low risk, but only if you act right away (so the con artist can get your money sooner and keep you from researching the "bait," only to realize its true nature as a scam). Many stock swindlers visit investment forums or chat rooms, such as those on America Online, and scout these areas for people willing to believe their promises of "ground-floor" opportunities and to hand over money to complete strangers.</p><p>Like worthless miracle health products, investment scams may sell you stock certificates or bonds that have no real value whatsoever. Typically these investments focus on gold mines, oil wells, real estate, ostrich farms, or other exotic investments that seem exciting and interesting but prove to be nonexistent or worthless.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Pyramid Schemes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pyramid_schemes"/>Pyramid Schemes</h1></div></div></div><p>The idea behind a pyramid scheme is to get two or more people to give you money. In exchange, you give them nothing but the hope that they can get rich too—as long as they can convince two or more people to give them money, and so on. The most common incarnation of a pyramid scheme is a chain letter.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A typical chain letter lists five addresses and urges you to send money (one dollar or more) to each of them. It instructs you to copy the chain letter, removing the top name from the list of addresses and putting your own name and address at the bottom, and mail five copies of the chain letter to other people. The promise in the letter is that if you send the five dollars (or more), you can just sit back and wait for fabulous riches to come pouring into your mailbox within a few weeks—one dollar at a time. (Those who want to con others out of money probably realize that it's faster to simply start a new chain letter with their name at the top.)</p><p>Many chain letters require you to sign a letter agreeing that you are offering the money as a gift or that you are buying the five addresses as a mailing list. In this way, the chain letter author says, you will not be breaking any laws.</p><p>Most people receive chain letters as unsolicited email, but a unique twist on the chain letter scam, called Mega$Nets, appeared in the early '90s. Unlike a text-only chain letter, Mega$Nets was a computer program that let people type in their name and address using a specially generated code, which users could buy and then offer to sell to others.</p><p>Mega$Nets claimed that it wasn't a chain letter because people were paying for its software (which was actually just an electronic version of a chain letter). Mega$Nets was spread by people posting copies on personal websites where others could download it and join this "incredible money-making opportunity."</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="pyramid_schemes-id1"/><p class="title"/><p>After receiving a copy of Mega$Nets in the mid-'90s, I spent an afternoon dissecting the program and discovered that it wouldn't run unless it included the VBRUN300.DLL file, which meant that the program had been written in Visual Basic 3.0. Next, I used a Visual Basic disassembler to convert the program from an executable file back to its original Visual Basic source code, so I could see how it stored names and addresses and generated its "secret codes." Then, I wrote another Visual Basic 3.0 program, dubbed Mega$Hack, that allowed users to edit any names and addresses stored in the Mega$Nets program and generate their own "secret codes" without paying a penny. By releasing the Mega$Hack program into the public domain and allowing skeptics to modify Mega$Nets for free, I hoped to foul up the Mega$Nets scam and highlight the foolishness of paying for a "secret code" to join a chain letter. This was my small contribution to battle against con artists, and to make the Internet a safer place for everyone.</p></div><p>Multilevel marketing (MLM) business opportunities are similar to chain letters. Valid MLM businesses offer two ways to make money: by selling a product or by recruiting new distributors. Most people who get rich within an MLM business do so by recruiting new distributors. Unfortunately, many scams masquerade as legitimate MLM businesses with the key difference that you can make money <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> by recruiting others; the only product being sold is a nebulous "business opportunity."<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Pyramid schemes often make a few people very wealthy, but at the expense of nearly everyone else at the bottom of the pyramid. Nowadays, those running pyramid schemes can recruit new members through Usenet newsgroups or by spamming multiple email accounts (see <a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. Identity Theft and Spam">Chapter 18</a>). Once you realize that pyramid schemes need your money to make other people rich, you won't be taken in by the offers that come your way, no matter how tempting.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Ponzi scheme"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_ponzi_scheme"/>The Ponzi scheme</h2></div></div></div><p>Among the oldest and most common investment scams is a variation on the pyramid scheme known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ponzi scheme</em></span>, named after post–World War I financier Charles Ponzi, who used money from new investors to pay off early investors. Because the early investors received tremendous returns on their investments, they quickly spread the news that Charles Ponzi was an investment genius. New investors rushed forward with wads of cash, hoping to get rich too, at which point Charles Ponzi took the money and ran.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Social Security is basically a Ponzi scheme, because it pays current recipients out of current investors' funds. This requires more people to pay into the system all the time, which explains why it's perpetually in danger of going bankrupt.</p></div><p>Con artists are now running Ponzi schemes over the Internet through email, faxes, or websites offering "Incredible investment opportunities!" In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused the owners of <a class="ulink" href="http://12dailypro.com">12dailypro.com</a> of running an Internet Ponzi scheme that bilked "investors" out of more than $50 million. These would-be investors were allegedly promised a 44 percent return on their investments in 12 days. After purchasing "units" at $6 apiece, investors would get paid to look at advertisements on the Internet. The money supposedly came from the advertisers, but the SEC claims the money really came from other so-called investors.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0019" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Any time anyone promises you unbelievably high returns in an extremely short period of time, chances are good they're offering you a Ponzi scheme, and if you take the bait, you can kiss your money good-bye.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The infallible forecaster"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_infallible_forecaster"/>The infallible forecaster</h2></div></div></div><p>Any time you receive a letter or email from a stranger who says he wishes to help you for no apparent reason, watch out. Many con games start by offering a victim something for nothing, which plays to the victim's inevitable greed (proving the adage "You can't cheat an honest man").</p><p>In the "infallible forecaster" investment scam, a "broker" visits an investment chat room or forum and sends an email to everyone he finds there, offering an investment prediction at no charge whatsoever. The email says the purpose of the offer is simply to demonstrate the broker's skill at forecasting the market. The free forecast will tell you to watch a particular stock or commodity, and sure enough, the price will go up, just as he said it would.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0020" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Soon you'll get another message from the same broker, containing the prediction that a stock price or commodity is about to drop. Once again, he just wants to convince you of his infallible forecasting abilities—and once again, the price will do exactly what was predicted.</p><p>After that, you'll receive a message with a third prediction, but this time you'll have a chance to invest. Because the broker's previous two predictions seemed accurate, many people will jump at this shot at a sure thing. Then the broker takes his victims' money and disappears.</p><p>Here's what really happened. For the first mass-emailing campaign, the broker contacted 100 people. In half of those letters, he claimed a stock or commodity price would go up; in the other half, he claimed that the price would go down. No matter what the market does, 50 people will probably believe that the broker accurately predicted it.</p><p>With these 50 people, the broker repeats the process, telling 25 of these people that a price will go up and 25 of them that the price will go down. Once more, half of the scammer's potential victims will receive an accurate forecast.</p><p>So now the con artist has 25 people (out of the original 100) who've seen evidence that he can accurately predict the market. They send the broker their money—and never hear from him again.</p><p>The next time you visit an investment-related chat room, newsgroup, or website, remember that you will likely become a target for the con artists who specialize in these kinds of investment scams. So, be careful, keep your money to yourself, and warn others of investment scams. Be vigilant about applying common sense to every offer, and you should be all right.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Lonely Hearts Scam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_lonely_hearts_scam"/>The Lonely Hearts Scam</h1></div></div></div><p>The lonely hearts scam involves fleecing a rich victim with the promise of love and affection. In the old days, the con artist had to meet and talk with the potential victim in person, but nowadays, con artists can use the Internet to work their magic from afar.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0022" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The con artist contacts potential victims and claims to be a beautiful woman currently living in another country such as Russia or the Philippines. After sending a photograph (usually of someone else), the con artist steadily gains the trust and confidence of the victim through emails, faxes, or letters.</p><p>When the con artist believes he has gained the victim's trust, he makes a simple request for money to get a visa, so the foreign pen pal can travel to meet the victim—purportedly to live together happily ever after. If the victim sends money, complications inevitably arise requiring more money for bribes or additional fees, as in the Nigerian scam.</p><p>Sometimes the victim realizes he's been fleeced and stops sending money, but other times the victim honestly believes that the con artist is a beautiful woman trying to get out of her country. The longer the con artist can maintain this illusion, the more money he can fleece from the victim.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Internet-Specific Con Games"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="internet-specific_con_games"/>Internet-Specific Con Games</h1></div></div></div><p>Many con games have been around for years, but others are brand new, created in the wake of the development of the Internet. The primary con game on the Internet involves stealing credit card numbers. Con artists have several ways of doing this: packet sniffing, web spoofing, phishing, using keystroke loggers, and using porn dialers. (Some of these methods have been covered in previous chapters.)<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Packet sniffers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="packet_sniffers"/>Packet sniffers</h2></div></div></div><p>When you send anything over the Internet (such as your name, phone number, or credit card number), the information doesn't go directly from your computer to the website you're viewing. Instead, the Internet breaks this information into packets of information and routes it from one computer to another, like a bucket brigade, until it reaches the computer hosting the website you're sending the information to.</p><p>Packet sniffers work by intercepting these packets of information. Typically, a hacker will plant a packet sniffer on a computer hosting a shopping website. The majority of packets intercepted on that host computer will contain credit card numbers or other information a thief might find useful.</p><p>The packet sniffer copies the credit card number before sending it to its final destination. Consequently, you may not know your credit card number has been stolen until you find unusual charges on your bill.</p><p>To help protect yourself against packet sniffers, only type your credit card number into a website that uses encryption (a tiny lock icon appears on the screen, usually at the bottom right, when you're connected to an online shopping site that uses encryption).</p><p>Despite current public perception, the Internet isn't the easiest vehicle for stealing a credit card number. When you use your credit card in a restaurant, the waiter could copy down the number for his own personal use later. That's much easier than the time and trouble it takes to install a packet sniffer. A bigger threat to your credit card actually occurs when a company stores it on its (usually insecure) computer. Hackers can break into that computer and steal all the credit card information stored there, including yours, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>In 2005, intruders broke into the network of CardSystems Solutions, a company that processed credit card orders for MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express. The hackers copied the records of more than 200,000 credit card holders. That same year, scammers hoodwinked ChoicePoint, a company that provides consumer data to insurance companies and government agencies, and stole more than 110,000 records containing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit reports. Even Stanford University fell victim to a hacker who broke into the school's computers and took more than 10,000 records containing names and Social Security numbers. No matter how safe your computer may be, your data stored elsewhere will always be at the mercy of others' computer security.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Web spoofing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="web_spoofing"/>Web spoofing</h2></div></div></div><p>Web spoofing is similar to packet sniffing, but involves setting up a website that masquerades as a legitimate site. To attract victims, con artists may rely on common misspellings of a URL address. For example, someone trying to visit Microsoft's website at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> might type <a class="ulink" href="http://www.micrsoft.com">www.micrsoft.com</a> by mistake and access what appears to be the legitimate site they wanted. But any credit card number sent to this site goes directly to the con artist.</p><p>To prevent yourself from falling victim to web spoofing, always verify the correct spelling of a URL address in your browser window. To play it safe, rather than type a URL address yourself, visit a search engine to find the website you want, such as Microsoft or eBay, and follow the link displayed in the search results. Bookmark commonly used pages so that they don't have to be typed often.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0025" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Phishing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phishing"/>Phishing</h2></div></div></div><p>Rather than wait for someone to mistype a URL address, however, most con artists actively phish for victims by sending out bogus emails claiming to be from a bank, eBay, PayPal, or other legitimate organization, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch13s07.html#phishers_send_out_mass_emails_like_this" title="Figure 13-2. Phishers send out mass emails like this one, claiming to be from legitimate businesses and telling recipients to click a link and enter personal information.">Figure 13-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="phishers_send_out_mass_emails_like_this"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9462"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676613.png" alt="Phishers send out mass emails like this one, claiming to be from legitimate businesses and telling recipients to click a link and enter personal information."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-2. Phishers send out mass emails like this one, claiming to be from legitimate businesses and telling recipients to click a link and enter personal information.</p></div><p>The tone and content of phishing emails are always the same. First, they warn that users must update their account by typing in some valuable information, often a credit card number. To lend a sense of urgency, the email also threatens that the account could be suspended if action isn't taken. Finally, the email provides a convenient link that leads to a seemingly legitimate web page where the victim can type in his credit card number. Victims enter their credit card numbers and unknowingly give that information to a con artist.</p><p>To prevent yourself from falling victim to web spoofing, always verify the correct spelling of a URL address in your browser window. To play it safe, rather than type a URL address yourself, visit a search engine and find the website you want, such as Microsoft or eBay, and follow the link displayed in the search results.</p><p>Even then you can't always be sure that you're visiting a valid website. Many phishers now take advantage of the way browsers interpret international characters such as the ă or ğ characters in something known as the International Domain Name (IDN) vulnerability.</p><p>Phishers simply create a fake website that mimics a real one, such as PayPal's site. Then they give this fake website the domain name identical to the real one, except they substitute international characters, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.păypăl.com">www.păypăl.com</a>. When victims visit this site, the browser can't display the international characters, so the address appears with the international characters stripped away, as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.paypal.com">www.paypal.com</a>. Ironically, the only browser immune to this type of spoofing is Internet Explorer, simply because Microsoft never bothered to update their browser to handle International Domain Names.</p><p>You can often recognize phishing emails by misspellings in the text, as seen in the words <span class="emphasis"><em>attion</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>non existant</em></span> in the phishing email in <a class="xref" href="ch13s07.html#phishers_send_out_mass_emails_like_this" title="Figure 13-2. Phishers send out mass emails like this one, claiming to be from legitimate businesses and telling recipients to click a link and enter personal information.">Figure 13-2</a>. Another way to recognize a spoofed website is by examining the link provided in the email. If you move your mouse pointer over the link, your browser will display the actual URL address to which the link points. As shown in <a class="xref" href="ch13s07.html#your_browser_can_display_the_actual_url" title="Figure 13-3. Your browser can display the actual URL address of a link for you to examine.">Figure 13-3</a>, spoofed websites typically embed the name of the company (such as PayPal) in the URL address along with words such as <span class="emphasis"><em>signin</em></span> to create the illusion of legitimacy. However, the legitimate business's domain is not the actual domain of these phishing sites, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://paypal.signin0794.com">http://paypal.signin0794.com</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="your_browser_can_display_the_actual_url"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9502"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676615.png.jpg" alt="Your browser can display the actual URL address of a link for you to examine."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-3. Your browser can display the actual URL address of a link for you to examine.</p></div><p>If a URL address contains a bunch of letters and numbers that don't seem to make any sense, chances are good it's taking you to a con artist's website.</p><p>Since most experienced computer users have received numerous phishing messages purporting to be from PayPal or eBay, it's getting harder and harder to scam people this way. So, phishers are getting more selective about whom they target, a tactic known as <span class="emphasis"><em>spear phishing</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0026" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Unlike ordinary phishers, who indiscriminately send out messages claiming to be from organizations such as PayPal or a national bank, spear phishers send their messages to a select group of individuals, typically those working for a large company such as General Motors or a government organization such as the Department of Agriculture. The messages appear to come from an existing group or department within that organization, asking for a user name or password to gain access to the corporate network. Because the bogus email appears to come from another company department, people are more likely to respond and get conned.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0028" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To learn more about phishing, visit the Anti-Phishing Working Group (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.antiphishing.org">www.antiphishing.org</a>). To avoid falling victim to the latest phishing scam, grab a copy of PhishGuard (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.phishguard.com">www.phishguard.com</a>), which contains a database of bogus website addresses that phishers use to mimic other companies' websites, such as CitiBank or eBay. The moment PhishGuard detects that you're visiting a phishing site, it alerts you. PhishGuard stays up-to-date and effective by having users submit the latest sites to its database.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Keystroke loggers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keystroke_loggers"/>Keystroke loggers</h2></div></div></div><p>A keystroke logger is special software or hardware that records a user's keystrokes, such as the characters a person uses to enter a password or credit card number. Software keystroke loggers run like other programs, except they hide in memory. Hardware keystroke loggers connect between the computer and the keyboard. Visit KeyGhost (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.keyghost.com">www.keyghost.com</a>) to view examples of different hardware-based keystroke loggers, including one disguised as a normal keyboard, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch13s07.html#your_keyboard_could_be_spying_on_you_and" title="Figure 13-4. Your keyboard could be spying on you and recording all of your keystrokes.">Figure 13-4</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0029" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="your_keyboard_could_be_spying_on_you_and"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9550"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676617.png.jpg" alt="Your keyboard could be spying on you and recording all of your keystrokes."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-4. Your keyboard could be spying on you and recording all of your keystrokes.</p></div><p>If a hacker doesn't have physical access to your computer, he can still install a keystroke logger by using a remote-access Trojan horse or RAT (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Trojan Horses and Worms">Chapter 5</a>). The con artist simply contacts potential victims through email or chat rooms and convinces them to download and run the Trojan horse, which opens a port and contacts the hacker. Then the hacker can read any files on the victim's computer or watch the keystrokes the victim types without his knowledge.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-0033" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To protect yourself against keystroke loggers, buy a program such as SpyCop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.spycop.com">www.spycop.com</a>) or Who's Watching Me? (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.trapware.com">www.trapware.com</a>). These programs will scan your computer for signs of keystroke loggers and root them out.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Porn dialers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="porn_dialers"/>Porn dialers</h2></div></div></div><p>Porn dialers won't steal your credit card number. Instead, they use another method to empty victims' bank accounts. Porn dialers get their name from the fact that they often claim to be free programs that grant access to pornographic websites.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0034" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Once you download this "free" program, it takes control of your telephone modem, turns off your computer's speakers, cuts off your local Internet connection, and then secretly dials a long-distance number to connect you to another Internet service provider (ISP), typically located in a faraway land, such as Africa or Eastern Europe.</p><p>As far as the victim can tell, the program does exactly what it claimed; it provides access to free pornography. What the victim doesn't know is that his Internet connection is now on a long-distance phone call to a place halfway across the world. The longer the victim views the pornographic files, the longer he stays connected to this foreign Internet service provider, which may ring up toll charges of several dollars a minute. The customers don't realize they've been scammed until they receive their phone bills. Because the calls were initiated from the victim's end, it's difficult to get the charges removed from the phone bill.</p><p>Although porn dialers won't work if the victim connects to the Internet using a cable or DSL modem, they can fool anyone still using a phone modem with a dial-up connection. If you have an external modem, watch the status lights to make sure your modem doesn't disconnect and then mysteriously reconnect all by itself. If you have an internal modem, your only defense generally is to be careful if a website lures you into downloading "free" software with pornography. (Besides, you should already be suspicious of anyone offering you something for free when you haven't even asked for it.) If the phone line is used only for the computer, you may be able to remove all long-distance and pay-per-call access by requesting this from the phone company. That option must be implemented before charges show up, however.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Online Auction Frauds"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="online_auction_frauds"/>Online Auction Frauds</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the more recent crazes on the Internet is online auctions where people can offer junk, antiques, or collector's items for sale to anyone who wants to bid on them. Millions of people visit online auction websites (such as eBay), making them a tempting target for con artists. Sellers often have to deal with fraudulent bids from people who have no money or intention of buying. Buyers have to watch out for con artists selling fraudulent or nonexistent items.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0035" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The simplest con game is to offer an item for auction that doesn't even exist. For example, every Christmas there is a must-have toy that normally costs about $10 to purchase, but because of its scarcity in stores, it can cost up to several thousand dollars when purchased from a private seller. Many con artists will claim to offer such a product, and then disappear once they've got their victims' money.</p><p>Misrepresentation is another common online auction fraud. Con artists may sell counterfeit collector's items such as autographed baseballs or sports jerseys. To protect yourself against online auction fraud, follow these guidelines:<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0036" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Identify the seller and check the seller's rating. Online auction sites such as eBay allow buyers and sellers to leave comments about one another. By browsing through these comments, you can see if anyone else has had a bad experience with a particular seller.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check to see if your online auction site offers insurance. eBay will reimburse buyers up to $200, less a $25 deductible.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure you clearly understand what you're bidding on, its relative value, and all terms and conditions of the sale, such as the seller's return policies and who pays for shipping.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Consider using an escrow service, which will hold your money until your merchandise arrives safely.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Never buy items advertised through spam. Con artists use spam because they know that the more email offers they send out, the more likely they'll run across a gullible victim. If someone's selling a legitimate item, he's more likely to go through an online auction site.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Scambusters website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.scambusters.org/Scambusters31.html">www.scambusters.org/Scambusters31.html</a>) offers additional sage advice:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Don't conduct business with an anonymous user. Get the person's real name, business name (if applicable), address, and phone number. Verify this information before buying. Never send money to a post office box.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Be more cautious if the seller uses a free email service, such as Hotmail or Yahoo!. Of course, many people who use these services are honest, but Hotmail and its ilk also make it very easy for the seller to keep his or her real identity and information hidden.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Always use a credit card (not a debit card, cash, or money order) for online purchases. If there's any dispute, you can have the credit card company remove the charges or help you fight for your product.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0037" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Save copies of any email correspondence and other documents involved in the transaction.</p></li></ul></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Credit Card Fraud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="credit_card_fraud"/>Credit Card Fraud</h1></div></div></div><p>Credit card fraud is actually a bigger headache for merchants than it is for customers. If a thief steals someone's credit card and orders thousands of dollars worth of merchandise, the merchant pays for the loss, not the owner of the stolen credit card.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-0038" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So if you're a merchant, be extra careful when accepting credit card orders. To help protect your business, follow these guidelines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Validate the full name, address, and phone number for every order. Be especially vigilant with orders that list different "bill to" and "ship to" addresses.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Watch out for any orders that come from free email accounts (<a class="ulink" href="http://hotmail.com">hotmail.com</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://juno.com">juno.com</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://usa.net">usa.net</a>, etc.), which are easy to set up with phony identities. When accepting an order from a free email account, request additional information before processing the order, such as an alternate email address, the name and phone number of the bank that issued the credit card, the exact name on the credit card, and the exact billing address. Most credit card thieves will avoid such requests for additional information and look for a less vigilant merchant to con.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Be especially careful of extremely large orders that request next-day delivery. Thieves usually want their merchandise as quickly as possible—before they're discovered—and don't mind adding a bit to the overall charge, which they aren't planning to pay anyway.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Likewise, be careful when shipping products to an international address. Validate as much information as possible by email or, preferably, by phone.</p></li></ul></div><p>For more information about protecting yourself from credit card fraud and other online thievery, visit the AntiFraud website at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.antifraud.com">www.antifraud.com</a>.</p></div>

You can't shove other people out of the way to get to the front of a line or tell your boss what you really think of him because you'll have to face the consequences of your actions. On the Internet, nobody knows who you are or even where you are unless you tell them. (Or unless they track down your IP address and trace your name and street address through your ISP.)</p><p>There's a sense of distance and anonymity that frees people to drop any social pretense and act upon whatever impulse seizes them. That's what makes the Internet so dangerous. Without the threat of exposure or fear of punishment, some people don't just cease being good, they become evil.</p><div class="sect1" title="Who Are the Stalkers?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="who_are_the_stalkers_question"/>Who Are the Stalkers?</h1></div></div></div><p>Stalkers can be anyone—a next-door neighbor, a coworker, an ex-spouse or ex-boyfriend/girlfriend, a former or current employee, a relative, even a complete stranger. However, few stalkers have the motivation to pick a stranger at random just so they can attack and harass someone they don't even know. In the majority of cases, stalkers know their victims. Some keep up the harassment for days, weeks, months, and, sometimes, even years.</p><p>Although anyone can be a stalker (or a victim), men are typically the stalkers and women are typically the victims. Some different types of stalkers include the following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Former intimate partners</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>The most common stalkers are former spouses, girlfriends, or boyfriends who are hurt or angry that the relationship with the victim is over. They try to extend the relationship through harassment (following the victim, hanging around the victim's home or workplace, sending letters or emails, constantly calling, etc.). In most cases, the stalker simply wants to revive the relationship and actually believes that stalking can make that dream come true.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Vengeful stalkers</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This type of stalker harasses through threats and even outright acts of violence, such as slashing tires or assaulting or killing his stalking target. Vengeful stalkers believe they are correcting some real, exaggerated, or even imaginary wrong and that the only way to rectify it is to continually harass and threaten or hurt the victim.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0001" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Delusional stalkers</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>These stalkers can range from dangerous to harmless, but since they base their stalking on some imagined love for or anger toward the victim, they can be unpredictable and frightening. They may alternate between being nice and exploding into a sudden fit of rage. Typically delusional stalkers target high-profile victims such as movie stars or other types of celebrities, although it's still possible for a delusional stalker to be a coworker or someone else who has a genuine connection to the victim.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Stalkers don't always fit neatly into one category or another. A stalker might start out as a former intimate lover, then get angrier and turn into a vengeful stalker.</p></div><p>The stereotypical stalker tends to be a loner and social misfit with few friends, poor personal hygiene, and an uneven job history. He often lives alone and rarely cleans or takes care of his home, clothes, or even himself. In general, he cares so little about himself that, not surprisingly, he doesn't care about anyone else either. Rather than learn the proper way to behave around others, he chooses to stalk someone. It's not necessarily a conscious or welcome choice on his part, but it's the only way he knows how to express his emotions, whether for good or bad.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Stalking on the Internet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="stalking_on_the_internet"/>Stalking on the Internet</h1></div></div></div><p>Stalkers have been around since long before the Internet, but cyberspace has given stalkers a new sense of power and anonymity along with the reach to harass victims anywhere in the world. In the old days, stalkers had to rely on making obscene phone calls or leaving notes in places where a victim might find them. Today, stalkers can do this electronically by sending a barrage of email or instant messages. Typically, these messages are designed to taunt or threaten the victim and create the impression that the stalker is always nearby, even if physically in another state or country.</p><p>One stalker even taped a cell phone, with GPS (global position system) tracking turned on, to his ex-girlfriend's car. That way he could follow her movements at all times. If a stalker sends enough email or instant messages, he can flood the victim's computer with useless information and prevent her from receiving any legitimate communications. Some stalkers may try to infect a victim's computer with viruses, RATs (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Trojan Horses and Worms">Chapter 5</a>), or spyware (see <a class="xref" href="ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. Adware and Spyware">Chapter 20</a>) to steal more information (such as credit card numbers or passwords), spy on that person's personal life and activities, or simply to foul up her computer.</p><p>Rather than contact a victim directly, a stalker may spread rumors or embarrassing information through newsgroups or chat rooms. He might impersonate the victim to send bogus email or chat room messages to other people. By insulting or angering others under the guise of the victim, stalkers can confuse a victim, who will not know why or how so many other people seem to be turning against her for no apparent reason.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0002" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Besides insulting or embarrassing a victim, stalkers may try to set up a victim for harassment from others. For example, stalkers might give a victim's email address to spammers, thereby encouraging spammers to flood the victim's email account. A stalker might also give a victim's name, address, phone number, and email address to peculiar characters such as religious cults, sadomasochists, pedophiles, or other unsavory characters, who will then contact the unwitting victim, sowing further confusion and nuisances in the victim's life.</p><p>By tricking others into harassing the victim too, stalkers hide their own complicity while still enjoying the satisfaction of making their victim's life as uncomfortable as possible.</p><p>Internet stalkers are protected by outdated laws that define "stalking" as physically threatening someone. Thus, Internet stalking falls outside the usual boundaries of the law. If someone were physically stalking a victim, she could at least call the local police. Over the Internet, however, the local police are generally helpless; the stalker may not even be in the same country as the victim and may be difficult to track down.</p></div>

On the Internet, that means getting the victim's email address, instant messaging ID, or even IP address. Armed with this, stalkers can usually retrieve other types of information such as telephone numbers, home and work addresses, and even Social Security numbers. Give a stalker just one bit of information and he can likely parlay it into an avalanche of personal data.</p><div class="sect2" title="Searching personal websites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="searching_personal_websites"/>Searching personal websites</h2></div></div></div><p>The easiest way to find information about someone is to search for his personal website. Not only will it probably offer an email address, but it will often include other information such as the person's hobbies, job history, membership in any organizations, and the proper spelling of his or her name. If the personal website has its own unique domain, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.johndoe.com">www.JohnDoe.com</a>, stalkers can do a WHOIS search to find the contact information registered for that site. <a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#a_whois_search_on_a_descriptive_domain_n" title="Figure 14-1. A WHOIS search on a descriptive domain name can identify the name, address, and phone number of the website's owner.">Figure 14-1</a> shows a WHOIS search for Bill Gates, which reveals that he uses a separate company to protect his address from potential stalkers.

Unfortunately, with so many people-finders popping up all the time, this might mean having to contact a dozen different websites—and then there's no guarantee that a new website won't turn up with your information anyway. Even worse, just because you request that your name be removed doesn't mean that the website will do so.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you include a signature file in every email you send out, make sure you don't give out any personal or important information in it, such as a home phone number or a website address (unless you've taken care to hide any personal information off of your website).</p></li></ul></div><p>If you don't want to make your email address available to anyone searching for it, try one or both of the following techniques:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Use an anonymous remailer before posting any messages to a Usenet newsgroup.

Eliminating your paper trail can be a lot of work, but it might be worth it if you're hiding from someone dangerous (like the Internal Revenue Service).</p><p>Despite your best efforts, you may wind up becoming an online stalker's next victim. The moment someone starts sending you harassing emails or instant messages, send them exactly one message asking them to stop. In many cases, a firm and short message such as, "I'm sorry you feel that way, but I feel that you are crossing some boundaries for me and I would prefer it if we end our communication here," will be enough to stop most people. If the person continues harassing you, do not reply. Some stalkers simply enjoy provoking people; if you refuse to rise to the bait, they may get bored and look for more satisfying prey.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0049" class="indexterm"/></p><p>More frightening are the stalkers who target you specifically, either because they know you or because they hold a personal grudge against you because of something as simple as what you posted in a chat room. If you continue receiving harassing emails, examine the email header to find the harasser's ISP and then send an email informing the ISP of the harassment. Many times the ISP will send a warning to the harasser, and that will be enough.</p><p>If the harasser's ISP doesn't respond to you and the harassment continues, store copies of every form of harassment as evidence. If the stalker makes a direct threat to you or your family, such as naming what schools your children go to or what color car you drive, contact the police immediately and give them copies of all the evidence you have collected. Sometimes stalkers delight in terrifying victims from afar and have no intention of harming or getting anywhere near you, but it's better to play it safe and protect yourself.</p><p>Just as you would never wander around a dangerous neighborhood and not expect trouble, so you shouldn't roam the Internet without taking precautions.

</span></span></div></div><p>In the winter 2004 issue of <span class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span>, a hacker wrote an article about how to break into the website of CBS and alter the voting process for a reality show called <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Search</em></span>. Although the article was technically accurate and informative, it showed the true limitations of hacking and aptly demonstrated what author Thomas Pynchon once said: "If you can get people to ask the wrong questions, they'll never find the right answers."</p><p>After describing how easy it was for hackers to manipulate the online voting process, the hacker wondered, "Why is the CBS Star Search online voting security so lax?" Here are two possible answers:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Security is lax because CBS and <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Search</em></span> don't know how to make it better because they don't even realize there's a problem.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Security is lax because online voting doesn't count in the first place.</p></li></ol></div><p>Where the hacker made his mistake was in assuming the first answer to be correct—assuming that CBS had set up a valid online voting system for <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Search</em></span> that conscientiously made an effort to accurately count votes from viewers to determine the ultimate winner of the competition.</p><p>But what if he had assumed that the second answer was the truthful one, that CBS didn't really care about the security of its online voting system because no one ever bothered to count viewers' votes anyway?</p><p>In the fine print of every reality TV show application, there's a disclaimer similar to the following, taken from an application for the CBS program <span class="emphasis"><em>The Amazing Race</em></span>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>All decisions by the Producers concerning selection of participants and other matters is final and not subject to challenge or appeal.</p></blockquote></div><p>That sounds harmless enough, but it really means that the producers have the final and ultimate authority to decide which contestants get picked for the show and which ones get eliminated. So, regardless of whether the show has a panel of judges, telephone voting, or online voting open to the public, the producers still reserve the right to override any decisions made by anyone other than themselves. Comedians Drew Carey and Brett Butler found this out when they served as talent judges for the now-canceled NBC reality show <span class="emphasis"><em>Last Comic Standing</em></span>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>LOS ANGELES (March 8, 2004) – At least two big-name comedians, Drew Carey and Brett Butler, are fuming that the joke was on them when they served as talent judges for a new edition of the NBC reality show "The Last Comic Standing."</p><p>The two sitcom veterans complained Monday that NBC executives and producers of the show overruled their votes for the 10 aspiring comics worthy of advancing to the televised competition set to air this summer.</p><p>"I thought it was crooked and dishonest," Carey, star of the ABC sitcom "The Drew Carey Show," told entertainment trade paper The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Separately, Butler, the former star of "Grace Under Fire," posted a message on her website saying the judges were "both surprised and disappointed at the results and . . . we had NOTHING to do with them."</p><p>NBC said it was up to network brass and producers to decide who made the cut, weighing the opinions of the celebrity panel as just one factor.

(Read the entire story here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thestingray.net/manhunt.probe">www.thestingray.net/manhunt.probe</a>.)</p><p>To learn more about claims that various reality TV shows are rigged, contestants are coached, and voting decisions are overridden, visit the Reality Blurred site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.realityblurred.com">www.realityblurred.com</a>. (In case you're wondering why more reality TV show contestants don't reveal how they were manipulated, they can't because of the contracts they signed. To appear on the TV show, contestants are barred from discussing the show without the television networks approval.)</p><p>In Hollywood, it's an open secret that reality TV shows are rigged for purely pragmatic business reasons. Throw a bunch of strangers together and what usually happens? If you've ever been to a party, you know that, almost always, the answer is "not much." But watch a reality TV show and what happens? Someone always turns out to be a villain and someone else always turns into an underdog. There's always conflict between contestants involving backstabbing, vicious gossip, and exciting dramatic events that capture our imagination and encourage us to watch the next episode.</p><p>Most reality show contestants aren't ordinary people but aspiring actors and actresses whose managers and agents got them on the TV show to gain national exposure and jump-start their careers. With actors pretending to be ordinary people and producers coaching them to behave a certain way, you're guaranteed to end up with a show full of conflict and drama. If hacking is the ultimate in manipulation and control, then reality television producers have hacked the viewing public, because nothing you see on reality TV shows is real.</p><p>If a network is going to invest millions of dollars in a reality TV show, they can't take the chance that something exciting won't happen. They have to take control and actively manipulate the results to make something exciting happen. Check out the job notices at EntertainmentCareers.net, and you can even find ads searching for reality TV show writers, such as this one:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This is a FULL TIME JOB Location: Miami FL Date Posted: 2/14/2005 6:07:48 PM Description: New show is seeking a seasoned writer with a background in dramatic non-fiction writing. Will write the script and storyline for a new program.</p><p>Requirements: Must be able to create dramatic stories with strong climaxes and resolutions. Experience in writing for a reality show is preferred.</p></blockquote></div><p>Once the writers have mapped out storylines and character conflicts, the director takes over and films the contestants in such a way that viewers only see scenes that follow the writers' recommendations for creating phony plots around each contestant. What you see on TV isn't necessarily what happened. It's only one version of many possible alternatives that were filmed. The games and contests you see are just what the writers expected would generate the most conflict and drama to fit their preplanned storyline.</p><p>Some reality TV shows also invite the audience to vote for winners through a 1-900 number phone line or a website. Here's where you discover the real reason why <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Search</em></span> and many other reality shows have such lax security for online voting: They don't care because the votes don't count.</p><p>The purpose of telephone and online voting isn't to choose a winner. The producers, with the aid of the director and a team of writers, made that decision months earlier when the reality show was filmed. Instead, the purpose of telephone and online voting is to give the audience an emotional stake in the show's outcome and encourage them to watch the next episode</p><p>If you dial the 1-900 number to vote, you're just paying money to the producer, not having an impact on the final outcome of the show. If you vote online, you can vote as many times as you want and even hack into the voting system, and nobody cares because nobody's counting the votes. Voting for a reality show contestant is like trying to vote today for the Nixon-Kennedy election of 1960. It's already happened, and nothing you can do will change the result. If you're looking to influence the results of a reality TV show through voting or hacking, you've already lost before the game's begun and you don't even know it.</p><p>Reality TV shows are a business, and business is about minimizing risks for maximum financial return. If computer hackers really want to affect the evolution of a reality show, the best way isn't to manipulate the votes; it's to stop everyone from voting in the first place and expose the deception of the reality show producers when they publicize the so-called results. If you can prevent 100 percent of online votes from even being cast, anything the producers say occurred can be revealed as the lie it really is. (But even then, the reality show producers are one step ahead of you. They grant themselves the right to ignore online voting due to "technical difficulties.")</p><p>The lesson to learn from reality TV shows is that hacking is more than mere technical skill; it's seeing beyond the obvious, questioning unspoken assumptions, and exposing lies. Hack away at all the reality TV voting sites as much as you like. It won't matter; the outcome has already been decided, and it's never going to be decided by you.

In the world of reality TV show programming, you've been hacked and deceived from the start, and I guarantee it. Oh, wait a minute.

The news media gets its information from its own reporters, from wire services, and from anyone else who contacts them with an interesting story. Slip misleading information to the news media, and it's possible that the reporters won't bother to verify the facts and will simply present the information as news in the interest of higher ratings.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One self-proclaimed multimedia artist, Joey Skaggs (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joeyskaggs.com">www.joeyskaggs.com</a>) has turned misinformation into an art form, using the media itself as his canvas to demonstrate their frequent gullibility in broadcasting "news" without verifying the source's credibility. Joey Skaggs has appeared on <span class="emphasis"><em>Good Morning America</em></span> and CNN, and in print in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Washington Post</em></span>, discussing such outrageous "news" as a vitamin pill made from cockroaches; a brothel for dogs; a new genetically engineered chemical, dubbed BioPEEP, that gets people addicted to eating certain foods; and a "celebrity sperm bank," where Bob Dylan and The Beatles had allegedly left deposits.</p><p>Joey Skaggs boasts that he leaves plenty of clues for news reporters to identify his pranks, yet they never find this information simply because they never bother verifying the "facts" he provides. One television station even won an Emmy for reporting on Joey Skaggs's brothel-for-dogs story ("A cat house for dogs featuring a savory selection of hot bitches"). Later, when Joey insisted that he had made up the whole thing, the news station reported his denial as further "evidence" that he was trying to avoid criminal responsibility for running his (fictional) dog brothel.</p><p>Next time you form an opinion based on something you've read, seen, or heard from your favorite trusted news source, remember that it could be the truth, it could be partial information lacking crucial facts, or it could just be another media hoax perpetrated by someone like Joey Skaggs.

You can get a feel for the mood surrounding a particular newsworthy event, such as the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, by browsing through old web pages, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15s05.html#viewing_history_through_web_pages_from_t" title="Figure 15-6. Viewing history through web pages from the past.">Figure 15-6</a>.</p><p>The Internet Archive also stores video clips of old television reports, along with a library of TV commercials and government films distributed since the 1940s. From these old government films, you can see how much (or how little) the American government has really changed.</p><p>Some classics include the infamous "Duck and Cover" film, which taught children to survive a nuclear attack by holding a jacket over their heads, and another short film explaining the hazards of biowarfare, which warns that Communist agents could attack the United States by pouring toxins into our water supply or by using crop dusters to spray an entire area with germs.

"All across the country, newspaper editorial boards—no great friends of business—are ripping the bills," pro–Wal-Mart bloggers claimed, and they used those exact same words because it was later revealed that they had been written and distributed to the bloggers by Wal-Mart's public relations company. While there's nothing wrong with bloggers reprinting someone else's words, there is something wrong when they don't reveal the source of those same words and pretend that they're original thoughts of their own.</p><div class="figure"><a id="blogs_can_bring_you_news_from_the_eyewit"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e11297"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676655.png.jpg" alt="Blogs can bring you news from the eyewitnesses themselves."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-15. Blogs can bring you news from the eyewitnesses themselves.</p></div><p>After exposing Wal-Mart's astroturfing of blogs, the <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> later revealed the contents of an internal Wal-Mart memo that focused on these same health care issues. According to this memo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/26walmart.pdf">www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/26walmart.pdf</a>), Wal-Mart suggests that one way to discourage unhealthy job applicants is to make sure "all jobs to include some physical activity (e.g., all cashiers do some cart-gathering)."</p><p>The memo further states that "it will be far easier to attract and retain a healthier work force than it will be to change behavior in an existing one. These moves would also dissuade unhealthy people from coming to work at Wal-Mart."</p><p>Trying to sort out facts, lies, and altered perceptions on blogs will likely become a new Internet pastime. Many blogs are now as unreliable as the traditional news media when it comes to reporting the truth, and as the effectiveness of using blogs to propagate one's view becomes more widely known, they will increasingly tend toward the same weaknesses that keep the traditional media from reporting the truth. Reality is only what you choose to see, and alarmingly, what people choose to see is what someone else decides they should see.</p></div>

</span></span></div></div><p>Guess who has more political power in a democracy—an individual who can cast a single vote once every few years, or a major corporation that can shower politicians with campaign donations and other monetary favors any day of the week?</p><p>As much as the powers that be would like you to believe that your vote actually counts (when it's not being lost by a voting machine), the reality is that most individuals feel powerless and helpless in the face of lobbyist groups and corporate influence. That's why desperate people often resort to violence to force governments to deal with long-standing problems. For example, blacks protested against racial inequality during the April 1992 Los Angeles riots (sparked by the acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating Rodney King), and French immigrants rioted in October 2005 to protest high unemployment rates and police brutality in their community. Before riots brought attention to these issues, the problems were largely ignored by the governments that should have been actively looking for solutions.</p><p>Rather than waiting until situations reach such a boiling point, many individuals channel their energy into activist organizations. Before the Internet, activists had to rely on meetings, newsletters, and mass mailings to attract supporters and to keep their members organized and informed. However, the Internet has given them a medium for spreading their ideas and publicizing their goals to a worldwide audience.</p><p>To learn more about using the Internet to form or improve an activist group, read The Virtual Activist, a training course offered by NetAction (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.netaction.org">www.netaction.org</a>). If you want to find a protest rally near you, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://protest.net">Protest.Net</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.protest.net">www.protest.net</a>), which lists events around the world and offers an Activist Handbook to help people get involved, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#protest.net_lists_different_events_by_ge" title="Figure 16-1. Protest.Net lists different events by geographic location, date, and topic so you can demonstrate around the world at your convenience.">Figure 16-1</a>.</p><p>Email, websites, and instant messaging let activists communicate faster and more conveniently, but the real promise (or threat) of the Internet is as a protest medium in and of itself. The Internet provides the opportunity for virtual sit-ins and blockades, email bombing, web page defacing, and the creation and spread of worms and viruses for a cause.</p><div class="figure"><a id="protest.net_lists_different_events_by_ge"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e11371"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676657.png.jpg" alt="Protest.Net lists different events by geographic location, date, and topic so you can demonstrate around the world at your convenience."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-1. <a class="ulink" href="http://protest.net">Protest.Net</a> lists different events by geographic location, date, and topic so you can demonstrate around the world at your convenience.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Virtual Sit-ins and Blockades"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual_sit-ins_and_blockades"/>Virtual Sit-ins and Blockades</h1></div></div></div><p>One common form of protest involves physically taking over or blocking access to an area or a building, such as the April 9, 1969, takeover of a Harvard University administration building by 300 students protesting the Vietnam War. Such sit-ins rarely cause any damage, but they help bring attention to the protesters' cause, especially if the protesters can occupy and shut down a high-profile target like Harvard. (Taking over and holding the men's room at a gas station in Barstow, California, wouldn't have quite the same dramatic effect, no matter how many people might be involved.)<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Because physical takeovers can be difficult to organize, many activists engage in virtual sit-ins and blockades that anyone can join, no matter where they are.

With such a massive flood of visitors, the Strano Network hoped to overwhelm the French government's webservers and knock their sites offline, which, according to some reports, they succeeded in doing.</p><p>What was unique about the world's first virtual sit-in was that it not only attacked a target and prevented legitimate users from accessing it, but it did so using completely legal methods. Participants in a physical sit-in risk arrest for trespassing, among other things, but there's nothing illegal about individuals visiting a single website simultaneously. The result, however, is a denial of service attack for which one individual person cannot be held responsible.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Zapatistas on the Internet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="zapatistas_on_the_internet"/>Zapatistas on the Internet</h2></div></div></div><p>Few people know where Chiapas is (it's on the southern tip of Mexico), and even fewer people know who the Zapatistas are (they're the indigenous people of Chiapas, named for Emiliano Zapata, an early–20th-century Mexican revolutionary leader who fought for land and freedom for his people). All that changed on January 1, 1994, when the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) declared war against the Mexican state and demanded the liberation of the people of Chiapas and Mexico. As part of the Zapatistas' war declaration, they explained how the state of Chiapas was one of the poorest in Mexico, yet accounted for much of Mexico's oil wealth, along with exports of lumber, coffee, and beef.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Zapatistas initially tried communicating their mission to the world through traditional news media, such as CNN and the Mexican state-controlled TV network, Televisa, but they found their letters, reports, and stories severely edited, which prevented others from understanding the true nature of their rebellion. Only the Mexican newspaper <span class="emphasis"><em>La Jornada</em></span> published the Zapatistas' materials complete and unedited, but this newspaper rarely reached anyone outside of Mexico City. As far as the traditional news media were concerned, the Zapatistas didn't exist and most people reading the limited news coverage concluded that they were simply troublemakers who deserved to be put down.</p><p>Even when the Mexican government rushed in 15,000 troops to suppress the rebellion militarily, the media continued to downplay news about the Zapatistas, effectively muzzling their pleas for freedom and ignoring their reports of government suppression and exploitation. To circumvent the indifference of the traditional news media, Zapatista supporters started typing or scanning information from the group and distributing it over the Internet.</p><p>People translated the Spanish text into English and other languages, and soon the Zapatistas' plight began attracting attention from overseas newspapers and magazines that might never have bothered to cover the rebellion otherwise. When the Mexican Army surrounded 12,000 guerillas, the Zapatistas reported through the Internet that they had escaped the encirclement and conquered several nearby villages, which caused confusion in world markets and brought about a sudden drop in the value of the Mexican peso. As more independent news media sources confirmed the Zapatistas' claims (to the embarrassment of the Mexican government), the Zapatista movement gained more credibility and garnered more interest. In this case, the Zapatistas didn't have to stage a virtual sit-in to publicize their plight; they simply used newsgroups, email, and websites to broadcast the Zapatista struggle to the rest of the world.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To learn more about the Zapatistas, visit the Zapatistas Network (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zapatistas.org">www.zapatistas.org</a>), shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#the_zapatistas_were_one_of_the_first_dis" title="Figure 16-2. The Zapatistas were one of the first dissident groups to take advantage of the Internet to publicize their plight.">Figure 16-2</a>, or Chiapas Watch (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zmag.org/chiapas1">www.zmag.org/chiapas1</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_zapatistas_were_one_of_the_first_dis"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e11476"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676659.png.jpg" alt="The Zapatistas were one of the first dissident groups to take advantage of the Internet to publicize their plight."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-2. The Zapatistas were one of the first dissident groups to take advantage of the Internet to publicize their plight.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Disturbance on demand"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="disturbance_on_demand"/>Disturbance on demand</h2></div></div></div><p>A group calling itself the Electronic Disturbance Theater (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.thing.net/~rdom/ecd/EDTECD.html">www.thing.net/~rdom/ecd/EDTECD.html</a>) has taken the Zapatistas' cause to a new level by developing virtual activism software and organizing Internet strikes, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#on_september_5_comma_1998_comma_the_elec" title="Figure 16-3. On September 5, 1998, the Electronic Disturbance Theater called for an Internet strike against the Pentagon, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and Mexican President Zedillo's website to support the Zapatistas.">Figure 16-3</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To organize its Internet strikes, the Electronic Disturbance Theater created a special Java applet dubbed FloodNet that participants could install to reload the target websites automatically every few seconds.

Despite these countermeasures, the Electronic Disturbance Theater declared their second Internet strike a success too, noting that "our interest is to help the people of Chiapas to keep receiving the international recognition that they need to keep them alive."</p><p>On January 3, 2000, Zapatista supporters wrote messages to the Mexican soldiers fighting to suppress the Zapatista rebellion, folded these messages into paper airplanes, and then launched the Zapatista "Air Force." To commemorate this event, the Electronic Disturbance Theater created the Zapatista Tribal Port Scan (ZTPS) program, which works in a similar way by scanning a random port on a target computer and sending it a text message as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#the_zapatista_tribal_port_scanner_can_bo" title="Figure 16-4. The Zapatista Tribal Port Scanner can bombard a target computer's ports with text messages.">Figure 16-4</a>.</p><p>Besides the Zapatistas, the Electronic Disturbance Theater has supported a variety of other causes as well. To oppose US military strikes and economic sanctions against Iraq, the Electronic Disturbance Theater used its FloodNet program to attack the White House website, and in January 1999, it also helped organize animal-rights activists to protest different websites in Sweden.

Indeed, it's possible to send a barrage of messages, flooding a target's mailbox and preventing the recipient from reading or receiving legitimate messages. Known as email flooding or bombing, the end result is one form of a denial of service attack. <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#an_email_bomber_can_flood_the_internet_w" title="Figure 16-5. An email bomber can flood the Internet with custom messages directed to the target specified by the user.">Figure 16-5</a> shows a typical mass emailing program that can be used to send multiple messages to a single target (mail bombing) or a single message to multiple targets (spamming).</p><p>The first known use of email bombing for political means occurred in 1998 when the Tamil guerillas of Sri Lanka reportedly swamped Sri Lankan embassies with thousands of email messages that read: "We are the Internet Black Tigers and we're doing this to disrupt your communications."

When one California resident, Richard Clark, heard of this hacker attack against NATO, he reportedly co-opted the technique to retaliate, deluging the Yugoslavian government's website with more than 500,000 messages a day until its site went down. (Richard Clark's ISP, Pacific Bell, later canceled his service for violating its antispam policy.)</p><p>The Institute for Global Communications (IGC), a San Francisco–based Internet service provider, was hit by an email bombing attack in 1997 for hosting the website of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span>, an online publication supporting the Basque separatist movement in Spain and France. Protesters claimed that IGC supported terrorism because part of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span> site contained information from the terrorist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), which killed more than 800 people during its 30-year struggle for Basque independence.</p><p>In an effort to convince IGC to stop hosting the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span> website, protesters bombarded the company with thousands of messages, which were routed through a multitude of different computers so ICG wouldn't be able to block mail from a single source. To add further pressure, protesters also email-bombed IGC employees as well as any other company with a website hosted by IGC, and clogged up the online ordering forms of commercial websites hosted by the target with bogus credit card orders.</p><p>IGC finally took down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span> site, but not before archiving its web pages. Within days, several other sites had posted copies of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span> site on three different continents. Although the protesters succeeded in censoring IGC, they failed in their ultimate objective to shut out the <span class="emphasis"><em>Euskal Herria Journal</em></span> from the rest of the world.

By defacing high-profile websites, hacktivists can ensure that a large group of people will read their message.

An American hacking group called Team Spl0it claims to have defaced web pages of the Yugoslavian government with messages saying, "Tell your governments to stop the war." The Serb Black Hand hackers group claims it retaliated by deleting all the data on a US Navy computer.</p><p>Perhaps more frightening is that hackers have targeted many sensitive US government websites and claim to have gotten in. In May 2001, the official White House site (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">www.whitehouse.gov</a>) even shut down for three days due to a nonstop denial of service attack by unknown hackers. Another hacker group, Hong Kong Danger Duo, later claimed to have broken into the White House site and left the message, "Stop all war. Consintrate on your problems. Nothing was damaged, but we are not telling how we got in."</p><p>After NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in 1999, Chinese hackers entered the fray, targeting official US government websites. The Department of the Interior's website was defaced with pictures of the three Chinese journalists who had been killed in the bombing, while the Department of Energy's website contained a message that read:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Protest U.S.A.'s Nazi action!

One hacker group, the Hong Kong Blondes, allegedly infiltrated police and security networks to monitor China's intelligence activities and warn political dissidents of imminent arrests. Two hackers, called Bronc Buster and Zyklon, claimed they disabled five Chinese firewalls, allowing Chinese citizens uncensored Internet access.</p><p>After Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui declared on July 9, 1999, that China had to deal with Taiwan on a "state-to-state" basis, a cyberwar quickly erupted between each country's respective hackers. The Taiwanese hackers planted a red and blue Taiwanese national flag and an anti-Communist slogan: "Reconquer, Reconquer, Reconquer the Mainland," on Chinese Internet company websites.

In place of the original home page, the Red Devils Crew hacktivists posted the following message.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We were deeply shocked seeing a Danish newspaper (Jyllands Posten) offending almost 1.5 billion Muslims around the world by publishing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed seen as a terrorist carrying bombs on his head!<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0028" class="indexterm"/></p><p>I just wonder, would your government reaction have been the same if the cartoon displayed Prophets Jesus or Moses!?

Although it may be illegal, and breaking into a computer may be considered trespassing, it's certainly a less destructive alternative to shooting, bombing, and slaughtering. In that regard, hacking could actually be considered more ethical than any traditional show of military force.</p></div>

Botha. When one of these names was typed, the Fu Manchu virus would change it to an obscene word. Another early hacktivist worm appeared when anti-nuclear protesters tried to stop NASA from launching the Galileo probe toward Jupiter, because the probe's booster contained radioactive plutonium as fuel. On October 16, 1989, hackers infected NASA's network with the WANK worm, which NASA officials estimate cost a half a million dollars' worth of time and resources to clean up. When run, the WANK worm displayed the following message:<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0031" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting4_d1e11723"/><pre class="programlisting">W O R M S   A G A I N S T   N U C L E A R   K I L L E R S

Two hacktivist worms include the Mari@mm worm and the Injustice worm. These worms work like many others; each can send a copy of itself to every email address stored in a target's Microsoft Outlook address book. When the Mari@mm worm infects a computer, it puts a marijuana icon on the screen.

That wasn't the case in February 1999, however, when 14-year-old Israeli Nir Zigdon told the London <span class="emphasis"><em>Sunday Telegraph</em></span> that he had single-handedly wiped out an Iraqi government website that, he said, "contained lies about the United States, Britain and Israel, and many horrible statements against Jews." Nir Zigdon said, "I figured that if Israel is afraid of assassinating Saddam Hussein, at least I can try to destroy his site."</p><p>Nir Zigdon reportedly sent an email attachment to the site and "claimed I was a Palestinian admirer of Saddam who had produced a virus capable of wiping out Israeli websites. That persuaded them to open the message and click the designated file. Within hours the site had been destroyed. Shortly afterwards I received an email from the site manager, Fayiz, that told me to 'go to hell'."</p></div>

Molleindustria (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.molleindustria.it">www.molleindustria.it</a>) offers a game called Tamatipico, wherein players control a factory worker to make him more productive. Watch out though. Work him too hard and let his happiness level drop, and he'll actually become less productive (which is a lesson that too many managers seem to forget).<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0034" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Newsgaming (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.newsgaming.com">www.newsgaming.com</a>) offers two unique political video games called Madrid and September 12th.

In this game, players aim missiles at known terrorists stalking the streets. If you accidentally kill an innocent bystander, you wind up creating more terrorists until, eventually, you end up with more terrorists than you started with, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch16s05.html#the_september_12th_video_game_challenges" title="Figure 16-12. The September 12th video game challenges you to kill terrorists without inadvertently killing civilians and creating more terrorists.">Figure 16-12</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_september_12th_video_game_challenges"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e11820"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676679.png.jpg" alt="The September 12th video game challenges you to kill terrorists without inadvertently killing civilians and creating more terrorists."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 16-12. The September 12th video game challenges you to kill terrorists without inadvertently killing civilians and creating more terrorists.</p></div><p>During the 2004 Presidential elections, the Republican Party even released a political video game called Tax Invaders.

The idea behind this game was to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald could have been a lone gunman who killed John F. Kennedy with his sniper rifle. The player assumes the role of Oswald and gets a chance to re-create history by trying to assassinate the president. The closer your shots mimic what Oswald did, the higher your score. Initially, Traffic Management even offered a $100,000 reward to the first person that could re-create Oswald's shots most accurately.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0037" class="indexterm"/></p><p>By playing a video game like JFK: Reloaded, you can rewrite history and aim for Jackie Kennedy or even go for the driver, instead of JFK himself. If you kill the driver, the motorcade might stop and then you can pick off the stranded occupants one by one. Alternately, if you shoot the driver, the game might have the driver slump forward and crash the limousine into a lamppost.</p><p>Although the publisher claimed it had developed the game to debunk conspiracy theories about shots coming from other places, such as the grassy knoll, it caused a storm of controversy that eventually drove the company out of business. While derided as tasteless by many, JFK: Reloaded does raise an interesting question. If shooting an animated figure of a president is so despicable, why is it considered "entertainment" to shoot nameless animated figures in other video games?</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Google Bombing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="google_bombing"/>Google Bombing</h1></div></div></div><p>As the most popular search engine (at the time of this writing), Google controls which websites people find when they hunt for specific words or phrases. Search for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dell</em></span> and Google responds with hundreds of results, although the top websites listed relate directly to Dell Computers. These results are determined by measuring the websites' perceived popularity, which is partly based on the number of sites that link back to them. Google bombing entails artificially inflating a website's Google ranking by fabricating links to that site and scattering them all over the Internet.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-16-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><p>While it's nearly impossible for one individual to create enough links to affect a website's ranking, it's pretty easy once you have lots of other people posting links on their websites, in newsgroups, in chat rooms, on blogs, in email messages, and so on, until the Internet is inundated.</p><p>In 1999, people found that if they typed the phrase <span class="emphasis"><em>more evil than Satan</em></span> into Google, Microsoft's home page came up in the top rankings. In 2005, Google bombing linked the words <span class="emphasis"><em>miserable failure</em></span> to both George W. Bush's and Michael Moore's websites. Searching for the phrase <span class="emphasis"><em>worst President</em></span> also returned George W. Bush's website, so Bush supporters Google-bombed the Internet in retaliation so that <span class="emphasis"><em>great President</em></span> would also point to George W. Bush's website.</p><p>In another example, a search for <span class="emphasis"><em>Jew</em></span> in Google ranks the top website as JewWatch, an anti-Semitic site run by white power nationalist Frank Weltner. (See <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Hate Groups and Terrorists on the Internet">Chapter 17</a> for more information about hate groups.) As a result, the editor of the blog Jew School (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jewschool.com">www.jewschool.com</a>) is now soliciting websites to help him Google bomb the JewWatch site off its top ranking.</p><p>So the next time you search Google, check the list of results carefully. Some of the websites may be legitimate, but some may be benefactors of artificially inflated rankings. How can you tell the difference? You can't, which is why you may have to examine every website to figure out its real political agenda.</p></div>

Foreman reportedly accepted a 10-year deal to act as the unofficial radical wing of the environmental movement. In this role, he was free to pursue controversial activities that neither the Sierra Club nor the Wilderness Society could publicly support, such as the torching of a housing development in San Diego and the burning of Hummer and SUV dealerships in Los Angeles. In his book <span class="emphasis"><em>Confessions of an Eco-Warrior</em></span>, Dave Foreman even bragged that that "ecotage [economic sabotage] in the National Forests alone in the United States is costing industry and government $20–25 million annually."</p><p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has also come under the scrutiny of ActivistCash.com, which claims PETA paid $27,000 for the legal defense of Roger Troen, who was arrested for taking part in an October 1986 burglary and arson at the University of Oregon. Elsewhere, $7,500 went to Fran Stephanie Trutt, who tried to murder the president of a medical laboratory, and $5,000 went to Josh Harper, who attacked Native Americans on a whale hunt by throwing smoke bombs, shooting flares, and spraying their faces with chemical fire extinguishers.<a id="IDX-CHP-16-0044" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Even Mothers against Drunk Drivers (MADD) is not free from criticism by ActivistCash.com, which claims that the group has unnecessarily expanded its mission to prohibit alcohol use entirely.

The actors in ape costume always sat together during lunch, while the actors dressed up as orangutans sat in another area. It might seem amusing that actors would only feel comfortable socializing with those in similar costumes, but it does highlight a general trait among humans. People naturally gravitate toward others who look like them and unconsciously avoid anyone who doesn't.</p><p>Historically, the human race has always divided itself based on various characteristics such as skin color, religious beliefs, ideology, or artificial national boundaries. Such distinctions wouldn't be problematic if so many people didn't use them as excuses to hate, discriminate, and kill.</p><div class="sect1" title="Hate Groups on the Internet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hate_groups_on_the_internet"/>Hate Groups on the Internet</h1></div></div></div><p>In the old days, hate groups usually operated regionally, setting up secret meetings, passing out mimeographed pamphlets, and mailing photocopied newsletters. That all changed with the spread of the Internet. The mass communication medium of the Internet allows hate groups to use websites, email, and newsgroups to establish an international presence to recruit new members and share ideas with similar groups anywhere on the planet.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In a March 13, 1995, <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> article, Don Black, an ex–Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and owner of the white supremacist homepage Stormfront (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.stormfront.org">www.stormfront.org</a>), was quoted as saying that the "Internet has had a pretty profound influence on the [white supremacist] movement whose resources are limited. The access is anonymous and there is unlimited ability to communicate with others of a like mind."</p><p>Of course, hate groups aren't limited to just white supremacists, skinheads, and neo-Nazis. There are also anti-Semitic Holocaust deniers, black radicals, Christian nationalists, anti-gay activists, anti-Christian groups, and anti-Arab groups. For virtually any group of people, you can be sure there's someone else with a reason to hate them.</p><p>To fight back against intolerance in any form, several organizations have dedicated themselves to tracking hate groups and monitoring their online activities. To learn more about hate groups and ways to combat their influence, you should visit the websites for <a class="ulink" href="http://tolerance.org">Tolerance.org</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tolerance.org">www.tolerance.org</a>), The Hate Directory (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bcpl.net/~rfrankli/hatedir.htm">www.bcpl.net/~rfrankli/hatedir.htm</a>), and the Southern Poverty Law Center (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.splcenter.org">www.splcenter.org</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://tolerance.org">Tolerance.org</a> even tracks hate groups by state, so you find the ones near you, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#tolerance.org_tracks_hate_groups_by_stat" title="Figure 17-1. Tolerance.org tracks hate groups by state.">Figure 17-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="tolerance.org_tracks_hate_groups_by_stat"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12120"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676685.png.jpg" alt="Tolerance.org tracks hate groups by state."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-1. <a class="ulink" href="http://tolerance.org">Tolerance.org</a> tracks hate groups by state.</p></div><p>Perhaps the most well known white supremacy group is the Ku Klux Klan (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kkk.com">www.kkk.com</a>), whose homepage proudly boasts that it is "Bringing a Message of Hope and Deliverance to White Christian America! A Message of Love NOT Hate!" Unlike earlier incarnations of the Klan, today's organization has toned down the hateful rhetoric and emphasizes the positive aspects of white pride by claiming to be "America's Largest, Oldest, and Most Professional White Rights Organization—We Love You!"</p><p>Hate groups also create separate websites to attack their enemies, often without revealing their own involvement. One of the more devious tricks of white supremacy groups is to snatch up domain names that appear to belong to legitimate organizations. For example, MartinLutherKing.org and MLKing.org are owned by the two white supremacy groups Stormfront and National Alliance, respectively. Both domain names point to the same website, which derides Martin Luther King as "Just a sexual degenerate, an America-hating Communist, and a criminal betrayer of even the interests of his own people." Ironically, much of the negative information posted about Martin Luther King on these sites comes from declassified government documents from the 1960s, when the FBI organized a smear campaign against King. Although the FBI's propaganda has been largely discredited, it does show how the agency (with the support of the US government) discriminated against blacks at one time and, by today's standards, would be considered a white supremacy hate group too.</p><p>Some hate groups might filter the content on their own websites to appear moderate but provide links to other sites that espouse their point of view in more extreme terms. Using this method, the Jewish Defense League (JDL)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jdl.org.il">www.jdl.org.il</a>—directs visitors to websites that attack Islam, such as the AnsweringIslam site (<a class="ulink" href="http://answering-islam.org.uk">http://answering-islam.org.uk</a>), which claims:<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The truth is that Islam is a man-made religion, full of hatred and venom and the followers of this horrible cult are being led away from God and salvation at an astonishing pace.</p></blockquote></div><p>Another self-serving tactic that hate groups use to mislead visitors is to display a moderate homepage and bury their more radical rhetoric deeper within the site. An example of this is the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ihr.org">www.ihr.org</a>), whose homepage states:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Founded in 1978, the Institute for Historical Review is a public interest educational, research and publishing center dedicated to promoting greater public awareness of history, and especially socially-politically relevant aspects of twentieth century history. The IHR particularly strives to increase understanding of the causes, nature and consequences of war and conflict.</p></blockquote></div><p>Such sober-minded, scholarly language gives the organization credibility and makes it seem balanced, but when you get to the Leaflet section, you'll find yourself bombarded with anti-Jewish articles that dispel any illusion of scholarly research and debate. Some titles of such articles include "Iraq: A War for Israel," "Auschwitz: Myths and Facts," and "The Holocaust: Let's Hear Both Sides."</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Racist Video Games"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="racist_video_games"/>Racist Video Games</h1></div></div></div><p>Besides creating websites that promote their agenda, hate groups are also spreading their rhetoric through racist video games. If you visit Resistance Records (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.resistance.com">www.resistance.com</a>), you can buy a video game called Ethnic Cleansing, a first-person shooter game in which players wander through urban streets and subway tunnels in search of African American, Hispanic, and Jewish characters to gun down.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Neo-Nazi Gary Lauck, of Lincoln, Nebraska, known as the "Farmbelt Führer," also offers several racist video games on his website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.auschwitz.biz">www.auschwitz.biz</a>), including one in which players manage a concentration camp. Another white supremacist, Tom Metzger, runs The Insurgent (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.resist.com">www.resist.com</a>), which offers online Flash games including Border Patrol (in which the object is to shoot people sneaking across the Mexican border), Drive By (in which players drive through a neighborhood and shoot at joggers, bicyclists, and hookers), and Kaboom! (in which players control a Palestinian suicide bomber and try to kill as many Jewish people as possible), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17s02.html#racist_video_games_let_you_try_to_kill_p" title="Figure 17-2. Racist video games let you try to kill people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds.">Figure 17-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="racist_video_games_let_you_try_to_kill_p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12183"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676687.png.jpg" alt="Racist video games let you try to kill people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-2. Racist video games let you try to kill people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds.</p></div><p>Racist video games provide yet another way for hate groups to influence people and spread their messages of intolerance. Racist groups gear these games primarily to young men and boys, the exact demographic group from which they need to recruit future members. Just like any good business, hate groups understand the effectiveness of targeted marketing.</p><p>So the next time your children are playing a video game, peek over their shoulders. They could be playing a commercially acceptable game like Grand Theft Auto, in which the goal is to steal cars, sell drugs, and escape from the police, or they could be playing a racist game like Border Patrol, in which they attempt to shoot people they don't like. In either case, you have to ask yourself, are these the values you want your children to grow up embracing?</p></div>

In general, they avoid military-style confrontations.</p><p>Terrorists, on the other hand, want to kill anyone who doesn't share their way of thinking.</p><p>Although terrorism isn't new, the way terrorists communicate and coordinate their attacks has changed with the introduction of the Internet, which offers terrorists the same advantages it offers other users:<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Anonymity</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Instantaneous global communication</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ease of use</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" title="The myth of cyberterrorism"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_cyberterrorism"/>The myth of cyberterrorism</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the most pervasive threats to national security has been the fear of <span class="emphasis"><em>cyberterrorism</em></span> or a "digital Pearl Harbor," where terrorists destroy a nation's infrastructure using nothing more than a computer, well-crafted viruses or Trojan horses, and hacking skills. Examples of what cyberterrorism could accomplish range from the frightening to the bizarre, as outlined in the 1997 paper "The Future of Cyberterrorism" (<a class="ulink" href="http://afgen.com/terrorism1.html">http://afgen.com/terrorism1.html</a>) by Barry C. Collin of the Institute for Security and Intelligence.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One possible cyberterrorist scenario, envisioned by Collin, involves hacking into an air traffic control system and redirecting civilian aircraft to collide. A more unusual scenario warned that hackers could break into the processing control system of a cereal manufacturer and raise the level of iron supplement in cereal, causing children to overdose on iron, get sick, and possibly die.</p><p>Another scenario has cyberterrorists disrupting the computers that control international financial transactions, causing banks to fail and stock markets to crash (which means that corrupt politicians and CEOs of major corporations could be classified as cyberterrorists, if they only used a computer).</p><p>Although the idea of cyberterrorism sounds frightening, the reality is much less exciting. It's not that cyberterrorism isn't possible, but that it isn't probable. Just as it's possible for a rogue nation-state to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at the United States, it's also possible that such large, coordinated attacks on computer systems could be carried out. However, just as an actual attack from a country like North Korea or Iran is much less likely than a terrorist attack involving conventional explosives, the threat of nightmare cyberterrorism scenarios is actually relatively small.</p><p>Cryptography expert Bruce Schneier has even written a book, <span class="emphasis"><em>Beyond Fear</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.schneier.com/book-beyondfear.html">www.schneier.com/book-beyondfear.html</a>), that dispels much of the threat of cyberterrorism. Some of his amusing quotes include: "Did you ever wonder why tweezers were confiscated at security checkpoints, but matches and cigarette lighters—actual combustible materials—were not? . . . If the tweezers lobby had more power, I'm sure they would have been allowed on board as well," and "When the U.S. Government says that security against terrorism is worth curtailing individual civil liberties, it's because the cost of that decision is not borne by those making it."</p><p>Most terrorists have a vested interest in keeping the Internet running, because it's what they use to communicate with each other, too. Hacking into an air traffic control computer could cause a plane crash, but it's much simpler to shoot the plane down with a shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile or sneak a bomb on board instead. Moreover, it's hard for the authorities to deny a terrorist attack when a bomb blows up. Terrorists want to frighten people with the certainty of an imminent attack and the fear of future attacks. Cyberterrorism is too difficult to conduct and less dramatic and certain in its results.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Terrorists on the Internet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="terrorists_on_the_internet"/>Terrorists on the Internet</h2></div></div></div><p>Nobody doubts that terrorists would engage in cyberterrorism if they could and if it were as effective as blowing something up. Instead, they're more likely to use the Internet simply as a communication medium.</p><p>At the simplest level, terrorist groups can post information about themselves on websites to promote their cause, recruit new members, and provide the latest news about their enemies. As an example, the Hizbullah of Lebanon site (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.moqawama.net">www.moqawama.net</a>) is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17s03.html#the_hizbullah_of_lebanon_website_describ" title="Figure 17-3. The Hizbullah of Lebanon website describes Israeli aggression and its own attacks against Israeli targets.">Figure 17-3</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0013" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_hizbullah_of_lebanon_website_describ"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12270"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676689.png.jpg" alt="The Hizbullah of Lebanon website describes Israeli aggression and its own attacks against Israeli targets."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-3. The Hizbullah of Lebanon website describes Israeli aggression and its own attacks against Israeli targets.</p></div><p>Some other terrorist groups that have established websites include Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.palestine-info.info">www.palestine-info.info</a>, Hizbullah (Party of God) of Iraq (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.nasrollah.org">www.nasrollah.org</a>), Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.qudsway.com">www.qudsway.com</a>, and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.eelam.com">www.eelam.com</a>).</p><p>Like those of hate groups, terrorist websites often use moderate language to explain their mission and gain sympathy from the public, and cleverly omit references to such harsh facts as the group's tendency to kill innocent people in pursuit of its long-range goals.</p><p>To learn about terrorist groups around the world, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://terroristfiles.org">TerroristFiles.org</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.terrorismfiles.org">www.terrorismfiles.org</a>), Global Terror Alert (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.globalterroralert.com">www.globalterroralert.com</a>), or the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ict.org.il">www.ict.org.il</a>).</p><p>Besides websites, terrorists use all the other ordinary tools of the Internet to communicate with one another, such as email, IRC chat rooms, and instant messaging. Some government officials believe that terrorists could even be using steganography, which involves hiding messages in pictures posted on websites that other terrorist members can download and read.</p><p>Although terrorists could use encryption and steganography to mask their messages, it's probably easier for them to communicate in plain language, using code words that nobody else will understand. Paradoxically, encryption can highlight the fact that a person is trying to hide something.</p><p>Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the planners of the 9-11 terrorist attacks, reportedly received a phone call from Mohamed Atta, the leader of the hijackers, who told him, "Two sticks, a dash and a cake with a stick down," which meant that they were ready to execute their planned attack. Anyone intercepting this type of information would probably dismiss it as useless, making encryption completely unnecessary.<a id="IDX-CHP-17-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-17-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A message using plain English code words might be ignored, but an encrypted message raises questions—who sent it, who's receiving it, and what does it really mean? In some ways, using encryption can actually bring unwanted attention to terrorists.</p><p>From an economic point of view, large-scale terrorism is expensive to fund. It involves training people, buying equipment, and housing terrorist cells all over the world. Drug smuggling has long been a favorite source of funding, but now terrorists may be delving into Internet fraud as well.</p><p>Online scams (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. The Internet Con Artists">Chapter 13</a>) can be the perfect source for funds because they're easy to run, difficult to trace, and nearly impossible to prosecute across national boundaries, especially in developing countries where terrorists are most likely to congregate and where cyberlaws are weak or nonexistent.</p><p>Imam Samudra, the convicted mastermind behind the 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, even wrote a chapter in his autobiography (written while on death row) titled, "Hacking, Why Not?" In this chapter, Samudra urges fellow Muslim radicals to fund their activities through online credit card fraud and money laundering. Evidence found on Samudra's laptop revealed that he even tried to finance the Bali bombing through phishing attacks to swipe credit card numbers from unsuspecting victims.</p><p>If terrorists start profiting from Internet scams, they could actually be the primary victims if a cyberterrorist attack succeeds in shutting down the Internet. Then maybe we'll see cyberterrorists terrorizing the old-fashioned, bomb-carrying terrorists.</p></div></div>

From these sites you can learn about different terrorist groups around the world, how they organize, what their goals may be, and how they typically launch an attack.</p><p>Most interesting is that none of these terrorist information sites mention how terrorist groups often evolve from hate groups to terrorists to political parties to ruling governments, as witnessed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and later, Hamas.</p><p>Perhaps the real threat of terrorism is that any terrorist group could get themselves elected as a "legitimate" government and further their objectives using military soldiers, instead of terrorists, to attack and kill innocent civilians. When this happens, anyone who supports the violence perpetrated by their government will be no better than the terrorists they so loudly condemn.</p></div></body></html>
