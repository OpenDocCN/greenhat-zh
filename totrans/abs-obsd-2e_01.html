You hold in your hands the ultimate repository of all OpenBSD wisdom and acumen, and once you complete it, you will be lord and master of all that OpenBSD offers. Right?</p><p>Sorry, no. No one book can possibly contain everything there is to know about OpenBSD. UNIX is pushing 40 years old, and BSD operating systems have been around for more than 30 years. OpenBSD itself is over 15 years old, and is built on decades of tradition, knowledge, and community development. You won’t master it with any single book. You might master it with a room full of books and a few years of study, if you stop wasting time on trivialities like having a family and avoiding scurvy.</p><p>The OpenBSD community maintains a wide variety of information sources. Some, such as the manual, are integrated with the OpenBSD operating system. The OpenBSD team maintains additional resources, such as the main OpenBSD website and the official OpenBSD mailing lists. Users and devotees maintain additional websites, mailing lists, and documentation. The flood of information can overwhelm experienced users and intimidate new users so badly that they don’t even try to sort through it. That’s why this chapter will take your hand and lead you through some of the other resources available.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.id325725" id="id325725">3</a>]</sup></p><div class="sect1" title="OpenBSD’s Support Model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="openbsds_support_model" style="clear: both">OpenBSD’s Support Model</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0062"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0065"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0422"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1573"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1617"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1619"/>If you’ve worked with only commercial UNIX, you might find OpenBSD’s support structure a little surprising. There is no toll-free number to call and no vendor to guide you. No, you may not speak to the manager of the support team. There isn’t one. The management is you.</p><p>Many commercial operating systems conceal their inner workings, and the only access you get is through the programs, application programming interfaces (APIs), and application binary interfaces (ABIs) they provide. If you want to learn more about how your operating system works, you can’t (unless you reverse-engineer it). When something breaks, you either live with it or pay the vendor to solve the problem.</p><p>OpenBSD, on the other hand, is completely open. You can view the source code, the compiler, and the resulting binaries. You have the official manual and a whole bunch of ancillary documentation. You have access to the developers’ logs—logs that describe every change ever made to every part of the system—through the same tools the developers use. You can back out of changes, understand the motivation behind the changes, and even contact the people who have most recently worked on a component you’re interested in and ask them what they were thinking. You can add your own features. In other words, you have the opportunity to understand OpenBSD in exquisite, excruciating detail.</p><p>If you want to learn about OpenBSD, you must jump from eating what you’re served to reading the cookbook and creating your own meals. If you’re willing to learn using the information provided, you will develop skills, and you’ll probably even make some friends in the OpenBSD community along the way. If you want to use OpenBSD and don’t have the time or inclination to learn, invest in a commercial support contract. Many companies and consultants around the world support OpenBSD. The OpenBSD website lists dozens.</p><p>If you don’t want to learn and don’t want to buy a support contract, then OpenBSD is simply not for you.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Code Is Fine. What’s Wrong with You?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="the_code_is_fine_whats_wrong_with_you" style="clear: both">The Code Is Fine. What’s Wrong with You?</h2></div></div></div><p>Systems administrators rarely have trouble with OpenBSD itself; the software runs, and it runs well. Most problems arise from their own understanding, or lack thereof.</p><p>When a program behaves unexpectedly, the problem is usually a gap in your expectations or understanding, and the OpenBSD community expects that you will work to improve your own knowledge so that you can make the system meet your needs. Other people make OpenBSD work correctly, and you can, too.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0208"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0513"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1304"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1603"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1605"/>That said, you may still find that a problem is quite real, but you can’t be certain that it was caused by OpenBSD itself until you understand correct behavior—not just how you think the system works, but how it really does work. The problem could be an OpenBSD bug, bad hardware, or an errant third-party tool. To correctly identify bugs, you must learn how the system should behave and why.</p><p>For example, before writing the first edition of this book. I had never used an OpenBSD machine to display a serial console. All of my Unix-like boxes had connections to a rusty old terminal server. Most people don’t have that many serial consoles, and they want to use a null modem cable between two OpenBSD machines and have each serve as the terminal for the others’ console. (We’ll cover serial consoles in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Boot Process">Chapter 5</a>.) From reading the manual page (discussed in the next section), this common configuration seemed simple enough: Attach the cables, configure one machine to dump its console to the serial port, become root on the display machine, and enter <span class="strong"><strong><code class="literal">tip tty00</code></strong></span>. The other machine’s console should have appeared in the terminal window, but that didn’t happen.</p><p>The next question is, “What’s wrong?” It might have been an OpenBSD bug, a hardware failure, or a gap in my comprehension. Swapping systems around demonstrated that the command worked on other OpenBSD machines, just not my particular test box. Further tests with a serial mouse and modem showed that the serial port on the test machine was bad.</p><p>Had the serial port been in working order, I might have actually found an OpenBSD bug, but probably not.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Sources of Information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="sources_of_information" style="clear: both">Sources of Information</h2></div></div></div><p>OpenBSD provides information through three primary channels: manual (man) pages, websites, and mailing lists. To understand why your system behaves in a particular way in your environment, you might need to check all three.</p><div class="sect2" title="Man Pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="man_pages">Man Pages</h3></div></div></div><p>Man pages are the original format for presenting documentation on Unix-like systems. While man pages have a reputation for being obtuse, difficult to read, or incomplete, the OpenBSD team expects its man pages to be readable, correct, and complete.</p><p>When man pages were first created, the average system administrator was a C programmer. As a result, man pages were written by programmers for programmers. The OpenBSD developers are programmers and consider man pages the final word in OpenBSD documentation. Even documentation errors are considered serious bugs and are dealt with as quickly as possible. Man pages should be your first line of attack in learning how OpenBSD works.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx1316"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1606"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2050"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2466"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2636"/>That said, a man page is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a tutorial. The manual explains how things work, not what to type to achieve particular effects. You must be able to assemble the knowledge offered by the man page into the tool that you need. If you want tutorials, read articles on third-party websites, the FAQ, and this book. If you find a tutorial that tells you how to do exactly what you want, read the relevant man pages along with the tutorial. Just remember that anyone can write a tutorial, and there’s no guarantee of any particular tutorial’s effectiveness or security.</p><div class="sect3" title="Manual Sections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="manual_sections">Manual Sections</h4></div></div></div><p>The OpenBSD manual has nine sections, and each man page appears in only one section. These sections are sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>volumes</em></span>, a name from the days when the manual was small enough to print and distribute. Each section covers a single topic. The sections are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>1: General commands</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>2: System calls and error numbers</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>3: C libraries</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>3p: Perl libraries</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>4: Device drivers</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>5: File formats</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>6: Games</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>7: Miscellaneous</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>8: System maintenance and management commands</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p>9: Kernel internals</p></li></ul></div><p>Man pages often appear with the section number in parentheses after the command, such as <code class="literal">ping(8)</code> or <code class="literal">ed(1)</code>. This gives you the name of the command (<code class="literal">ping</code>) and the section where the command is documented (8, on system maintenance).

NAME
     ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
SYNOPSIS
     ping [-DdEefLnqRrv] [-c count] [-I ifaddr] [-i wait] [-l preload]
          [-p pattern] [-s packetsize] [-T tos] [-t ttl] [-V rtable]
          [-w maxwait] host
DESCRIPTION
     ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit
     an ICMP ECHO_REPLY from a host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
     (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a "struct timeval"
     and then an arbitrary number of "pad" bytes used to fill out the
     packet. The options are as follows:
     -c count
             Stop sending after count ECHO_REQUEST packets have been sent. If
             count is 0, send an unlimited number of packets.
     -D      Set the Don't Fragment bit.

The command <code class="literal">apropos</code> searches for any man page name or description that includes the word you specify. The command <code class="literal">whatis</code> does the same search, but matches only whole words.

The random selection of entries shown here includes device drivers and user utilities, but no text editors. If you examine them closely, you’ll see that the letters <span class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> appear in each of them, encapsulated within words like <span class="bolditalic">vi</span><span class="emphasis"><em>deo</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>de</em></span><span class="bolditalic">vi</span><span class="emphasis"><em>ce</em></span>. Depending on what you’re looking for, <code class="literal">apropos</code> can offer you far too much information.</p><p>Try a similar search with <code class="literal">whatis</code>:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_id423616"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>whatis vi</strong></span>
ex, vi, view (1) - text editors</pre><p>Matching only whole words can be more useful.

For example, suppose someone mentions <code class="literal">sysctl</code> and you want to learn about it, so you search the man pages.</p><a id="I_programlisting1_id423655"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>whatis sysctl</strong></span>
sysctl (3) - get or set system information
sysctl (8) - get or set kernel state
sysctl.conf (5) - sysctl variables to set at system startup</pre><p>We have a <span class="emphasis"><em>sysctl.conf</em></span> file and two different man pages called <code class="literal">sysctl</code>. Manual section 3 is for C libraries. If you’re just learning about <code class="literal">sysctl</code>, you might find this man page intimidating.</p><p>By default, <code class="literal">man</code> displays the first matching page it finds. It searches commands first, then games, then programming libraries, then add-on programs such as Perl. You can change this search order in <span class="emphasis"><em>/etc/man.conf</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Everything /etc">Chapter 14</a>).</p><p>In this situation, manual section 3 is before manual section 8. Without specifying a section number, you’ll read about the programming interface. To see the man page for the system administrator command <code class="literal">sysctl</code>, you must run <code class="literal">man 8 sysctl</code>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Man Page Contents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="man_page_contents">Man Page Contents</h4></div></div></div><p>Manual authors try to arrange their content meaningfully, although meaningful varies depending on what it documents. A man page for a common user command will probably be much easier to understand than a man page for a kernel-programming interface. Even so, most man pages are divided into sections. Some of the common sections include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0210"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0409"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1317"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1424"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1623"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2078"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2294"/>NAME tells you the names of a program or utility. Some programs have multiple names; for example, the <code class="literal">vi(1)</code> text editor is also available as <code class="literal">view(1)</code> or <code class="literal">ex(1)</code>. The man page lists all of these names.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>SYNOPSIS lists the possible command-line options and their arguments, or gives examples for how programmers can call a library or interface. Once you’ve read the man page and used the command a few times, the synopsis might be enough to remind you of what you need.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>DESCRIPTION contains a brief synopsis of the program or feature. You’ll also find detailed discussions of the command-line options.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>BUGS describes known failure conditions and weird behavior, and generally discusses when a feature doesn’t work as you might expect. Always look at the BUGS section; it can save you a lot of time. I’ve frequently had a problem with a command only to find that the behavior, and sometimes a work-around, is listed here. Honesty is a wonderful thing in computing products.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>SEE ALSO is traditionally the last section in a man page. OpenBSD is an interrelated whole, and every command has ties to other commands. In an ideal world, you would read every man page and be able to hold an integrated image of the system in your head. Because most of us can’t do this, this section directs you to related man pages.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Man Pages on the Web"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="man_pages_on_the_web">Man Pages on the Web</h4></div></div></div><p>The man pages are also available on <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/" target="_top">http://www.OpenBSD.org/</a></em></span> and its various online mirrors. One of the interesting things about the web-based man pages is that you can look at them for both previous releases and for other architectures. Do you want to know if there’s a difference between the <code class="literal">sysctl</code> command for i386 and Loongson hardware? The web versions will let you compare two different man pages.

If you’re familiar with that package, you can access the mailing lists at <span class="emphasis"><em>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</em></span>.</p><div class="sect3" title="Unofficial Mailing Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="unofficial_mailing_lists">Unofficial Mailing Lists</h4></div></div></div><p>You can find a fairly complete list of all OpenBSD-related mailing lists hosted by third parties at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/mail.html" target="_top">http://www.OpenBSD.org/mail.html</a></em></span>. This includes lists in languages other than English.</p><p>One unofficial list, run by an OpenBSD developer, is the PF mailing list, for users of the OpenBSD packet filter. This list is for all PF packet filter users, not only OpenBSD, but OpenBSD users dominate the list. If you want to learn more about PF, subscribe to this list. You can find more at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.benzedrine.cx/" target="_top">http://www.benzedrine.cx/</a></em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Read-Only Mailing Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="read-only_mailing_lists">Read-Only Mailing Lists</h4></div></div></div><p>So <span class="emphasis"><em>misc@OpenBSD.org</em></span> looks like the mailing list for you, and you subscribe. If you race ahead and ask all your questions, you’ll immediately accomplish a couple things: You’ll alienate the community, and you’ll be told to shut up and go away; you certainly won’t make friends. That’s mainly because the mailing lists exist to be read more than posted to.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0072"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0312"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1272"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1315"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1614"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2041"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2647"/>Unless you’re in a truly unique situation or really on the bleeding edge of OpenBSD development, more likely than not, someone has struggled with your problem previously. That person probably got an answer, and that answer probably hasn’t changed. The quickest and least intrusive way to answer your question is to find that previous message. That’s where the mailing list archives come in.</p><p>Your favorite search engine has already indexed the OpenBSD mailing list. Always ask the search engine your question before going anywhere near the mailing lists. If you’ve looked around and found that your question is truly unique, send a message to the mailing list. But when you’re first starting out, you’re better off treating the OpenBSD mailing lists as read-only.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Using OpenBSD Problem-Solving Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="using_openbsd_problem-solving_resources" style="clear: both">Using OpenBSD Problem-Solving Resources</h2></div></div></div><p>Let’s pick a common question and use the OpenBSD resources to solve it, without resorting to sending mail. One of the things OpenBSD is known for is its support for cryptography in hardware. How does that work, and what does OpenBSD do to support it? Here’s how I would search for information on this topic from each information source the OpenBSD Project provides.</p><div class="sect2" title="Using the OpenBSD Website"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="using_the_openbsd_website">Using the OpenBSD Website</h3></div></div></div><p>Look at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/" target="_top">http://www.OpenBSD.org/</a></em></span> and you’ll see a link to Crypto. This takes you to the Cryptography page, which covers OpenBSD’s cryptography support. It includes algorithms and discusses how the team has integrated OpenSSL into hardware cryptographic accelerators. Read, learn, and enjoy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Man Pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="using_man_pages">Using Man Pages</h3></div></div></div><p>Let’s try running <code class="literal">apropos cryptography</code>:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_id424406"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>apropos cryptography</strong></span>
RSA_public_encrypt, RSA_private_decrypt (3) - RSA public key cryptography</pre><p>This man page isn’t terribly useful as a general overview, and <code class="literal">whatis cryptography</code> doesn’t return anything.</p><p>Cryptography is often referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>crypto</em></span>. <code class="literal">apropos crypto</code> gives too many results. <code class="literal">whatis crypto</code> gives more reasonable results:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_id424439"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>whatis crypto</strong></span>
crypto (3) - OpenSSL cryptographic library
crypto (4) - hardware crypto access driver
crypto (9) - API for cryptographic services in the kernel</pre><p>This is a fairly short list, and all the entries look promising. Manual section 3 is for programmer interfaces, section 4 is for device drivers, and section 9 is for the kernel. If you’re specifically looking for hardware cryptographic accelerators, section 4 should jump out at you, but start wherever you feel most comfortable.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Internet Searches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="using_internet_searches">Using Internet Searches</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0076"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1081"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1271"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2039"/>Go to your favorite search engine and search for “OpenBSD crypto hardware support.” On the day I wrote this, the first result led me to the official page on the OpenBSD website. The second hit was a paper on the OpenBSD cryptographic framework. You’ll find old articles, archived mailing list discussions, man pages, tutorials, and innumerable blog posts. You’ll probably need to add the model number of a particular cryptographic accelerator card to reduce the results to a manageable number.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Mailing Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="using_mailing_lists">Using Mailing Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>If the mailing list archives, a web search, the OpenBSD FAQ, the OpenBSD website, the integrated manual, and other assorted resources do not answer your question, you can ask for help. A variety of highly knowledgeable and very skilled computing professionals read the OpenBSD mailing lists. Many of these people enjoy working with OpenBSD and want to help intelligent new users. In their minds, “intelligent” equates to “not asking a question that has been asked before.”</p><p>Have another look at all the ways we gathered information on OpenBSD’s cryptographic hardware accelerator support in the previous section. Information about most other topics is just as readily available. People who take the time to read and answer questions on the OpenBSD mailing lists have already spent considerable time and energy creating this content and ensuring its accuracy. Now imagine their reaction when someone asks about cryptographic accelerator support on the public mailing list. Most OpenBSD experts will assume any of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The person wants their hand held.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The person is unwilling to read the documentation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The person has nothing but contempt for the OpenBSD developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The person has the intelligence of a brick.</p></li></ul></div><p>Most OpenBSD experts would conclude that the person asking the question simply isn’t ready to run OpenBSD. At best, the questioner will be ignored. At worst, some experienced OpenBSD person who wrote all this documentation will take offense at his hard work being so thoroughly discounted and flame the questioner badly enough that his monitor will need three months in the Mayo Clinic burn unit.</p><p>Keep this in mind before you send an email. Have you really checked everywhere for an answer? Are there any other search terms you haven’t tried? Performing a few extra searches with different keywords is much faster than composing a useful email, and there’s an excellent chance you’ll find the answer to your question.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0542"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0961"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2260"/>If you’re familiar with other free Unix-like operating systems, OpenBSD’s mailing lists might give you a bit of a culture shock. OpenBSD users are advanced computer users almost by definition. If an experienced systems administrator tries to debug a piece of software, that administrator is expected to know enough to ask the responsible party. If you go to a Linux forum, you’ll find people discussing server and client programs, desktop environments, and dang near any other piece of software that runs on that platform. Those forums are manned by volunteers dedicated to providing around-the-clock support and extreme efforts to help their operating system conquer the world.</p><p>The OpenBSD folks don’t care if they take over the world or not. They don’t really care if you use their software. If other people can get use out of it, that’s great. If not, oh well. They will happily assist you with OpenBSD-specific problems, but they don’t really care about your database issues or your website. If you’re having trouble porting your preferred window manager to OpenBSD because of some subtle bug in OpenBSD’s <code class="literal">libc</code>, the OpenBSD people would love to talk to you. If you can’t configure your window manager the way you like, then you should talk to the window manager support group instead.</p><div class="sect3" title="Creating a Good Help Request"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="creating_a_good_help_request">Creating a Good Help Request</h4></div></div></div><p>Before you send an email, think carefully about the problem you’re trying to solve. What question should you actually be asking? Define the issue as narrowly as possible. Suppose you cannot connect to a virtual private network (VPN) server with OpenBSD’s IPsec client. Is the problem that you can’t actually reach the IPsec server? Does the connection work when you turn off your OpenBSD firewall, but return when you re-enable filtering? Does <code class="literal">isakmpd(8)</code> crash and leave a core file every time you try to start the VPN? Each of these is a very different problem. Including the precise problem in your email will get you a better reception.</p><p>The first paragraph of your email should state your problem briefly and succinctly. If your first paragraph doesn’t contain enough to interest people, they’ll probably delete the email before getting to anything relevant.</p><p>After that important first paragraph, gather any and all information related to the problem. Include this information in your email. This should include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The version of OpenBSD you are running</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Your hardware platform</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Any error output (be sure to check <span class="emphasis"><em>/var/log/messages</em></span> as well as your terminal)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The contents of <span class="emphasis"><em>/var/run/dmesg.boot</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A complete but narrow problem description</p></li></ul></div><p>Give your email message an appropriate subject. A subject like “Problem with OpenBSD” will get ignored. A subject like “Reproducible isakmpd crash on newest OpenBSD snapshot” will immediately attract attention. Many OpenBSD people decide which messages to read based entirely on the subject line. Moderately advanced email-reading programs allow the recipient to delete an entire thread of discussion based on the subject line or message headers.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="How to Be Ignored"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="how_to_be_ignored">How to Be Ignored</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0220"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0541"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0545"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx0989"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1382"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2140"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx2411"/>Many senior OpenBSD users use a text-based email reader such as Mutt (although quite a few do use more graphic email readers, mind you.) Text-based email programs are very powerful programs for handling thousands of emails a day, but they show only text, and they do not display HTML messages well. If you are using a graphic mail client such as Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook, wrap your text at 72 columns. Sending mail in pure HTML or without readable line wrapping invites experienced recipients to discard it unread.</p><p>This might seem harsh, and it’s definitely different from mailing lists run by other open source operating systems. But most email clients are not suited to handle thousands of messages in a day, scattered across dozens of mailing lists, with several parallel discussion threads each, in a manner accessible to the human mind. I receive thousands of email messages a day, and I know many OpenBSD developers get—and process—even more. We simply cannot cope without mail tools that address our problems. HTML support is not nearly as necessary as the ability to manage, present, and process a large number of messages in a sensible manner.</p><p>On a similar note, most email attachments are unnecessary (and several of the OpenBSD mailing lists will unceremoniously strip them from incoming messages). You do not need to PGP sign your email, and those business card attachments just demonstrate that you really shouldn’t be running OpenBSD. If you include a signature in your email, it should be no longer than four lines. Long ASCII art signatures, even really nifty ones featuring the OpenBSD blowfish, are right out.</p><p>It’s easy to let frustration turn a simple request into a rabid demand for immediate assistance. Remember to be polite; the people who receive your message might decide to help you, but they’re under no obligation to do so. If you want someone to be obliged to help you, buy a support contract.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Sending Your Email"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="sending_your_email">Sending Your Email</h4></div></div></div><p>Before sending your email, double-check your search engine. Are you <span class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> this hasn’t been asked before?</p><p>Send all of your information and your narrow, specific, documented question about the OpenBSD core system to <span class="emphasis"><em>misc@OpenBSD.org</em></span>. Yes, OpenBSD has many other mailing lists, and some of them might look more appropriate for your problem, but people who post to them are almost always told to go ask on <span class="emphasis"><em>misc@</em></span> instead. People on <span class="emphasis"><em>misc@</em></span> might refer you to another mailing list, but it’s much better to post a message to a specific list if that message starts with “So-and-so on <span class="emphasis"><em>misc@</em></span> recommended that I ask this here.” If you have a narrow, specific, well-documented question about a piece of add-on software (or package, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Software Management">Chapter 13</a>), you can send it to <span class="emphasis"><em>ports@OpenBSD.org</em></span> instead.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Responding to Email"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="responding_to_email">Responding to Email</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx0544"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx1965"/>The response you receive might be a brief note with a URL, or even just the words “man such-and-such.” If that’s what you get, that’s where you need to go. Remember that you’re asking because you don’t understand something, and these responses tell you where to learn the answer to your question. Don’t just email back asking someone to hold your hand.</p><p>If you don’t understand the reference you’re given, treat that as another problem. Narrow down the source of your confusion. Man pages and tutorials are not perfect, and some parts might seem mutually exclusive or contradictory if you don’t fully comprehend them.</p><p>Finally, follow through. If you’re asked for more information, provide it. If you don’t know how to provide it, treat that as another problem. Go back to the beginning of this chapter and try to figure it out. If you develop a reputation as someone who doesn’t follow up on requests for more information, you won’t even get a first reply.</p><p>Now let’s get ready to actually install OpenBSD.</p></div></div></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.id325725"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#id325725">3</a>] </sup>Yes, the first chapter in this book is about getting help outside the book.
