Wi-Fi is a convenient alternative to conventional wired networks because any wireless-enabled computer within range of the Wi-Fi signal can join the network; there's no need to find a network outlet. This can be particularly useful when it's not practical to pull data cables through walls, ceilings, and floors, and when a user wants to connect a laptop computer or a handheld device such as an iPhone or BlackBerry to an existing network or through a LAN to the Internet. And of course, thousands of Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces such as airports, coffee shops, libraries, and schools offer easy access to the Internet when you're away from your own home or office.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0762"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0763"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0764"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0765"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0766"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0767"/></p><p>However, Wi-Fi connections are far less secure than wired networks, because the same data that moves between a computer and a base station by radio can be intercepted by another computer. Even if the data is encrypted, a dedicated intruder with enough time can steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. However, the latest security tools, including WPA encryption and virtual private networks (VPNs), can go a long way toward making a Wi-Fi network secure.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0768"/></p><p>This chapter describes the types of Wi-Fi networks and explains how to add a Wi-Fi hotspot to your LAN, how to select and use a Wi-Fi network interface with your computer, and how to keep your Wi-Fi network as secure as possible.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0769"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="types_of_wi-fi_networks"/>Types of Wi-Fi Networks</h1></div></div></div><p>Wi-Fi networks use the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.11 family of standards to define the radio frequencies, data formats, and other technical details that are necessary to establish a wireless LAN.

Walls, furniture, and other objects between the two antennas can all reduce the signal strength. 802.11b networks were the first to appear, and they were the most common type until the faster 802.11g version became available. 802.11a uses different radio frequencies, but many network adapters are compatible with both 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz access points. Today, the new 802.11n standard is beginning to replace all three older versions.</p><p>The three systems that use channels in the 2.4 GHz frequency band are backward compatible. In other words, if your Wi-Fi network interface adapter uses 802.11b only, it will continue to work with an 802.11g or 802.11n base station; both 802.11b and 802.11g adapters will work with an 802.11n base station.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The missing letters—802.11c, d, e, and so forth—describe other wireless data characteristics and enhancements that apply to wireless data networks.

Most often these systems use a proprietary method that involves two or more parallel channels to increase their data-handling capacity. Enhanced systems usually work as advertised, but only when the adapter and access point were both made by the same company. When you're building a wireless network that will use network adapters made by different manufacturers, or if you plan to allow users of laptops and other portable devices to connect to your network, there's not much benefit to having an enhanced network.</p><p>The Wi-Fi Alliance (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">http://www.wi-fi.org/</a>), the industry group that promotes these networks, conducts periodic "bake-offs" where many manufacturers demonstrate that their products will work correctly with equipment made by their competitors.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="operating_channels"/>Operating Channels</h1></div></div></div><p>Wi-Fi uses a segment of the radio spectrum (also called a band) near 2.4 GHz that has been reserved for unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) services, including wireless data networks. 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n all use this band of frequencies. 802.11a uses a different frequency band near 5.2 GHz known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0785"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0786"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0787"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0788"/></p><p>Both the ISM and U-NII bands are open to many kinds of unlicensed radio services. This means that the people who make the equipment must demonstrate that their designs meet various regulations related to maximum power, interference, and so forth, but actual users (that's you and me) don't need to obtain licenses before they can operate approved radios. One result of this is that the same radio frequencies used by Wi-Fi networks are also filled with signals from cordless telephones, medical equipment, radio-controlled toys, and microwave ovens, among many other things. Wi-Fi and those other devices use different methods to transmit and receive radio signals, so there's not much danger that the Wi-Fi adapter in your laptop computer will cause a model-train wreck or cause your cordless phone to ring. However, other ISM or U-NII signals, along with Wi-Fi signals from other nearby users, can add noise to your Wi-Fi signal that reduces the network's data transfer speed.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0789"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0790"/></p><p>Within the 2.4 GHz band, there are 14 overlapping Wi-Fi radio channels. Japan is the only major country that uses all of them. Only 11 of those channels are used in North America and China, while most of Europe uses 13 channels. In France, only 4 channels are available. Each channel operates on a different frequency, numbered from Channel 1 to Channel 14.</p><p>Each channel overlaps the two channels above it and two below it, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#wi-fi_signals_use_11_separate_overlappi" title="Figure 8-1. Wi-Fi signals use 11 separate overlapping channels. Notice that channels 1, 6, and 11 do not interfere with each other.">Figure 8-1</a>, so the channels with adjacent numbers can interfere with one another. Like the interference from other ISM devices, adjacent-channel interference can create a slower, noisier connection. Therefore, when you're setting up a new network or adding an access point to an existing network, it's best to choose a channel number as far away from the channels used by nearby networks as possible.</p><div class="figure"><a id="wi-fi_signals_use_11_separate_overlappi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e6419"/><img alt="Wi-Fi signals use 11 separate overlapping channels.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="access_points"/>Access Points</h1></div></div></div><p>Every Wi-Fi network must have at least one access point. Wi-Fi access points, or base stations, are radio transmitter/receivers (<span class="emphasis"><em>transceivers</em></span>) that send and receive data by radio and exchange that data with a wired Ethernet network. You can think of an access point as a router between a Wi-Fi network and a wired LAN.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0791"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0792"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0793"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0794"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0795"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0796"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0797"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0798"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0799"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0800"/></p><p>Most access points have one or two short antennas attached to the back panel; some also have a connector that can mate with a cable from a separate antenna. Separate antennas are useful because they can increase the access point's signal strength and sensitivity, but they're usually not necessary in small indoor home or small business networks. There's more about antennas later in this chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0801"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0802"/></p><p>Wi-Fi access points are often combined in a single unit with cable or DSL modems, gateway routers, or Ethernet switches. If your network includes both wired and wireless connections, you might want to consider a combined device, which is often less costly than two separate boxes. <a class="xref" href="ch08s03.html#this_wi-fi_access_point_doubles_as_a_ne" title="Figure 8-2. This Wi-Fi access point doubles as a network router.">Figure 8-2</a> shows a combined access point, Ethernet switch, and router.

Each access point should be connected to the wired portion of the network through an Ethernet hub or switch or, if that's not practical, through a wireless bridge that retransmits Wi-Fi signals on a different channel. In a Wi-Fi network with more than one access point, they should all use the same network name, but each one should use a different non-overlapping operating channel.</p><div class="figure"><a id="this_wi-fi_access_point_doubles_as_a_ne"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e6503"/><img alt="This Wi-Fi access point doubles as a network router." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266278.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 8-2. This Wi-Fi access point doubles as a network router.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Photo courtesy of D-Link</em></span></p></div>

Other manufacturers use different names, but the meaning is the same: If an adapter goes bad, or if you want to replace an older adapter with a new one that can handle new standards, it's relatively easy to remove the old card and install a new one in its place without changing the motherboard. This feature will be particularly convenient as and when the 802.11n standard becomes more common.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0813"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0814"/></p><p>It's important to turn off the Wi-Fi adapter when you're not using a network, in order to reduce battery drain and to avoid transmitting a signal that a hacker could use to link to your computer. There are usually several ways to turn an internal adapter on and off: a physical on/off switch, a set of keyboard commands, and an option in the Wi-Fi control program.

To install a PCI card, you must open the computer's case and insert the adapter into an unused expansion slot on the computer's motherboard—a considerably more complicated process than plugging in a PC card or a USB device.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0833"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0834"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0835"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0836"/></p><p>The only reason to consider using a Wi-Fi adapter on a PCI expansion card might be to add an old computer that has no USB ports to a wireless network. Even then, you could achieve the same result by installing an expansion card with several USB ports inside the computer and connecting a USB Wi-Fi adapter to one of those ports. That's probably the better approach, because it will also allow you to use other USB devices with the same computer.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="antennas"/>Antennas</h2></div></div></div><p>Every Wi-Fi adapter comes with either a built-in antenna or an antenna that plugs into a socket on the adapter's case. Some adapters include a built-in antenna <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a socket. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the antennas for a mini-PCI adapter in a laptop computer are usually built inside the top part of the computer's case, alongside the display panel.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0837"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0838"/></p><p>Unless you're trying to send and receive Wi-Fi signals over very long distances, the antenna supplied with your adapter should be all you need. Remember that a more powerful antenna might produce stronger incoming and outgoing signals, but those stronger signals often don't make any difference to network performance—once the signal strength reaches an adequate level, there's no advantage to adding more power or sensitivity.</p><p>The antenna used with an access point is a different story. If you install a "high gain" directional antenna or place the antenna as high as possible, the access point's coverage area will increase because radio signals at the frequencies that Wi-Fi uses are <span class="emphasis"><em>line of sight</em></span>, meaning that the signal can reach anywhere that an observer at the same location could see. However, the off-axis signals to or from a directional antenna are a great deal weaker because the antenna focuses most of its output (from a transmitter) or sensitivity (to a receiver) within a limited area. When you install a directional antenna, take the time to make sure the antenna is oriented for the best possible signal strength between the access point and the network interfaces.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0839"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0840"/></p><p>On the other hand, <span class="emphasis"><em>nondirectional</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>omnidirectional</em></span>) antennas have equal signal strength or sensitivity in all directions. The best way to provide Wi-Fi coverage over a wide area is to use an access point with a nondirectional antenna and either increase the height of the access point or antenna or use directional antennas on the network nodes located at the fringes of the access point's coverage area.</p><p>Many Wi-Fi adapters and access points use antenna connectors that are not the same as the standard cable connectors on antennas. In order to match the two, you must use a short cable adapter (not to be confused with a network interface adapter) called a <span class="emphasis"><em>pigtail</em></span>.

The obvious benefits of a wireless network connection—fast and easy access to the network from a portable computer or an isolated location—come at a cost. For most users, the convenience of wireless operation outweighs the possible security threats. But just as you lock the doors of your car when you park it on the street, you should take similar steps to protect your network and your data.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0902"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0903"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0904"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0905"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0906"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0907"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0908"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0909"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0910"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0911"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0912"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0913"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0914"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0915"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0916"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0917"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0918"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0919"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0920"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0921"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0922"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0923"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0924"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0925"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0926"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0927"/></p><p>The simple truth is that someone who wants to devote enough time and effort to monitoring Wi-Fi signals can probably find a way to intercept and read the data they carry. If you send confidential information through a wireless link, an eavesdropper can copy it unless the website or other host is using an end-to-end encryption scheme such as SSL. Credit card numbers, account passwords, and other personal information are all vulnerable.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0928"/></p><p>Encryption and other security methods can make data a little more difficult to steal, but they don't provide complete protection against a really dedicated snoop. An entire catalog of tools for cracking Wi-Fi encryption is easy to find on the Internet. As any police officer will tell you, locks are great for keeping out honest people, but serious thieves know how to get past them.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0929"/></p><p>There are two different kinds of security threats to a wireless network. The first is the danger of an outsider connecting to your network without your knowledge or permission; the second is the possibility that a dedicated eavesdropper can steal or modify data as you send and receive it. Each represents a different potential problem, and each requires a different approach to prevention and protection. Although none of the encryption tools currently available can provide complete protection, they can make life more difficult for most casual intruders. And as long as the tools are out there, you might as well use them.</p><p>A few techniques can discourage intruders and crackers. First, you can accept the fact that wireless networks are not completely secure and use the built-in network security features to slow down would-be intruders; second, you can supplement your wireless router's built-in tools with a hardware or software <span class="emphasis"><em>firewall</em></span> (or both) to isolate the wireless network (but remember that a cracker who can grab and decode encrypted network passwords can often grab firewall passwords too); and third, you can use additional encryption such as a <span class="emphasis"><em>VPN (virtual private network)</em></span> to make the network more secure.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0930"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0931"/></p><p>The security features of the early Wi-Fi protocols (WEP encryption) were not adequate to protect data. The WEP protocol was flawed in several ways. WEP should be treated more as a "Do Not Disturb" sign than as a real means of protection. The WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 standards attempt to fix the shortcomings of WEP, but they work only when all of the users of your network have modern cards and drivers.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0932"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0933"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0934"/></p><p>Here are some specific security methods:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use your access point's default SSID. Those defaults are well known to network crackers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change the SSID to something that doesn't identify your business or your location. An intruder who detects something called BigCorpNet and looks around to see BigCorp headquarters across the street will target that network. The same thing goes for a home network: Don't use your family name or the street address or anything else that makes it easy to figure out where the signal is coming from.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use an SSID that makes your network sound as though it contains some kind of fascinating or valuable content—use a boring name like, say, <span class="emphasis"><em>network5</em></span>, or even a string of gibberish, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>W24rnQ</em></span>. If a would-be cracker sees a list of nearby networks, yours should appear to be the least interesting of the lot.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change your access point's password. The factory default passwords for most access point configuration tools are easy to find (and they're often the same from one manufacturer to another—hint: don't use <span class="emphasis"><em>admin</em></span>), so they're not even good enough to keep out your own users, let alone unknown intruders who want to use your network for their own benefit. An unauthorized person (who could be one of your own children) who gets into the access point's software could lock you out of your own network by changing the password and the encryption key.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If possible, place your indoor access point in the middle of the building rather than close to a window. This will reduce the distance that your network signals will extend beyond your own walls.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use WPA encryption rather than WEP. WPA encryption is a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> more difficult to break, especially if it uses a complex encryption key.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0935"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0936"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change your encryption keys often. It takes time to sniff encryption keys out of a data stream; every time the keys change, the miscreants trying to steal your data are forced to start again from scratch. Once or twice every month is not too often to change keys in a home network. An office LAN should change keys at least once a week.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't store your encryption keys in plain text on the network where they are used. This seems self-evident, but in a widespread network, it might be tempting to distribute the keys on a private web page or in a text file. Don't do it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use email to distribute encryption keys. Even if you're not sending emails in plain text, an intruder who has stolen account names and passwords will receive the messages with your new codes before your legitimate users get them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If it's practical to do so on your network, turn on the access control feature in your access point. Access control restricts network connections to network clients with specified MAC addresses. The access point will refuse to associate with any network device whose address is not on the list. This might not be practical if you want to allow visitors to use your network, but it's a useful tool in a home or small business network where you know all of your potential users. MAC address filtering will not prevent a determined attacker from copying and spoofing the address of an authenticated user, but it could provide an additional layer of protection.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0937"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Turn on the security features, but treat the network as if it's completely open to public access. Make sure everybody using the network understands that they're using a nonsecure system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Limit file shares to the files that you really want to share; don't share entire drives. Use password protection on every share.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use the same firewall and other security tools that you would use on a wired network. At best, the wireless portion of your LAN is no more secure than the wired part, so you should take all the same precautions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use a firewall program on every computer connected to the network, including both wired and wireless nodes.</p></li></ul></div><p>It's important to take wireless network security seriously, but don't let the security issues discourage you from using Wi-Fi in your home or office unless you're moving very sensitive information through your network. If you protect your network with encryption and other security tools, you will probably keep all but the most determined hackers and crackers on the outside.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0938"/></p><p>On the other hand, if your small business handles customer billing information, credit card data, sensitive client or patient records, personnel data (such as Social Security numbers), or any similar information that should remain confidential, adding Wi-Fi to your LAN creates an extremely attractive target. If you must add Wi-Fi access to your small business network, use the strongest firewall you can find between the Wi-Fi access point and the other computers on the network.</p></div></body></html>
