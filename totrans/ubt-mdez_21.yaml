    your hands! You should be aware of a few notable exceptions, though. First, if
    a program is missing a feature, that’s not really a bug. You can still report
    it as a bug, but it probably won’t get much attention; try discussing it on the
    Ubuntu Forums first. Second, you shouldn’t ask for help with software by reporting
    a bug, since you probably won’t get a response. Use the forums, Ask Ubuntu website,
    or IRC instead; find out more on those in [The Ubuntu Forums](ch21.html#the_ubuntu_forums
    "The Ubuntu Forums") in [The Ubuntu Forums](ch21.html#the_ubuntu_forums "The Ubuntu

    Bean Business?](ch21.html#whatas_all_this_bean_business_question "What’s All This
    Bean Business?"). Finally, it’s important that the bug be *reproducible*. This
    means that you can provide a set of instructions for someone else to follow, and
    they will experience the same problem as you. Sometimes computers just do one-off
    weird things, and if the problem’s not repeatable, there’s little chance that
    it can be identified and fixed.

    of bugs isn’t easy to cope with, and dealing with them has been likened to “drinking
    from a fire hose.” To calm the chaos, an army of volunteers called the Bug Squad
    pore over all the new bugs, categorizing them, identifying ones that have already
    been reported, asking for details on how the bugs happen, and generally trying
    to get enough information together for a developer to be able to swoop in and
    fix the issue. In practical terms, this means it can take quite a while for a
    problem to be fixed, although the actual timescale will depend on how important
    the bug is judged to be. I normally reckon on waiting two to three months for
    an “average” bug. Having said that, my Rhythmbox bug hasn’t been fixed yet—five
    years later! (To be fair, it was a particularly minor problem that few people
    are ever likely to experience.)

    other forum users can read and respond to publicly. There are thousands of forums
    on the Web, bringing together people from all over the world to talk about all
    sorts of stuff. The Ubuntu forums are a great place to ask questions, get help,
    and converse with other people using Ubuntu. There are around 50,000 active users,
    and more than a million posts have been made to date. If you do have a question,
    there’s a good chance that it’s already been answered somewhere or that someone
    will be able to answer it for you.

    computer problems will post their questions in one of the Main Support categories,
    for example. For now, let’s check out the part of the forum set aside for new
    Ubuntu users. Click the **Absolute Beginner Talk** link and scroll down to the
    bit that says *Sticky Threads* ([Figure 21-9](ch21.html#viewing_the_sticky_threads_in_the_absolu

    the forum moderators (the head honchos who make sure everything runs smoothly)
    deem important enough that it should stick around permanently, for everyone to
    read. Normal threads don’t stick around and slowly make their way down the list
    as new threads are started and added to the top. To read a thread, just click

    Although it’s not as established as the Ubuntu forums and doesn’t have the same
    friendly community chitchat, it’s a useful place to go if you’re trying to answer
    a specific question or solve a problem. You can check it out by visiting [http://www.askubuntu.com/](http://www.askubuntu.com/).

    running down the page, ranked by their number of “votes.” Users of the site ask
    questions, which other users can then vote up or down in importance. The most
    important, interesting questions, as determined by the community, bubble up to
    the top of the list, get the most attention, and are thus more likely to get answered.
    You may have seen a similar sort of system in place on news websites and sites
    like YouTube; insightful comments receive lots of votes and appear at the top
    of the list, whereas less useful comments are buried further down the page.
  prefs: []

    possible solutions. Some of these are marked as “answers,” which directly propose
    a solution to the question. Other users can vote answers up or down, so the best
    answer will (in principle) also bubble to the top. All in all, Ask Ubuntu is an
    efficient way of getting the information you need if you have a specific problem
    or question. If you’re not sure exactly what you’re looking for, however, the
    Ubuntu Forums are probably a better bet.

    that you should look out for is Ubuntu Open Week, where all of the Ubuntu teams
    hold talks and tutorials on IRC. Check out [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/)
    to see when the next one will be.'

    right thing for you in the first place, you might like to try out a fun new app
    called Ubuntu Accomplishments ([Figure 21-15](ch21.html#gain_a_sense_of_achievement_by_finding_w
    "Figure 21-15. Gain a sense of achievement by finding ways of contributing to
    Ubuntu.")). Intended to help you find a way to get involved with Ubuntu, it works
    a bit like a game. You start out by completing one or two relatively simple community-oriented
    tasks, like getting a Launchpad account (as you already learned how to do in “Launchpad:
    Your Passport to the Ubuntu Community”). For each task you complete, you’re awarded
    a trophy (a digital one, mind; don’t expect any engraved plaques through the mail),
    so you can flaunt your achievements. As you earn more trophies, other “levels”
    are unlocked, giving you access to more tasks that can earn you even more trophies.
    Each task comes with instructions on how to complete it, so you learn how things
    work as you go. In the process, you explore the Ubuntu community, contribute to
    it a little, and have some fun at the same time. And even if you ultimately decide
    that contributing to Ubuntu isn’t your cup of tea, you’ll at least be left with
    a trophy or two for your troubles.'

    It’s still in development as this book goes to press, so there are a few rough
    edges here and there. In particular, some of the tasks seem quite technical in
    nature. But it’s still worth trying it out—go get those trophies!
