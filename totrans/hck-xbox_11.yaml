    to the dedication and contributions of hackers around the globe, the Xbox-Linux
    project has had a great deal of success toward meeting its goals. A picture of

    members. (The homepage for the Xbox-Linux project is http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net.)
    Significantly, the Xbox-Linux project and its principle hackers are not anti-Microsoft.
    They are pro-“freedom to tinker,” and not puerile Microsoft-haters; they have
    an agenda that touches upon preserving the very freedoms of thought and speech
    that brought technology to where it is today.

    development environment to the Xbox enables a larger base of software hackers
    to join the Xbox hacking project. With GNU/Linux, the Xbox can run a wide variety
    of application software, from free open-source video games to word processing
    applications to clustering software for building Beowulf-style computer clusters.

    10 describes methods for building and installing an alternate firmware device
    for the Xbox via the LPC interface. Several vendors now offer easy-to-install
    LPC interface alternative firmware devices. Notably, the Xodus/Matrix device is
    the first alternative firmware device on the market with an entirely solderless
    installation procedure. All the tools you need to install the Xodus/Matrix device
    are described in Chapter 1, “Voiding the Warranty,” and the Xodus/Matrix device
    itself comes with some easy-to-follow instructions on how to program and use the
    alternate firmware device.

    know the “SEGA CD” has three CPUs, one Z80 and two M68000?). That’s why I bought
    many video game systems for experimentation, such as the Nintendo SNES, the SEGA
    Genesis, and the Nintendo Game Boy. I also had a look at Linux for the SEGA Dreamcast,
    but I have never seen Linux for the Sony Playstation 2, since the whole set was
    really too expensive for me, both for experimentation and for real use.

    it with a ROM image that boots the GNU/Linux kernel. “Cromwell” is an open-source,
    clean-room (i.e., contains no Microsoft code) boot ROM for the Xbox that is capable
    of booting GNU/Linux. Significantly, the information contained in the Cromwell
    source code and binary image cannot be used to bypass any of the native copyright
    control mechanisms built into the Xbox. In other words, it is difficult to argue
    that Cromwell is any kind of copyright control circumvention tool. (Cromwell can
    be downloaded from the Xbox-Linux website on the Sourceforge.net server at http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After burning the Cromwell ROM to your alternate firmware device and installing
    the device in the Xbox, you will need to burn onto CD/RW media a GNU/Linux install
    image that you can download from the Xbox-Linux website (again, http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net).
    This install image comes as a fairly hefty (100+ MB) *ISO image,* compressed using
    bzip2, and it contains al of the software, interfaces, and tools necessary for
    getting a user-friendly GNU/Linux distribution up and running on the Xbox. When
    burning this ISO image, you must use the burn image option in the CD burner software.
    Do not copy the ISO image onto the CD as a single large file. (ISO images are
    literal bit patterns for a CD, so an ISO image already contains a complete filesystem
    description. Burning an ISO image as a regular file, instead of as an image, encapsulates
    the ISO image in a new filesystem, so the ISO just appears as a “bag of bits”
    instead of a filesystem with files.)

    This boot program comes as a smaller ISO image that should be available from the

    allows you to boot the Linux installation by simply dropping it into the Xbox,
    just like starting a game. (You can also copy the contents of this disk onto the
    hard drive using a third-party dashboard and boot Xbox-Linux directly from the
    hard drive if you prefer not to deal with a separate boot disk.)

- en: Burning a good CD/RW image is perhaps one of the trickiest parts of installing
    Xbox-Linux. The laser used inside the DVD-ROM drive of the Xbox is not well-suited
    for reading writeable CD media, so the Xbox is very finicky about the kind of
    media and the kind of burner as well as the burner settings used to create the
    CD image. Furthermore, the exact details of how the laser is degraded varies from
    Xbox to Xbox and is dependent upon the model of drive that happened to be installed.
    Users have found that few Xboxes can reliably read CD-R media, so CD/RW media
    *must* be used. In addition, it helps to burn the CD/RW media at the slowest burner
    setting using either a fresh, blank CD/RW, or a CD/RW that has been fully erased
    (as opposed to the quick erase that just resets the filesystem and does not actually
    destroy previously written data).

- en: Before committing to a particular type of CD/RW media, try using the regular
    Xbox Dashboard’s WMA ripping tools to copy the contents of a CD/RW that you burned
    with music to the hard drive. If this works reliably and without error, you can
    probably use that kind of CD/RW media for installing Linux. (Many Xbox-Linux installation
    problems have been traced to problems reading data off of the CD/RW drive.) At
    the time of this writing, there are no distributions available in hard-pressed
    CD-ROM media. There is some talk in the Xbox-Linux community of ordering a set
    of custom CD-ROM images, since this would solve many of the CD/RW headaches that
    users have been experiencing. (Also note that it is possible to install in your
    Xbox an after-market DVD-ROM drive that has better compatibility with writeable
    CD formats, as discussed in the previous chapter.)

    to find a way to install and boot Xbox-Linux without any hardware modifications.
    The Project B moniker comes from the criteria defined for the awarding of a $200,000
    prize offered by Michael Robertson, the CEO of Lindows. The “Project A” prize
    was $100,000 and it has been awarded to the first group to get Linux running on

- en: There are a number of Project B strategies being pursued by various groups.
    The most conceptually simple approach is to factor the 2048-bit RSA key used to
    sign Xbox game disks. This approach is being pursued by OperationProjectX (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opx)
    using a distributed computing approach. Simply put, if the 2048-bit RSA key is
    factored to reveal Microsoft’s private key, anyone can forge Microsoft’s digital
    signature and create bootable game disks for the Xbox, given that Microsoft never
    removes from the Xbox kernel the ability to load programs from regular CD or CD/RW
    media. Significantly, Microsoft ships its games on 2-layer DVD-9 format disks
    with special security structures. The Xbox firmware could be configured by Microsoft
    to only boot from disks that have this particular structure, regardless of the
    digital signature check. Since it is currently impossible to burn 2-layer DVDs
    using a common DVD burner drive, requiring secured DVD-9 media as the only source
    for executables would present an impairment to distributing Xbox-Linux through
    free downloads off the Internet. The other problem with this approach is that
    the chance of successful y factoring the Xbox’s private key through a brute force
    search is very, very small. (Chapter 7, “A Brief Primer on Security,” contains
    a sidebar on “Very Difficult Problems” that attempts to communicate the computational
    difficulty of this task.) If the private key is successfully recovered within
    a reasonable amount of time by this approach, it will significantly reduce people’s
    confidence in the RSA algorithm. (On the other hand, you can never win the lottery
    if you don’t buy a ticket, and running a free distributed factoring client using
    the spare cycles on your CPU is much cheaper than a Powerball ticket.)

- en: Another approach, related to cracking the RSA-2048 bit key, is to modify an
    existing, signed Xbox executable in a useful manner without changing its cryptographic
    hash value. Such a constructive hash collision would make the modified executable
    look identical to the original as far as the digital signature check is concerned.
    The hash used in the Xbox’s digital signature algorithm is SHA-1\. SHA-1 is a
    160-bit hash with no publicly known algorithmic weaknesses; since the source of
    the hash is fixed, about 2^(160) random variations would have to be tried to discover
    a collision. As a side note, you can’t use a birthday attack to reduce the difficulty
    of the attack to 280 random variations because we are not trying to find two messages
    that hash to the same arbitrary value. The goal is to generate a specific target
    hash, or perhaps one of a very limited set of target hashes harvested from the
    set of all published Xbox game titles. Hence, this approach also falls into the
    category of “Very Difficult Problems.”

    and use the holes to seize control of the CPU’s instruction pointer. To see how
    this is helpful, consider this example: Suppose a network-based buffer overrun
    exploit was discovered in a game that can lead to arbitrary code execution. A
    program running on a PC connected to the Xbox via the network could then use this
    exploit to send packets to the Xbox that would install a simple bootloader for
    Xbox-Linux. This bootloader could be something as simple as a program that runs
    code at a designated location on the Xbox’s hard drive or on the DVD drive. Any
    port where the Xbox can accept data is a vector for this kind of attack, including
    the USB and network port as well as the hard drive and the DVD-ROM drive.) Corrupted
    save games or file structures can be imaged onto the hard drive or DVD-ROM drive
    that cause the Xbox to run user-developed code. To Microsoft’s credit, all of
    the network interactions and save game protocols use fairly strong and well-tested
    security techniques. In addition, I heard at a presentation about the Xbox by
    Microsoft at MIT that all game code is inspected by a buffer overrun checker and
    that Microsoft has contractual remedies against game developers that are found
    guilty of putting deliberate back doors into their game code. This points to the
    Xbox code base being more secure than a typical Microsoft product, which makes
    it all the more interesting as a problem for hackers to work on. (If you are interested
    in participating in hacking on the Xbox as a part of “Project B,” I encourage
    you to first check out the Project B Prize Rules web page at http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/articles.php?aid=20030023081956.)'

    handled by Electronic Arts’ “007: Agent Under Fire” game. The exploit was first
    divulged by a hacker known simply as “habibi_xbox” on March 29, 2003 through a
    posting on the XboxHacker.net BBS. Significantly, the exploit was identified in
    an undisclosed number of games, but “007: Agent Under Fire” was the only game
    explicitly named in the posting. The exploit leverages an unchecked string to
    run a short segment (a few hundred bytes) of code that inserts a series of kernel
    patches. Various measures were included in the design of the hack to make it very
    difficult to modify the hack to do anything other than run the intended Xbox-Linux
    target. For example, the hack patches the original Xbox RSA public key, used for
    verifying digital signatures, with a new public key, while leaving the digital
    signature check algorithm unpatched. Only he Xbox-Linux bootloader, provided as
    part of the hack, is appropriately signed with the corresponding new private key.
    Other hackers would have to factor the new public key in order to use this hack
    to run other executables. Also, the “007: Agent Under Fire” game itself performs
    an independent digital signature check on al saved games, so modifying the exploit
    code in the hacked savegame file is not trivial. The inclusion of such security
    measures in the hack is a laudable decision on the part of the hack’s implementer,
    as it helps ensure that the hack is not directly useful for applications such
    as piracy. Implementing security measures that protect Microsoft’s interests may
    help save the Xbox-Linux project from the wrath of Microsoft and the U.S. Department
    of Justice.'

    also provided a console driver for Andy Green’s filtror device, so we were able
    to see the kernel boot messages and get a linux console by using his device as
    some sort of remote interface. This distribution already included network drivers,
    soundcard drivers, mp3 support, a telnet server, webserver, NFS support, and a

    form. The end result could either be a harsh crackdown by Microsoft upon all hacking
    activity, or Microsoft exiting the video game business altogether since their
    revenue stream would be cut off like Sega’s in the Dreamcast piracy debacle. Or,
    Microsoft could just elect to plow more money into the business and release a
    redesigned console that incorporates patches and countermeasures for known security
    holes. The outcome will depend heavily upon how events unfold in the next few
    months. However, with deep price cuts on the horizon for the Xbox and rumors of
    a thoroughly redesigned “shrink” version of the console floating around, it seems
    that Microsoft’s near-term strategy is to focus its energies on storming the market
    instead of stemming fair-use or piracy. After all, every Playstation2 or Gamecube
    sold probably has a worse effect on Microsoft’s business than every Xbox converted
    to run GNU/Linux, or even an Xbox converted to run pirated games.

    and MAME-X (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator for the Xbox), have been developed
    for the native Xbox gaming platform. Unfortunately, these programs were developed
    using unauthorized versions of the Microsoft Xbox SDK (Software Development Kit).
    Microsoft’s Xbox SDK is supposed to be available only to approved, licensed developers.
    However, the SDK was leaked even before the console was launched, and since then
    many have used the leaked Xbox SDK for creating their own Xbox programs. While
    the proprietary Xbox SDK is convenient and easy to use, it is also technically
    il egal to use. The lack of a legal SDK for the native Xbox platform makes it
    difficult to attract a large base of open-source developers.

    to the Xbox SDK. OpenXDK’s stated goal is to create a legal development kit for
    creating Xbox Executables (XBEs). OpenXDK wil al ow users to create native XBE
    files that, when signed with the appropriate digital signature, could run on a
    vanilla Xbox. Since this appropriate digital signature is as of yet unknown, this
    work is done in anticipation of a legal technology that enables interoperability
    with programs developed using the OpenXDK.

    for developers. More about the OpenXDK project can be found at http://openxdk.sourceforge.net.
    OpenXDK’s project managers are Dan Johnson (also known as SiliconIce, the creator
    of the XboxHacker BBS) and Aaron Robinson (also known as caustik; caustik is also
    leading the CXBX executable relinker and the CXBE Xbox emulator projects).
