    for help with any topic. We'll also explain ways in which community members interact
    with each other. Though most discussion occurs on talk pages, Wikipedia has some
    central community forums for debate about the site's larger policies and more
    specific issues. We'll also talk about the make-up of the community. First, however,
    we'll outline aspects of Wikipedia's shared culture, from key philosophies about
    how contributors should interact with each other to some long-running points of
    debate to some friendly practices that have arisen over time. Although explicit
    site policies cover content guidelines and social norms, informal philosophies
    and practices help keep the Wikipedia community of contributors together.

    been with the community since the beginning.

    philosophy, as well as an official guideline (shortcut WP:AGF) on Wikipedia. It
    can be summarized as: Unless you have strong evidence to the contrary, you should
    always *assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it*, not
    hurt it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming good faith means that if someone doesn't seem to be following policy,
    assume that he or she simply made a mistake rather than deliberately disrupted
    the encyclopedia; always give an editor the benefit of the doubt. The assumption
    that everyone involved simply wants to make the encyclopedia better leads to more
    constructive debates and helps foster harmony on the site. As part of this attitude,
    a user's reputation on another Web forum or project should not be used against
    him or her.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assume Good Faith is a good place to begin, but practicing it can be difficult.
    If an editor starts by apparently creating an article about him- or herself or
    his or her company, assuming this editor is primarily interested in general encyclopedia
    work is difficult; a tension exists between Assume Good Faith and Conflict of
    Interest. If an account is *single purpose*—that is, the editor only makes partisan
    edits in a small topic area—then assuming good faith is harder because promotional
    and activist editing is unwelcome. Vandalism is a fairly clear demonstration of
    bad faith and will usually result in short blocks. What Assume Good Faith means,
    however, is that you should first try to figure out an editor's intentions by
    engaging in discussion and informing him or her about policies. A single-purpose
    or disruptive editor might always broaden his or her contributions to the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please Don't Bite the Newcomers is the name of another guideline (shortcut WP:BITE)
    that focuses on the importance of being welcoming to newcomers. Obviously this
    guideline is compatible with Assume Good Faith. It encourages you to be gentle
    with newbies if you see them making mistakes. Encourage newcomers—you want them
    to keep contributing—and teach them about Wikipedia. We were all new once! A new
    editor's ignorance of some policy details is not surprising—what would be surprising
    would be to find someone new who has already mastered them all.

    or action followed from a reasonable position, consider refraining from reverting
    the edit. Does it matter that much? Different edits might be just as good for
    the encyclopedia, and not every decision should be treated as a point of principle.
    This aspect of the site may be one of the harder ones for the newcomer to appreciate.
    Because no one really directs Wikipedia, you should take a peaceful approach and
    assume that the community's good sense as a whole will prevail; reasonable people
    can agree to disagree.

    their talk page. Simply saying, "Hello, good work!" when you notice a helpful
    edit from a new contributor is encouraging. Many welcomers leave a more involved
    initial message, with links to help pages and more information about Wikipedia.
    The `{{welcome}}` template, if left on a talk page, is one example of such a message;
    editors may also code their own welcome messages, as we did in [Chapter 9](hw-wkpd-wk_11.html
    "Chapter 9. Images, Templates, and Special Characters"). A personal greeting is
    irreplaceable. A welcoming committee works on coordinating messages for new editors,

    to Wikipedia in February 2004\. Since then, the concept has become ingrained in
    Wikipedia culture. Barnstars are rewards for *hard work and due diligence*. The
    image used most commonly on Wikipedia is of a structural barnstar, a metal object
    used to help brace a wall, which relates to the wiki notion of *barnraising* by
    building a page together; see the article at [[Barnstar]] for more details.

    are hardly used at all to edit. But this freedom to join up and participate casually
    helps ensure that Wikipedia is an open community. Now open editing is not quite
    the same as easy editing, even with a friendly wikitext editing system. Wikipedia
    itself has become much more complex, as a first encounter might convince you.

    work. In a completely open system run by volunteers, why aren't more limits required?
    One answer is that Wikipedia uses the principle of soft security in the broadest
    way. Security is guided by the community, rather than by restricting community
    actions ahead of time. Everyone active on the site is responsible for security
    and quality. You, your watchlist, and your alertness to strange actions and odd
    defects in articles are part of the security system.

    differentiated itself from the older wiki tradition. Whereas wikis in general
    simply gathered opinions, Wikipedia aimed to build a factual reference resource,
    using notions of what was and wasn't encyclopedic. The concept of Verifiability
    became increasingly important, first as a criterion and then as a policy, and

- en: In 2007, attention turned back to deletionism because the net growth of articles
    seemed to have peaked (though outsiders were increasingly using Wikipedia for
    promotional ends by writing about themselves and their ventures). Although deletionism
    favors clear and relatively rigorous standards for accepting new articles, which
    are increasingly being adopted, inclusionism and the view that new articles should
    be given a chance have also continued to be major forces. Regardless, the inclusionist
    view that all processes are supposed to operate case by case rather than determining
    whether broad topic areas should be included continues to prevail, though this
    view is subject to great debate, especially in areas of popular culture.

    hybrid positions, too. For instance, the eventualist-deletionist position is that
    deleting articles that really don't improve over time is not a great loss, and
    if a startup company or new idea prospers, an article on it will be accepted in
    due course. The immediatist-inclusionist position is that Wikipedia's coverage
    suffers if an article on a new topic is deleted when it didn't have to be. ^([[27](#ftn.CHP-12-FNOTE-3)])

    a community made up of a bunch of people who think writing a free, complete, and
    accurate encyclopedia is a good idea (and a lot of fun, too). The Wikipedia community
    isn't too happy about people trying to use Wikipedia to promote causes other than
    having a good online encyclopedia. This includes contributions meant to promote
    websites and products, political causes, religions, and other beliefs, and of
    course one's personal view of what's really funny. (From [[Wikipedia:Don't hand

    a collection of observations on how Wikipedia works and how Wikipedians work together.
    The essay was started by User:Raul654, an experienced contributor, but has been
    built by dozens of contributors. The page gives what is very much an insider's
    view of how Wikipedia works, though the later laws that have been added vary greatly
    in interest.

    structure: Processes consist of decentralized discussions about separable issues.
    That''s how decisions are actually made and how site administration moves forward.
    Backlogs are avoided by limiting discussion time. These processes are, in turn,
    governed by policy documents that have general consent. ([Chapter 13](hw-wkpd-wk_16.html
    "Chapter 13. Policy and Your Input") picks up from here and will explain how you
    can have wiki-style *editable* policy.)'

    for editors to work together through discussion. So much needs to be done that
    the sensible approach that has evolved is to have all those differentiated processes,
    not a single executive body. Processes and policies, despite their imperfections,
    evolve to meet changing circumstances. See an overview essay [[Wikipedia:Product,
    process, policy]] (shortcut WP:3P) for more on this idea.

- en: Though loose and somewhat ill-defined, the notion of *community* is absolutely
    fundamental to Wikipedia; without it, the site could not succeed. The way Wikipedia
    is set up has led to a community that doesn't rely on central authority or a central
    forum. Instead, Wikipedia's editors communicate largely, but not exclusively,
    by editing pages for others to read—both article talk pages and central discussion
    forums. Those pages run quickly into tens of thousands of separate discussions,
    where issues are separated out and dealt with individually. Each debate will bring
    together a small, probably diverse group of people interested in any topic. Wikipedia
    has no true center and no easy overview of all these interactions. Wikipedia's
    success relies on the way that the overarching philosophies mesh with the intricate,
    small-scale actions on the site.
