- en: 'MediaWiki is an open source wiki implementation written in PHP (PHP: Hypertext
    Preprocessor). It utilizes a MySQL database to store content. Wikiwiki is a Hawaiian
    word meaning quick. In a technology sense, a wiki is a collaborative website where
    content is modified by users. MediaWiki currently powers Wikipedia, the popular
    free-content encyclopedia written by volunteers.'

- en: Wikis allow users the ability to co-author content on pages without the need
    for HTML skills or administrative privileges. Editing a MediaWiki page is simpler
    than editing a typical HTML page. This is made possible by the Wikitext format,
    which uses a simplified syntax and an easy-to-understand word processor-like toolbar.
    When the user submits an edit to a wiki page, MediaWiki saves the change along
    with the previous version. This allows for manual reversion, which is useful for
    fighting vandalism and correcting inaccuracies found by other users.

- en: The software now known as MediaWiki was nameless from its creation in January
    2002 until its public release in mid-2003\. Magnus Manske, a University of Cologne
    student, wrote it specifically for Wikipedia to replace the Perl-based UseModWiki
    engine. The program he developed stored content in a relational database (i.e.,
    MySQL) that provided more functionality than the traditional flat filesystem.
    Lee Daniel Crocker later rewrote the software to address scalability problems.
    Brion Vibber eventually took over as lead developer, and in mid-2003 the Wikimedia
    Foundation named the project MediaWiki and released the software to the public.
