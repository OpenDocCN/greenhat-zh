I don’t mean just desktop backgrounds and colors and display fonts but things like window borders too. You can even change the entire desktop environment if you’re so inclined.</p><p>For customization fans, however, one thing that is slightly disappointing about the Unity environment in Ubuntu is that it is not as easily customizable as others. The main way to give yourself total customization freedom is to actually get rid of Unity, which is delving into pretty geeky territory, but there are some things you can do without getting all that drastic. So, let’s just start off by discussing the easy tweaks you can do and then gradually work our way into a bit of minor geekdom for those of you who want to get down and a little (just a little) dirty.</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 9A: Creating a New User Account"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_9a_colon_creating_a_new_user_acc"/>Project 9A: Creating a New User Account</h1></div></div></div><p>If you’re reluctant to alter the look of your current setup, you can create a new user account and experiment with making the changes in this chapter when logged in to the new account.

If the purple world of Ambiance is not your thing, click any of the other wallpapers to immediately make a change. There are quite a few to choose from, but maybe you’d prefer to use some images of your own. These could be photos from a digital camera, works of art you created on your computer, or just about anything else you want to put there.</p><p>If you are going to venture out onto the Web, a number of sites provide free desktop wallpaper. Two sites specifically geared toward Linux users are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome-look.org/">http://www.gnome-look.org/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</a>, but you can get wallpaper from wherever you like. Astronomy Picture of the Day (<a class="ulink" href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html</a>) is a particular favorite of mine. Many company sites (cars, sodas, guitars, you name it!) have wallpapers available as well.</p><p>Once you’ve downloaded your wallpaper, move it from your <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> folder into your <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder. (You may want to create a <span class="emphasis"><em>Wallpapers</em></span> subfolder to keep things better organized, but that’s up to you.) After that, you can install the new image by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> button right below the wallpapers pane in the Appearance window. In the window that appears, navigate to your new wallpaper, click it once to highlight it, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>. The wallpaper will appear highlighted in the Appearance window and appear on the desktop within seconds.</p><p>Once the wallpaper shows up, you can adjust how it appears on the desktop with the little drop-down menu button just to the left of the + button in the Appearance window. Your choices are <span class="emphasis"><em>Tile</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Zoom</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Center</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scale</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Fill</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Span</em></span>.

If you click that button, you will see there are also three more themes: Radiance, High Contrast, and High Contrast Inverse. Slim pickings to be sure, but interesting enough. To see the effects, just try each of them out, and within a few seconds you will see how they look.

If you look at the bottom portion of the window, you can see a slider that allows you to change the size of these. The default size for the Launcher icons is 48×48, but you can shrink them to a very manageable 36×36 or puff them up to 60×60. Just move the slider, and the icons will change size. When you are satisfied, close the Appearance window.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Autohiding the Launcher"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="autohiding_the_launcher"/>Autohiding the Launcher</h2></div></div></div><p>There is yet one more customization you can perform from the Appearance window—autohiding the Launcher and setting the desktop hotspot you will use to make it appear again when you want it. To do this, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Behavior</strong></span> tab. In the Behavior tab (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#autohiding_the_launcher_and_setting_a_ho" title="Figure 9-6. Autohiding the Launcher and setting a hotspot to make it reappear">Figure 9-6</a>), switch on the on/off switch in the top-right corner of the window, select where on the desktop you want the reveal hotspot to be, and then use the slider at the bottom to determine how sensitive you want that hotspot to be. I would recommend choosing Left side and making the sensitivity rather high, because getting the Launcher to pop out of hiding can take some getting used to; the process just doesn’t have the same smooth feel as you might be used to in Windows or Mac. You kind of have to whack the cursor against the left side of the screen and then draw away gently. Well, you’ll get the hang of it, and when you do, you’ll find that it works just fine.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stretching Desktop Icons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="stretching_desktop_icons"/>Stretching Desktop Icons</h2></div></div></div><p>One more feature in your desktop environment is worth noting—stretchable icons. You can make individual desktop icons any size you want, which can be aesthetically pleasing. For example, you might stretch the thumbnail of a photo file so that it appears as desktop art or of a folder or file so that it is easy to find and open (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#desktop_icons_can_be_stretched_to_any_si" title="Figure 9-7. Desktop icons can be stretched to any size you want.">Figure 9-7</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="autohiding_the_launcher_and_setting_a_ho"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11461"/><img alt="Autohiding the Launcher and setting a hotspot to make it reappear" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263672.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-6. Autohiding the Launcher and setting a hotspot to make it reappear</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="desktop_icons_can_be_stretched_to_any_si"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11469"/><img alt="Desktop icons can be stretched to any size you want." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263674.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-7. Desktop icons can be stretched to any size you want.</p></div><p>To stretch a desktop icon, right-click the icon and select <span class="strong"><strong>Resize icon</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.

Compiz is the compositing engine at work in Ubuntu that provides it with its 3D effects, such as shadows and window animations. Its job is to bring together all the various elements at work in your system that create the graphical environment and then, in conjunction with your 3D–compatible video card, make everything seem to be working as one graphical unit. You might say it is the eye-candy engine for your system, and as such it is a busy bit of software indeed! CCSM is the graphical interface by which you can control Compiz’s features.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-9-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-9-0032"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="compizconfig_settings_manager"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11731"/><img alt="CompizConfig Settings Manager" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263696.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-18. CompizConfig Settings Manager</p></div><p>Compiz is automatically enabled at startup only if you have a graphics card that supports its basic set of features. An easy way to tell whether Compiz has kicked in on your machine is to open any window (your Home folder, for example) and check to see whether that window has a drop shadow. If it does not, then Compiz is not at work, and this section will not be of much use to you—skip to the next section. If it does have a shadow, however, Compiz is at work, so keep on reading.</p><p>The graphical effects that are active by default in your system are really the tip of the iceberg. Depending on the capabilities of your graphics card, you will get the drop shadows and a few other bells and whistles, such as cooler window-opening transitions, but that’s about it—on the surface, at any rate. If you like, you can get a feel for it right now by kicking the effects up a notch. First run CCSM by going to the Dash, clicking the Applications lens, and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Customization</strong></span> filter button and looking for it in the results shown. Or if you prefer, just type <strong class="userinput"><code>compiz</code></strong> in the Dash and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p><p>The very first thing you will see, along with the CCSM window, will be another window warning you that CCSM is an advanced tool and that you should proceed with caution. The warning is right, so if you’re not sure what something in CCSM is or does, then perhaps you shouldn’t fool with it. You should be safe trying out the things I mention here, however, starting out with <span class="emphasis"><em>Wobbly Windows</em></span>.</p><p>To give Wobbly Windows a try (and thus get a hands-on feel for CCSM), click the <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> button on the left side of the CCSM window and then in the next screen check <span class="strong"><strong>Wobbly Windows</strong></span>. In the screen after that, check the box next to the words <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Wobbly Windows</strong></span>. In the small window that then appears, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Disable Snapping Windows</strong></span> button. Now drag the -window around. As you will see, the whole thing will start wiggling like jelly when you move it—freaky and totally distracting, but kind of cool. You can uncheck the Wobbly Windows box if the feature is getting on your nerves.</p><p>Another interesting tool is the Annotate tool, which can actually have some practical uses as it allows you to write on the screen (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#the_compiz_annotate_tool_allows_you_to_w" title="Figure 9-19. The Compiz Annotate tool allows you to write on the screen.">Figure 9-19</a>).
