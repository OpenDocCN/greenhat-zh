- en: Many people hate to admit it, but games are a big attraction to almost everyone
    at the helm of a personal computer. Even those who deny being gamers often find
    themselves caught in the act of rapping off a quick round of solitaire between
    work projects. As a Linux user, you will most likely find that one of the most
    common questions you will be asked about Linux by users of other operating systems
    is, "What games does it have?" Well, although there might not be as many games
    in the Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose
    from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.

    trainers, and brain teasers, shown in [Figure 17-1](ch17.html#gbrainy "Figure 17-1. gbrainy")),
    Mahjongg (a tile-matching game, similar to the one introduced in [Chapter 9](ch09.html
    "Chapter 9. SIMPLE KITTEN WAYS")), Mines (the Linux world's answer to Minesweeper),
    Quadrapassel (a Tetris clone), and Sudoku. Many other free games are available

    hordes of aliens or crashing a high-powered sports car into a wall. Unfortunately,
    games designers have traditionally neglected Linux to concentrate on the significantly
    larger Windows market, so up until a couple of years ago there were few Linux-friendly

    Without hardware acceleration, your computer's processor has to try to do all
    of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn't designed),
    so your games end up running at a snail's pace, if at all. Most modern graphics
    cards have some hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is enabled
    will depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find out how
    good 3D support is for your graphics card at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/).

    In terms of gameplay, Nexuiz feels quite similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect
    a wide array of weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting
    at opponents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most deathmatch-style
    games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are other game
    modes, like "capture the flag." There's also an online multiplayer option if you're

    can build new units and send them to attack your foes. Your opponents are doing
    the same, however, so battles can turn into subtle tactical affairs, where your
    ability to launch successful attacks must be balanced against the limited availability

    there''s also a neat rockstar simulator called Frets on Fire ([Figure 17-15](ch17s02.html#frets_on_fire
    "Figure 17-15. Frets on Fire")). The gameplay is very much like Guitar Hero, but
    with one major difference: You use your keyboard to play notes rather than a guitar-shaped
    controller. However, if you don''t mind doing a little tinkering, you can get
    your Guitar Hero controller to work with Frets on Fire. (See [http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/using-guitar-hero-controller/](http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/using-guitar-hero-controller/).)
