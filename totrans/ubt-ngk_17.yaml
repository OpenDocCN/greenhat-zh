- en: Many people hate to admit it, but games are a big attraction to almost everyone
    at the helm of a personal computer. Even those who deny being gamers often find
    themselves caught in the act of rapping off a quick round of solitaire between
    work projects. As a Linux user, you will most likely find that one of the most
    common questions you will be asked about Linux by users of other operating systems
    is, "What games does it have?" Well, although there might not be as many games
    in the Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose
    from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.

    of more than 80 solitaire card games), gbrainy (a collection of puzzles, memory
    trainers, and brain teasers, shown in [Figure 17-1](ch17.html#gbrainy "Figure 17-1. gbrainy")),
    Mahjongg (a tile-matching game, similar to the one introduced in [Chapter 9](ch09.html
    "Chapter 9. SIMPLE KITTEN WAYS")), Mines (the Linux world's answer to Minesweeper),
    Quadrapassel (a Tetris clone), and Sudoku. Many other free games are available
    via the Ubuntu Software Center (and other sources), some of which you will learn
    about in this chapter.

    Sure, 2D games can be fun—I've certainly lost a significant portion of my life

    hordes of aliens or crashing a high-powered sports car into a wall. Unfortunately,
    games designers have traditionally neglected Linux to concentrate on the significantly
    larger Windows market, so up until a couple of years ago there were few Linux-friendly
    3D games to choose from. As the penguin has grown in popularity, however, people

    Without hardware acceleration, your computer's processor has to try to do all
    of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn't designed),
    so your games end up running at a snail's pace, if at all. Most modern graphics
    cards have some hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is enabled
    will depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find out how
    good 3D support is for your graphics card at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/).

    vertical line is the "pipe" symbol and can normally be inserted by pressing **shift**
    and \ on your keyboard.) If you get a message telling you that glxinfo isn't installed,

    In terms of gameplay, Nexuiz feels quite similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect
    a wide array of weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting
    at opponents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most deathmatch-style
    games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are other game

    part of the command string, `java`, calls the Java Runtime Environment into action;
    the `–jar` flag after that tells Java that you are going to be running a JAR file,
    which is what a Java script is called; and the last part is the actual file you
    are going to run, `Schnapsen.jar`. (In the future, if you choose to run other
    Java-based applications, just follow the same pattern: `java –jar` *`application_name`*`.jar`.)'

    know (diamonds, hearts, spades, and clubs) by going to the **Settings** menu and

- en: With all this talk of installing games, it's easy to forget that there are many
    games that you don't have to install at all. Numerous websites allow you to play
    games online for free, as long as you have the proper browser plug-ins installed.
    (See [Multimedia Plug-Ins](ch05.html#multimedia_plug-ins "Multimedia Plug-Ins")
    in [Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks](ch05.html#keeping_up-to-date_with_live_bookmarks
    "Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks") for help installing plug-ins.) For example,
    check out [http://www.popcap.com/](http://www.popcap.com/) and [http://gametrick.net/](http://gametrick.net/)
    for some great online time-wasters. You can also play any of the games found on
    Facebook or other social networking sites, such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, without
    ever leaving the comfort of your Ubuntu desktop.

    assured that they're out there. Some are available as DEB files, and can be installed
    in the same way you installed Skype in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. ROUNDING
    OUT THE BIRD"). A good example is SDL Hana, a Linux version of the Japanese flower
    card game Hanafuda ([Figure 17-19](ch17s05.html#sdl_hana "Figure 17-19. SDL Hana")),
    which is available from [http://savannah.nongnu.org/pr/sdlhana/](http://savannah.nongnu.org/pr/sdlhana/).

    attractive, underwater locations.'

    designed Yo Frankie! ([Figure 17-20](ch17s05.html#yo_frankie_exclamation "Figure 17-20. Yo
    Frankie!")), you play an evil sheep-throwing squirrel called Frank, who runs through
    idyllic landscapes being chased by unfriendly animals—kids (and aesthetes) will
    love it. You can also lose yourself in the Balazar role-playing game, with plenty
    of magic and monsters to keep you company; fly a space fighter in 4D in Adanaxis
    (yes, they managed to squeeze an extra dimension in there, sort of); and race
    go-karts, penguin-style, in SuperTuxKart ([Figure 17-21](ch17s05.html#supertuxkart
    "Figure 17-21. SuperTuxKart")).
