    totally without comments, thus giving all the programmers that followed a chance

- en: There is a contest held every year called the Obfuscated C Contest. The contestants
    try to figure out how to write the most difficult and hard-to-read program possible.
    After all, they're programmers, and they know programs hard to understand under
    the best of circumstances. This contest gives them a chance to understand a program
    under the worst of circumstances.
