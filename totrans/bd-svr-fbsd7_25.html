<p class="docText1"><a name="Drupal is" class="calibre8" id="Drupal is"/>Drupal is an open source web-based <span class="docEmphasis1"><a name="System " class="calibre8" id="System "/>Content Management System (CMS)</span><a name="be used" class="calibre8" id="be used"/>. Content management systems can be used to organize, store, and distribute various kinds of content, including web pages, images, audio, and documents. Modern CMS applications like Drupal make it relatively easy for users to add, remove, and modify content. This provides a viable platform for company intranet sites and even personal blogs. Drupal is written in PHP and stores content in a MySQL (or PostgreSQL) database.<a name="IDX-CHP-9-0152" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0152"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0153" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0153"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0154" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0154"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0155" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0155"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0156" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0156"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0157" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0157"/><a name="IDX-CHP-9-0158" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0158"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="include role" class="calibre8" id="include role"/>Some of Drupal's features include role-based permissions, a template/theme system, version control, and built-in site analytics. It also has a powerful module/plug-in system that allows third-party developers to extend the default feature set. If you need functionality that isn't included with Drupal's default feature set, it is probably available as a module.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="the University" class="calibre8" id="the University"/>Early Drupal development began in 2000 when Dries Buytaert, a student at the University of Antwerp, built a web-based bulletin board system that he and his friends used to share notes. After graduation, Buytaert continued to add features, and in 2001, he released Drupal as an open source project. Drupal's popularity has increased steadily over the years; it is now deployed on many sites, such as those for <span class="docEmphasis1">The Onion</span>, <span class="docEmphasis1">Forbes</span><a name="In " class="calibre8" id="In "/> magazine, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2006, Drupal's developers numbered over 400, with Buytaert serving as the project lead.<a name="IDX-CHP-9-0159" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-9-0159"/></p>
