Yes, Linux does art, and as you will soon find out, a good number of programs on your system allow you to create and manipulate graphic files. These days, however, there is perhaps nothing so important to most users’ graphical repertoires as their digital cameras, so that is where we’ll begin.</p><div class="sect1" title="Where the Apps Are"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_the_apps_are-id1"/>Where the Apps Are</h1></div></div></div><p>The majority of apps in this chapter can be run from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking the Graphics filter button.

In fact, Ubuntu pretty much treats your camera as if it were an external hard drive or flash drive plugged into your computer’s USB port (which is pretty much what it is). And even if your camera doesn’t seem to communicate with your computer when connected directly, you can still transfer your images to your hard disk by removing the memory card from your camera, inserting it into a USB flash memory card reader, and plugging that reader into one of your computer’s USB ports.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0008"/></p><div class="sect2" title="13A-1: Importing Images from Camera to Computer Somewhat Automatically via Shotwell"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_importing_images_from_camera_t"/>13A-1: Importing Images from Camera to Computer Somewhat Automatically via Shotwell</h2></div></div></div><p>When you connect your camera to your computer via a USB cable, put your camera in play mode, and power it on, Ubuntu will usually automatically recognize it and open a window that asks how you want to import the photos on the camera.

Fortunately, Shotwell can make this a bit easier through the use of <span class="emphasis"><em>tags</em></span>. Tags are categories that you create yourself and then apply to whatever images you want in order to organize your collection thematically. You might, for example, create tags for each of your family members, or you might just create a broader tag for <span class="emphasis"><em>Family</em></span>. You could create tags for cities and countries you’ve visited, providing categories and subcategories for your travel pics. The choices and combinations are endless, and you can decide what they are all are. Once you’ve applied these tags to your photos, narrowing down your photo searches will be much easier.</p><p>The first step is to create a few tags. This is easily done by right-clicking an image and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tags</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. A small window will appear in which you can just type a single tag or, to kill two birds with one stone, whatever other tags you want to assign to the photo (<a class="xref" href="ch13.html#creating_tags_in_shotwell" title="Figure 13-9. Creating tags in Shotwell">Figure 13-9</a>). Just be sure to separate each tag with a comma. Once you’re done, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, after which the tags will appear both under the thumbnail and in the left pane of the window.</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_tags_in_shotwell"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e15182"/><img alt="Creating tags in Shotwell" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263818.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-9. Creating tags in Shotwell</p></div><p>Once you have tags in the left pane of the Shotwell window, adding those tags to other photos is a cinch. Just drag a thumbnail to one of the tags and release your mouse button, and the image will be tagged. If you want to add a second tag, just drag the thumbnail to that tag as well. Once you are done tagging your images, they will be far easier to sort, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#using_tags_in_shotwell_to_make_dealing_w" title="Figure 13-10. Using tags in Shotwell to make dealing with hefty photo collections much easier">Figure 13-10</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0021"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="using_tags_in_shotwell_to_make_dealing_w"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e15199"/><img alt="Using tags in Shotwell to make dealing with hefty photo collections much easier" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263820.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-10. Using tags in Shotwell to make dealing with hefty photo collections much easier</p></div><p>Searching for images by tag is perhaps even easier than adding the tags to the images in the first place.

If nothing else, these applications will give you an idea of the breadth of stuff out there waiting for you.</p><div class="sect2" title="RawTherapee"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="rawtherapee"/>RawTherapee</h2></div></div></div><p>RawTherapee is not some solution for what ails your troubled soul but rather a handy application that allows you to manipulate RAW image files. RAW image files are images that have not been processed by the on-board conversion software in your camera that converts the data it receives from the sensor into a format that your computer is able to deal with (usually JPEG files). For most people, JPEG images work just fine, but many photographers who want to have the best quality results after making adjustments to their images on their computers save their files in RAW image format, or RAW mode. While not all cameras have the option to save files in RAW mode, many advanced amateur and professional camera models do.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0025"/></p><p>Once you load RAW image files onto your computer, the thumbnails for those files will appear as black rectangles. That’s because they are essentially blobs of raw data that neither you nor your computer on its own can make heads or tails of. In a sense, they are a digital equivalent of photo negatives. This is where RawTherapee comes in (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#working_with_raw_images_in_rawtherapee" title="Figure 13-11. Working with RAW images in RawTherapee">Figure 13-11</a>). Once you open your RAW files with RawTherapee, you will be able to see what they actually look like and then go on to adjust them to your heart’s content, usually with much better results than you would get if working on JPEG files. Once you have made your adjustments to the RAW files, you can save them into other, more universally compatible file formats, such as JPEG, while retaining the original RAW file for future use.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0029"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="working_with_raw_images_in_rawtherapee"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e15261"/><img alt="Working with RAW images in RawTherapee" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263822.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-11. Working with RAW images in RawTherapee</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Arty with the GIMP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_arty_with_the_gimp"/>Getting Arty with the GIMP</h2></div></div></div><p>The Windows and Mac worlds may have Photoshop, but the Linux world has the GIMP (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#manipulating_a_digital_image_in_the_gimp" title="Figure 13-12. Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP">Figure 13-12</a>). Although arguably not as fully featured as Photoshop, the GIMP is a powerful contender, which may explain why it has been ported to both Mac and Windows. The GIMP allows you to create bitmap graphics and, importantly, retouch or completely doctor image files. With the GIMP you can get rid of red-eye in your digital photos, airbrush out unwanted shadows (or even facial blemishes), give your image a canvas texture, change a photo into an oil painting, and even add a bell pepper here and there—with drop shadows no less.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0032"/></p><p>Because not everyone needs or uses the features of the GIMP, the powers that be decided to no longer bundle it on the Ubuntu Desktop CD, thus freeing up space for more frequently run applications.

It is also a handy tool for resizing images. You can do this by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Image</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. This will open the Scale Image window, where you can set the new size of the image.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0034"/></p><p>The GIMP is also an excellent tool for converting images from one file format to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (<span class="emphasis"><em>.bmp</em></span>) file and save it as a PNG (<span class="emphasis"><em>.png</em></span>) file, save a JPEG (<span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span>) file as a GIF (<span class="emphasis"><em>.gif</em></span>) file, and so on. Although this can also be done with other graphics applications, including Shotwell, the GIMP supports an extremely wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save an image file as a compressed tarball, which makes it a true file conversion king.</p><p>To perform a file conversion, just right-click an image opened within the GIMP and then select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. You can make the same selection from the File menu if you prefer. Either way, the Save Image window will then appear. In that window, you can specify the new file format by replacing the original file extension in the Name box at the top of that window with the extension for the format you want to convert the image to. If you’re not sure what formats are available to you, click the small arrow to the left of the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Select File Type (By Extension)</em></span> at the bottom left of the window and then choose from the options in the pane that appears below.

Of course, you should make a backup copy of any file you are planning to experiment with before you alter it.</p><p>If you prefer learning via manuals and tutorials to just goofing around, you can download and install the GIMP User Manual via the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for <span class="emphasis"><em>gimp-help-en</em></span> and then installing <span class="strong"><strong>Documentation for the GIMP (English)</strong></span>. Once it is installed, you can access the manual from within the GIMP from the Help menu. You can also view the manual online at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/">http://docs.gimp.org/en/</a>, and you can find a series of tutorials at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/">http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0035"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0037"/></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Phatch Photo Batch Processor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="phatch_photo_batch_processor"/>Phatch Photo Batch Processor</h2></div></div></div><p>While the GIMP and Shotwell are quite capable of handling the vast majority of your photo-organizing and editing chores, they lack an easy-to-use batch file conversion method that allows you to apply various conversions to a group of files at the same time. For example, let’s say you want to convert 100 of your photos so they look like black-and-white snapshots with white borders, are 50 percent smaller than the originals, have a similar thematic filename, and are saved in <span class="emphasis"><em>.tiff</em></span> rather than <span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span> format. Apply-ing all these changes one by one would be excruciating. Fortunately, Phatch comes to the rescue! (See <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#batch_photo_file_conversions_with_phatch" title="Figure 13-13. Batch photo file conversions with Phatch">Figure 13-13</a>.)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0039"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="batch_photo_file_conversions_with_phatch"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e15393"/><img alt="Batch photo file conversions with Phatch" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263826.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-13. Batch photo file conversions with Phatch</p></div><p>Using Phatch is easy—and quite a bit of hocus-pocusy fun. However, its interface might not be obvious for a first-time user. With that in mind, here is a brief rundown on how to use Phatch:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> button in the main Phatch window, and the Phatch actions window will appear.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In that window, select the action (conversion) you want to apply to your photos and click <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>. Repeat this process for any other actions you want to apply.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once you have added all the actions you want, click each action in the main Action List and enter the appropriate parameters for each action (size, file format, size of border, output location, and so on).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the actions are not listed in the order you want them to occur, click the action you want to move and change its position using the up and down arrow buttons.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once everything is ready, save your Action List with a meaningful name by going to the Action List menu at the top of your screen and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. This way, you can use it again if need be.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Next, click the Execute button (the one that looks like three gears).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the window that appears, select your conversion parameters, making sure to select whether you are converting a whole folder full of files, selected files, or whatever it is you have in the clipboard. I would suggest unchecking the box next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Overwrite existing images</em></span> so that you keep your original images intact (<a class="xref" href="ch13.html#setting_your_final_conversion_parameters" title="Figure 13-14. Setting your final conversion parameters in Phatch">Figure 13-14</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="setting_your_final_conversion_parameters"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e15439"/><img alt="Setting your final conversion parameters in Phatch" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263828.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-14. Setting your final conversion parameters in Phatch</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once you have made your choices, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Browse Folder/Browse File(s)</strong></span> button and then select the folder of files or individual files you wish to convert. Once you have made your selection(s), click <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You will now be back at the window where you selected your parameters.

Click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> in that window.</p></li></ol></div><p>Phatch will then perform the conversions listed on your Action List in the order listed. It will show you the progress of its work, and a small window will appear to tell you when it’s done. You can see the converted product by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Show Images</strong></span>. If you failed to choose a destination folder, the newly created conversions should appear in a <span class="emphasis"><em>Phatch</em></span> folder on your desktop.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="MyPaint"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="mypaint"/>MyPaint</h2></div></div></div><p>If you prefer to do your electronic artwork with a graphics tablet rather than with a mouse, then MyPaint is for you.

In these images, the location and color of every single <span class="emphasis"><em>pixel</em></span> is recorded. Thus, the image is essentially a collection of dots. The file you create is a rather hefty map of these pixels, and this map tells your system where everything in your image is supposed to go when it is displayed or printed.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Vector drawing programs</em></span>, on the other hand, create vector images, which are actually collections of mathematical formulas representing the various shapes in your image. This may sound arcane, and you may be wondering why you should care. But such drawings have advantages in certain cases. One advantage is that vector image files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another, and perhaps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as a bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges (“the jaggies”) when enlarged to any extent, while the same circle in a vector image would remain smooth and round no matter how much you increased its size.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0045"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-13-0046"/></p><p>If you’re interested in giving a drawing program a go, then try Linux’s main offering, Inkscape (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#inkscape-id1" title="Figure 13-16. Inkscape">Figure 13-16</a>).

Some folks wish it still did. It has almost all the same features as Shotwell and a few of its own (such as creating original web album pages and some limited batch conversion capabilities).
