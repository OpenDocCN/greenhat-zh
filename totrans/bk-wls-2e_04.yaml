- en: A wireless local area network (LAN) obviously requires a somewhat different
    set of hardware components from a traditional wired network. This chapter describes
    the components that go into a wireless network and offers advice about deciding
    which components will best meet your needs. As you read the descriptions of features
    and functions in access points, network adapters, and antennas, remember that
    the marketplace for wireless networking equipment is both extremely competitive,
    and rapidly changing. If one manufacturer offers an access point or network adapter
    with a hot new feature, you can expect that same feature to show up in competing
    products within a few months or less. Therefore, this chapter does not discuss
    specific brands or models; by the time you read this, any such recommendation
    would be wildly out of date.

    the rules—and the realities—about using equipment made by more than one manufacturer

    the people at the Wi-Fi Alliance would have you believe.

    receive that certification, each device must undergo interoperability testing
    by the Alliance's independent testing lab. If an access point or network adapter
    carries a Wi-Fi logo, it has passed an extensive series of tests to confirm that
    it works with previously certified hardware from several other vendors.

    on the outside, and each maker provides its own configuration software, but the
    radio circuits inside are all pretty similar. Adapters that carry many brand names
    are actually made under contract by other companies, and just about everybody
    uses one of just a few standard chip sets.

    and access points together in the same network as long as they all follow the
    same specification (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11a, or 802.11g). The critical word in
    that last sentence is *possible*. In practice, certification really means that
    a group of technicians who are intimately familiar with the internal workings
    of Wi-Fi networks can get a mixed-vendor network to operate properly in a carefully
    run series of tests under tightly controlled laboratory conditions.

    never installed a wireless network can get that same combination of products to
    work? Oh, probably, but maybe not on the first attempt. It may take a lot of time
    and aggravation to set all the configuration options to the correct values. It's
    almost always a safe bet that devices from different makers will have different
    default settings. For example, some systems use short preambles as the default,
    and others use long preambles; some configurations request encryption keys as
    ASCII characters, but others might want them in hexadecimal. You can make all
    this stuff work together, but it might be a somewhat painful experience.

- en: As a general rule, it's almost always easier to equip your entire network with
    hardware from a single manufacturer because the configuration settings and options
    will all be the same, but that's not always possible or even the best choice.
    You can control the brands of access points in your own network, and you can buy
    the same brand of external network adapters for your desktop computers, but eventually
    one of the users in your office network (and you can probably predict who it will
    be, can't you?) will come to you with a Wi-Fi adapter made by somebody you've
    never heard of, and they'll expect it to connect to your network. Maybe the adapter
    showed up at a garage sale or a swap meet, or maybe it came with a shiny new laptop
    computer. Or maybe it's the one your daughter's school recommended for the on-campus
    network. And you have little or no control over the make and model of the internal
    adapters built into a laptop computer or the base station used by a public hot
    spot. For one reason or another, you'll eventually have to integrate hardware
    and software from more than one maker into the same network.

    laptop already has a wireless interface, there's generally no reason to replace
    it until a new Wi-Fi specification, such as the 802.11n standard, becomes available—and
    perhaps not even then if you're satisfied with your existing equipment. So choosing
    a new adapter is particularly important for owners of desktop computers and older
    laptops. If you have an older laptop without a built-in adapter, you can add Wi-Fi
    capability by installing a plug-in adapter on a PC Card or connecting a USB adapter.

    three Wi-Fi specifications (or all four, after 802.11n comes out). When the adapter

    the same specification to exchange data with that access point.

    to carry (and possibly forget or lose) yet another accessory item along with the
    computer. The disadvantage, if there is one, is that it's not practical to move
    the same adapter to a different computer when it's time to repair or replace the
    original machine. If the backup unit doesn't have an internal adapter (which is
    possible because it's probably older than the primary unit), the user or the network
    manager will either have to provide a separate adapter on a PC Card, connect through
    a USB cable, or go without wireless access to the local network and the Internet.

    to disable the adapter when you aren't using it. Most laptops use either a physical
    on/off switch or a pair of FN keys to turn the internal adapter on and off. If
    you don't turn it off when it's not in use, the radio unit will drain your computer's
    battery more quickly than necessary, and it will produce radio signals that can
    interfere with other users of the same unlicensed 2.4 GHz frequencies. Depending
    on the software your computer uses, leaving the wireless radio running can also
    expose you to security risks because your computer may connect to networks without

    to a PCMCIA connector but supports higher speed 32-bit cards such as 802.11a/g/n.
    Laptops purchased from the late 1990s onward should have CardBus support. Laptops
    made after 2006 might have a third type of adapter slot, called *ExpressCard*,

    antennas, but some manufacturers also offer versions with connectors for external
    antennas. The choice of an internal versus external antenna is always a trade-off.
    In most cases, the internal antenna is a lot easier to use with a portable computer
    because it doesn't force you to carry a separate antenna and cable. But it's much
    easier to adjust the exact location of an antenna at the end of a cable instead
    of the side or back of a computer that you must place in a position where you
    can comfortably see the screen and reach the keyboard. If you want to link to
    an access point from the extreme edges of a network's coverage area or if you're
    operating in a location with a lot of interference, a separate high-gain directional
    antenna can give you better and more reliable network performance than the antennas
    built into most PC Cards. If your usual PC Card adapter does not have an external
    antenna input connector, you might want to remove it and use a USB adapter with
    a high-gain antenna when you're trying to connect from a fringe location.

    tangled with the computer's other cables. The card sticks out from the back of
    the computer cabinet where you can't see the indicator lights. The backs of most
    desktop computers are often rats' nests of other cables and connectors that can
    all affect the radio's radiation pattern. And the computer's metal backplane may
    act as either an obstruction or a source of multipath interference between the
    adapter and the nearest access point. Of course, it's entirely possible that a
    PCI adapter will perform flawlessly, right out of the box, in spite of all those
    potential problems. Don't assume that it won't work until you have actually tried
    it in your own network, especially when the adapter was supplied with your computer.

    adapters with built-in antennas don't provide a good enough signal because of
    distance, obstructions, or interference from other radio signals, an external
    antenna may be the best way to solve the problem. As a rule of thumb, you can
    expect an external antenna to provide a signal at least 15 percent stronger than
    the antenna built into a PC Card adapter; special high-gain directional antennas
    can offer even better performance. This translates to either faster data exchange

    that allow the adapter to exchange data with the computer's central processor.
    You can safely assume that the software disk supplied with the adapter includes
    a driver for Microsoft Windows XP and probably for Windows Vista, but that won't
    do any good if the computer you're trying to link to your network uses Linux or
    some flavor of Unix. If you're a Macintosh user, Apple's AirPort family of adapters
    is usually the best choice.

    have to either find it someplace else or choose a different adapter that supports

    support website, which probably offers a variety of drivers for free download.
    It you can't find anything there, send a request for information to the manufacturer's
    technical support center; they might know of a third-party driver for your operating
    system or invite you to help test a new driver they haven't yet released. If that

    the television station that uses channel 4 in New York City transmits with 100,000
    watts of output power, but the nearest station that uses the same channel is in
