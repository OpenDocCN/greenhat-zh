  zh: 引言
- en: Imagine that sometime in the not-so-distant future an attacker decides to attack
    a multinational company’s digital assets, targeting hundreds of millions of dollars
    worth of intellectual property buried behind millions of dollars in infrastructure.
    Naturally, the attacker begins by firing up the latest version of Metasploit.

  zh: 想象一下，在不久的将来，一个攻击者决定攻击一家跨国公司的数字资产，目标是价值数十亿美元的知识产权，这些知识产权隐藏在数百万美元的基础设施背后。自然地，攻击者首先启动了Metasploit的最新版本。
- en: After exploring the target’s perimeter, he finds a soft spot and begins a methodical
    series of attacks, but even after he’s compromised nearly every aspect of the
    network, the fun has only just begun. He maneuvers through systems, identifying
    core, critical business components that keep the company running. With a single
    keystroke, he could help himself to millions of company dollars and compromise
    all their sensitive data.

- en: Congratulations on a job well done — you’ve shown true business impact, and
    now it’s time to write the report. Oddly enough, today’s penetration testers often
    find themselves in the role of a fictitious adversary like the one described above,
    performing legal attacks at the request of companies that *need* high levels of
    security. Welcome to the world of penetration testing and the future of security.

  zh: 为什么进行渗透测试？
- en: Companies invest millions of dollars in security programs to protect critical
    infrastructures, identify chinks in the armor, and prevent serious data breaches.
    A penetration test is one of the most effective ways to identify systemic weaknesses
    and deficiencies in these programs. By attempting to circumvent security controls
    and bypass security mechanisms, a penetration tester is able to identify ways
    in which a hacker might be able to compromise an organization’s security and damage
    the organization as a whole.

  zh: 公司投入数百万美元用于安全程序，以保护关键基础设施、识别防御漏洞并预防严重的数据泄露。渗透测试是识别这些程序中系统性弱点和不足的最有效方法之一。通过尝试绕过安全控制和绕过安全机制，渗透测试员能够识别黑客可能如何破坏组织的整体安全并损害组织。
- en: As you read through this book, remember that you’re not necessarily targeting
    one system or multiple systems. Your goal is to show, in a safe and controlled
    manner, how an attacker might be able to cause serious harm to an organization
    and impact its ability to, among other things, generate revenue, maintain its
    reputation, and protect its customers.

  zh: 为什么选择Metasploit？
- en: Metasploit isn’t just a tool; it’s an entire framework that provides the infrastructure
    needed to automate mundane, routine, and complex tasks. This allows you to concentrate
    on the unique or specialized aspects of penetration testing and on identifying
    flaws within your information security program.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Metasploit不仅仅是一个工具；它是一个完整的框架，提供了自动化日常、常规和复杂任务所需的基础设施。这让你可以专注于渗透测试的独特或专业方面，以及识别你信息安全程序中的缺陷。
- en: As you progress through the chapters in this book and establish a well-rounded
    methodology, you will begin to see the many ways in which Metasploit can be used
    in your penetration tests. Metasploit allows you to easily build attack vectors
    to augment its exploits, payloads, encoders, and more in order to create and execute
    more advanced attacks. At various points in this book we explain several third-party
    tools — including some written by the authors of this book — that build on the
    Metasploit Framework. Our goal is to get you comfortable with the Framework, show
    you some advanced attacks, and ensure that you can apply these techniques responsibly.
    We hope you enjoy reading this book as much as we enjoyed creating it. Let the
    fun and games begin.

- en: Metasploit was originally developed and conceived by HD Moore while he was employed
    by a security firm. When HD realized that he was spending most of his time validating
    and sanitizing public exploit code, he began to create a flexible and maintainable
    framework for the creation and development of exploits. He released his first
    edition of the Perl-based Metasploit in October 2003 with a total of 11 exploits.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the help of Spoonm, HD released a total rewrite of the project, Metasploit
    2.0, in April 2004\. This version included 19 exploits and over 27 payloads. Shortly
    after this release, Matt Miller (Skape) joined the Metasploit development team,
    and as the project gained popularity, the Metasploit Framework received heavy
    backing from the information security community and quickly became a necessary
    tool for penetration testing and exploitation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following a complete rewrite in the Ruby programming language, the Metasploit
    team released Metasploit 3.0 in 2007\. The migration of the Framework from Perl
    to Ruby took 18 months and resulted in over 150,000 lines of new code. With the
    3.0 release, Metasploit saw widespread adoption in the security community and
    a big increase in user contributions.

- en: 'In fall 2009, Metasploit was acquired by Rapid7, a leader in the vulnerability-scanning
    field, which allowed HD to build a team to focus solely on the development of
    the Metasploit Framework. Since the acquisition, updates have occurred more rapidly
    than anyone could have imagined. Rapid7 released two commercial products based
    on the Metasploit Framework: Metasploit Express and Metasploit Pro. Metasploit
    Express is a lighter version of the Metasploit Framework with a GUI and additional
    functionality, including reporting, among other useful features. Metasploit Pro
    is an expanded version of Metasploit Express that touts collaboration and group
    penetration testing and such features as a one-click virtual private network (VPN)
    tunnel and much more.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed to teach you everything from the fundamentals of the Framework
    to advanced techniques in exploitation. Our goal is to provide a useful tutorial
    for the beginner and a reference for practitioners. However, we won’t always hold
    your hand. Programming knowledge is a definite advantage in the penetration testing
    field, and many of the examples in this book will use either the Ruby or Python
    programming language. Still, while we suggest that you learn a language like Ruby
    or Python to aid in advanced exploitation and customization of attacks, programming
    knowledge is not required.

- en: As you grow more comfortable with Metasploit, you will notice that the Framework
    is frequently updated with new features, exploits, and attacks. This book was
    developed with the knowledge that Metasploit is continually changing and that
    no printed book is likely to be able to keep pace with this rapid development.
    Therefore, we focus on the fundamentals, because once you understand how Metasploit
    works you will be able to ramp up quickly with updates to the Framework.
