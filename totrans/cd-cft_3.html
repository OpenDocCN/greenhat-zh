The Eager Coder is fast and fleeting; he thinks in code. An impulsive, natural-born programmer, he writes code as soon as an idea forms in his head. He won't stand back and think first. So, although an Eager Coder does have very good technical skills, the code he writes never shows his true potential.</p><p>The Eager Coder often tries to use a new feature or idiom because it's fashionable. His desire to try out new tricks means that he applies technology even when it isn't appropriate.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Strengths</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Eager Coders are productive, in terms of code quantity. They write a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of code. They love learning new stuff and are really enthusiastic—even passionate—about programming. The Eager Coder loves his job, and genuinely <span class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> to write good code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Because of his unfettered enthusiasm, the Eager Coder is hasty and doesn't think before rushing into the code editor. He does write a lot of code, but because he writes so fast, it's flawed—the Eager Coder spends <span class="emphasis"><em>ages</em></span> debugging. A little forethought would prevent many silly errors and many hours ironing out careless faults.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Eager Coder is a really bad debugger. In the same way he rushes into coding, he dives straight into debugging. He's not methodical, so he spends ages chasing faults down blind alleys.</p><p>He's a poor estimator of time. He'll make a reasonable estimate for the case when it all goes well, but it never <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> go according to plan; he always takes longer than expected.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>What to do if you are one</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Don't lose that enthusiasm—it's one of the best characteristics of a programmer. Because your joy lies in seeing programs work and standing back and admiring the beauty of code, work out practical ways to do this. Writing units tests as an integral part of code development is a great idea. But it mostly boils down to this simple piece of advice: <span class="emphasis"><em>Stop and think</em></span>. Don't be hasty. Work out personal disciplines that will help you, even something basic like writing <span class="emphasis"><em>THINK</em></span> on a Post-It note and sticking it on your monitor!</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>How to work with them</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>When they work well, these are some of the best people to program alongside. The trick is to channel their energy into productive code rather than mindless flapping. They are great to work with in pair programming.</p><p>Ask an Eager Coder about what he's doing each day and what his plans are. Show an interest in his design—it will encourage him to really think about it! If you rely on an Eager Coder's work, ask for early pre-releases, and ask to see his unit tests too.</p><p>An Eager Coder benefits from appropriate management, to help with his discipline.

If you tried to create a movie on your own, the result would be poor. No one person can make a film on his or her own—or at least, not a film that's any good. To get a complete, edited movie to your television takes more effort: marketing, manufacture, distribution, retailing, and more. Perhaps you could create an entire "professional" software package yourself, but it would take a phenomenally long time. In the commercial world, who would give you such a risky contract?</p><p>In most professions, good products are the result of good teamwork. Software development is no exception. In fact, teamwork is <span class="emphasis"><em>vital</em></span> to the survival of a project. An ineffective team will quickly stifle any software development activity, leaving progress to the heroic efforts of a few dedicated individuals working against huge odds. Being a good software engineer means more than just being a good programmer. You might be able to compute PI to ridiculous accuracy in less than five lines of code. Well done.

The IBM OS/360 and the Linux kernel are notable successes for each camp, respectively. The Ariane 5 is a legendary flop—this European launcher exploded during its maiden take-off because two software teams misunderstood the formally defined interface. Mozilla is an interesting open source flop—when Netscape open sourced its code, they expected rapid development and improvement.

Inter-team dynamics, when separate teams interact, introduces the most complex teamwork considerations: Politics and managerial mistakes plague intra-organizational collaboration. Although a company is effectively one large team, it's not unusual for it to be layered with a "them and us" mentality between departments and groups.

We have the most control and influence over this world. It is the level we are responsible for, where we have authority to make design and implementation decisions and to report on team progress. Programmers are less responsible for the effects of higher level teams, but we are affected by teamwork "in the large" as much as we are by teamwork "in the small," even if it's not as immediately obvious.</p><p>Development team size dictates the dynamic and nature of shared software construction work as much as the team's place in the organizational food chain.

In really small outfits, they may also have to work on gathering requirements and create and run a thorough test plan.</p><p>As soon as more developers are added to this mix, the nature of the programming task changes.

They are each given a piece of work and implement it end-to-end—from the architecting and designing, right through implementation and integration, to development testing and documentation.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1297"/></p><p>The main advantage of this approach is that developers gain a wider range of skills and become more experienced in the whole software system. With one key developer per feature, there is cohesion in its design and implementation. However, generalists are expensive and hard to find. They don't have expertise in all areas and therefore take longer to solve some problems. There is likely to be less cohesion between separate features, since they are implemented by different developers. The customer has to work with more people, since there's no specific liaison point—each developer needs to give input to scope the requirements and validate the design.</p><p>To make this kind of team work, you must define common standards and guidelines. You must have good communication to prevent people from reinventing the wheel. A common architecture must be agreed upon early on, or a chaotic and haphazard system will ensue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In contrast, a <span class="emphasis"><em>horizontally organized team</em></span> is built from a team of specialists, and every development task is split between them, using their respective talents at the appropriate times. Because each aspect of work (requirements gathering, design, coding, etc.) is done by a specialist, it should be of a higher quality.</p></li></ul></div><p>This has many opposite characteristics to the vertical arrangement: We build cohesion between separate work packages, but there's a danger that each set of work holds together less well because more people have worked on it. Interaction outside the team (with customers or other company factions) is made by a small number of specialists. This is easier to manage for the team itself and the external contacts.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="it_apostrophy_s_all_going_pair_shaped"/><p class="title"><b>IT'S ALL GOING PAIR SHAPED</b></p><p>Pair programming is a collaborative software development approach, especially fashionable in agile development circles. It has claimed to make programmers more efficient: producing code faster, with fewer faults.</p><p>Two developers code together—at the same time, at the same terminal. While one (the driver) types, the other (the navigator) thinks about what's being done and acts as second pair of eyes, removing many mistakes before they have a chance to bite. The pair periodically swaps roles. The navigator sees consequences that the driver would miss, removing the common danger of being focused narrowly on the code as it's typed. Two people think of more than two ways to solve any problem, so you're far more likely to hit upon the best code design. Because of this unusually close collaboration, pair programming best suits talented programmers who have positive attitudes.</p><p>Studies claim that, once trained, two programmers are more than twice as productive on any given task. According to data published in The Economist, "Laurie Williams of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City has shown that paired programmers are only 15 percent slower than two independent individual programmers, but produce 15 percent fewer bugs. Since testing and debugging are often many times more costly than initial programming, this is an impressive result." (Economist 01)</p><p>Pair programming has many advantages. It promotes knowledge transfer and aids mentoring, increases your focus (you are less likely to daydream, take long phone calls, or tune out), increases discipline, and reduces interruptions (you're less likely to interrupt two people working closely together than a single programmer staring vacantly into space). It works as an early real-time inspection mechanism— an instant code review—and brings the benefits of better code. It's a social process; with the right people, it improves morale (although it can be disastrous when two people grate against each other). The programmers get to know each other more closely and better understand how to work together. Pair programming promotes collective code ownership, spreads good coding culture and values, and emphasizes the development process.</p></div><p>You must take care to ensure that the specialists are well coordinated and that they see right through to the end of each work package, or their work will be narrow-sighted. With many people involved in each development procedure, the team is harder to manage; there is more workflow. This arrangement requires good communication, defined processes, and smooth handoffs between developers.</p><p>There is no "right" kind of organization. Which one is most appropriate depends on the team members, the size of the team, and the nature of the work produced. The pragmatic arrangement is probably somewhere in the middle.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="organization_and_code_structure"/>Organization and Code Structure</h2></div></div></div><p>A team's organization has an inevitable affect on the code it produces. This is enshrined in software folklore as <span class="emphasis"><em>Conway's Law</em></span>. Simply stated, it says, "If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a four-pass compiler." Your code inevitably takes on the structure and dynamics of your interacting teams. The major software components lie where teams gather, and their communications follow the team interactions. Where groups work closely, component communication is simple and well defined. When teams separate, the code interacts clumsily.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1303"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1298"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1299"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1300"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1301"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1302"/></p><p>We naturally aim to create well-defined interfaces between each team's work to facilitate our interaction with that team. We do so even in cases where reaching into some internal part of another component might be a valid and better approach. In this way, teams can foster arbitrary divisions; despite our good intentions, design decisions are forced by team composition.</p><p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with encapsulation and abstraction; but they must be designed in for the right reasons.

Problems loom when a Dictator's personality doesn't support his position, or when he is technically substandard (see "<a class="xref" href="ch16.html#the_demiguru" title="The Demiguru">The Demiguru</a>" on page 300). If his ego gets in the way, the team is in trouble: They will resent him and grind to a frustrated halt.</p><p>When fashioned on purpose, this kind of team is a hierarchy, with lines of defined authority. This structure was likened to a <span class="emphasis"><em>surgical team</em></span> by Frederick Brooks. (Brooks 95) The surgical team places the most highly qualified technical individual, the lead surgeon,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-17-FN-4" id="CHP-17-FN-4">4</a>]</sup> at the top of the pile: acting as a code writer, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a manager. He performs the bulk of the development and has ultimate responsibility if bad things happen (if the patient dies). He is backed up by a deliberately chosen team. This includes a junior surgeon who performs smaller, lower-risk tasks, supports the lead surgeon, and learns the trade. The team also involves the software equivalent of anaesthetists, nurses, and perhaps more junior surgeons learning skills (e.g., sewing up the patient).</p><p>There are two dangers with this kind of team. The first comes when external pressures force the Dictator to become more of a manager; his technical specialism almost guarantees a lack of management skills. His focus will shift away from the software and the project will collapse. The second danger is a self-appointed Dictator, who isn't recognized by the team. Workflow will stall as the team is neither structured nor prepared to support his leadership.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Warning Signs</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This team structure tends to develop slowly and subtly, as a would-be Dictator slowly modifies the focus of his work role and presumes his level of authority.

This is a team of peers—programmers with similar levels of skill and complementary personalities—who organize themselves in a nonhierarchical fashion. It's an unusual beast in the corporate world, which expects that someone must be boss. The idea of a self-organizing team seems heretical. However, it has been shown to be a team model that can work well. Some democratic teams run by periodically electing a leader from their ranks, based on whose skills are most in demand at this stage of the project. Often there is not a clear leader, and all decisions are taken by consensus. Open source development often follows this pattern.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1320"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1321"/></p><p>We tend to forget the other half of that proverb: All men are created equal, but by practice grow apart. It takes a special set of individuals to make this team culture work. The danger with a team founded on this laudable principle is that as it grows, or when a certain member leaves (the one who crystallizes the group into making decisions), things begin to drift. The team can lose its focus, failing to agree on anything, and failing to produce results in a timely fashion. In the worst case, the team ends up arguing forever about a single issue, contemplating its navel, and never actually achieving anything.</p><p>With endless meetings and circular discussions, the team is in danger of <span class="emphasis"><em>analysis paralysis</em></span>: of becoming focused on process, not on delivery of the project. Like a real democracy, the genuine team business can get lost in a sea of politicking.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1322"/></p><p>You can accidentally end up with a Development Democracy if you have a ineffective team leader who is incapable of making decisions. This kind of bumbling leader will slowly phase himself out without realizing it. The frustrated team ends up jointly taking over his role—forcing decisions to be made and choosing the direction of development.</p><p>Democracy is a particularly difficult team structure in a crisis, even when established on purpose.

Weeks can go by without a specification being completed and with no visible progress.</p><p>In a rampant Development Democracy, the smallest decision forces the team into committee mode, and it takes days to conclude. Or a decision is made: Let's say <span class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span> until we decide to do something else. "Let your 'yes' be yes, and your 'no' be no,"<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-17-FN-5" id="CHP-17-FN-5">5</a>]</sup> otherwise you'll spend ages ripping up old code and redoing it whenever someone changes his mind.</p><p>You might also notice that junior programmers feel alienated because they'll never be elected leader.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Turnarounds</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Democracies aim to remove a specific bottleneck: where all decisions must be made by the boss, who is not always the most appropriate person to make them (especially when the boss isn't technical).

To return to a healthy Democracy, ensure that leadership can move around the team freely and that replacing the leader is easy.

They are naturally seated together and learn to work as a swift, cohesive unit. As the project progresses, more programmers are required, and junior members are brought in. Because of the existing office layout, they are seated on the periphery and then given smaller programming tasks in order to learn the structure of the system.</p><p>Without careful checking, the senior developers adopt a superior attitude and look down on the junior developers.

The senior developers reason that it would take a prohibitively long time to teach a junior about the bigger picture, and there <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an element of truth there.

Now, let's see how to make some sense of this mess and how to do things right. In the rest of this chapter, we'll look at techniques that will improve your software development team and hopefully avoid these pitfalls. Although tools and technology do help to improve productivity, the largest gains are related to the human aspects of relationships between people and their work.</p><p>Every software team is comprised of individuals. To start improving your team's performance, you can begin close to home—by addressing <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> attitudes toward the team and the joint development effort. We're not all managers, so this is really the main area that we have any influence over.</p><p>To be a high-quality programmer, you must be a high-quality team player. There are number of nontechnical skills, characteristics, and attitudes that an effective team member must develop before we can even consider his or her programming language dexterity or design capability.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="communication"/>Communication</h2></div></div></div><p>Teamwork is dead without communication. Individual parts cannot move as a whole without communication. The goal and vision cannot be shared without communication. Projects really do fail because of a lack of good communication.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1339"/></p><p>Intra-team communication occurs in several ways: conversations between individual engineers, phone calls, meetings, written specifications, email correspondence, reports, and instant messaging. Sometimes we even communicate in pictures! Each medium has a particular usage dynamic and is most appropriate for a specific kind of discussion.</p><p>The most effective communication should involve (or at the very least be visible to) all relevant parties. It should be sufficiently detailed but shouldn't consume too much time or effort. It should be performed in a suitable medium—for example, design decisions should be captured in a written specification, not verbally agreed upon and shared by word of mouth.</p><p>We've already seen how code itself is a form of communication. A programmer <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be able to communicate well. This requires both good input and good output—the ability to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Write unambiguous specifications, to describe ideas clearly, and keep things succinct.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Read and comprehend specifications correctly, to listen carefully, and to understand what you are told.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to intra-team communication, we must also consider communication <span class="emphasis"><em>between</em></span> teams. The classic example of bad communication seen in most companies exists between the marketing department and the engineers. If marketing doesn't ask the engineers what is possible, then it will sell products that the company can't make. This problem is cyclical: once it has occurred and people have been burned, the two teams are less likely to talk to each other (due to resentment). It will then happen again and again.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1340"/></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Clear lines of effective communication are vital to a well-functioning team.

They don't slack off to let others do all the work. They don't believe that they are the only talented people capable of making a worthwhile contribution.</p><p>You can't hoard all the good work for yourself; it's just not possible for one person to do everything. You have to be willing to let another team member contribute—even if it's something you <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to do.</p><p>You should listen to and value the opinions of other people. Yours is not the only point of view, not the only solution. You don't necessarily know the only or the best way to solve every problem. Listen to others, <span class="emphasis"><em>respect them</em></span>, value their work, and learn from them.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1343"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dealing_with_conflict"/>Dealing with Conflict</h2></div></div></div><p>We have to be realistic: Some people can't help winding each other up. In this situation, we must be mature and responsible in our attitudes and learn to avoid (or learn to resolve) conflict situations. Conflict and animosity will severely degrade the performance of a team.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1344"/></p><p>However, harnessed and channeled conflict can be a major success factor in your teamwork. Teammates who stimulate and provoke each other produce the best designs. Disagreement can act as a refining process, ensuring that ideas are valid. Knowing that your work will be cast under a critical eye keeps you focused.</p><p>It's important to keep this kind of conflict constructive—on a strictly professional, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> personal, level.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="communication_breakdown"/><p class="title"><b>COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN</b></p><p>There are many communication methods in our highly connected world, and we must learn to use them effectively to support and facilitate our team interaction.

All too often, programmers try to avoid human interaction (we're not a social species by nature!), but meetings have a valuable place in our teamwork. We'll look at this in more detail in "<a class="xref" href="ch17s07.html#meeting_your_fate" title="MEETING YOUR FATE">MEETING YOUR FATE</a>" on page 340.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1348"/></p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="learning_and_adaptability"/>Learning and Adaptability</h2></div></div></div><p>You must continually learn new technical skills, but you must also learn to work as a team. It's not a God-given gift. A new team has to learn how to work together, how each member reacts, each member's strengths and weaknesses, and how to capitalize on individual skills to the group's benefit (see "<a class="xref" href="ch17s07.html#team_growth" title="Team Growth">Team Growth</a>" on page 341 for more on this).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1349"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1350"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1351"/></p><p>Emerson wrote, "Every man I meet is in some way my superior." Look at what you can gain from your peers. Learn from what they know, learn what they're like, and learn how they react. Learn to communicate with them. Seek criticism from them at all levels, from the formal code review to their passing opinions offered in conversation.</p><p>Adaptability is tied closely with learning. If the team has a need that no developer can currently fulfill and it's not possible to bring in an outside resource, then a solution needs to be found.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="teamwork_principles"/>Teamwork Principles</h1></div></div></div><p>Here are the key team precepts that, once absorbed into your group's DNA, will change the way you write software. They shift focus away from individuals to the software and its collaborative development. Remember: For these principles to be effective in your team, you must make a purposeful change toward them; don't just agree they're good ideas and carry on coding as you always have.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="collective_code_ownership"/>Collective Code Ownership</h2></div></div></div><p>Many programmers are territorial about their work. This is natural: Programming is a very personal, creative act. We're proud when we craft an elegant module, and we don't want anyone to trample all over it, destroying the masterpiece. That would be sacrilege.</p><p>But effective teamwork demands that we shed egos before entering the software factory. Don't complain that "Fred fiddled with my code." It's a team effort: The code is not owned by you; it's owned by the team. Without this attitude, each programmer builds his or her own empire, not a successful software system.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>No programmer owns any part of the codebase. Everyone in the team has access to the whole code and can modify it as is appropriate</em></span>.</p></dd></dl></div><p>With this culture in place, the team immunizes itself from the danger of little Programmer Kings, each ruling their own islands of code. If no one has ever been allowed to see a certain person's code, what happens when that person leaves the project? Losing a local expert will severely disadvantage the team.</p><p>It's not wrong to feel a sense of parental responsibility for the code you produce, to be protective of it, and to want to nurture it. But this must be connected to a healthy team focus. Instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>ownership</em></span>, consider code <span class="emphasis"><em>stewardship</em></span>. Stewards don't own their charges, they are appointed to maintain them <span class="emphasis"><em>on behalf of</em></span> the owner. A steward has primary responsibility for a piece of code's upkeep, weeding it, and tending the borders. Usually the steward makes all changes, although trusted team members can also make changes that would ultimately be verified by the steward. This is a constructive approach to your code and one that will serve the team well.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="respect_other_peoples_code"/>Respect Other People's Code</h2></div></div></div><p>Even in an enlightened development culture without code ownership, you must still respect other people's code. Don't tinker with it at random. This holds especially true if they're working on it right now. You can't change something under another programmer's feet; it will cause untold confusion.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1359"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1360"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1361"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1362"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1363"/></p><p>Respect for others' code means that you should honor the presentation style and design choices currently in place. Don't make gratuitously inappropriate modifications. Honor the method of error handling. Comment your changes appropriately.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1364"/></p><p>Avoid making quick hacks that you'd be embarrassed to see in a code review. They slip in when you need to get your code working quickly and one small tweak elsewhere makes your stuff compile. If you forget to tidy the tweak, then you've just degraded someone else's code. Even temporary modifications must show respect.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="code_guidelines"/>Code Guidelines</h2></div></div></div><p>For collaborative development to produce reasonable code, your team <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> have a set of code guidelines. These are dictates on the standard of code a programmer must write, ensuring that everything in the system reaches a certain minimum quality.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1365"/></p><p>It's important not to stir arguments over code layout (although it is better if all code follows one style). However, there must be consensus on the standard and mechanism for code documentation, for language use and common idioms, for the act of interface creation, and for architectural design.</p><p>Teams that get by without such guidelines still do have them: just as unwritten conventions. The problem with such implicit knowledge is that a new team member's code won't match the existing codebase until he or she has been integrated into the code culture.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="define_success"/>Define Success</h2></div></div></div><p>To feel like they're achieving something and that they're working well together, the team members need a clear set of targets and goals.

Do it publicly. Keep feeding the team members praise and encouragement. It's surprising how refreshing some support and enthusiasm is.</p><p>Mix up people's jobs; don't force someone to repeatedly do the same kind of task until they get bored and give up. Give everyone a chance to learn and to develop new skills. "A change is as good as a rest."

Responsibility for this is placed on the person calling the meeting:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Meetings are important and inevitable. Don't shy away from calling a meeting when it's needed. However, don't call one when an informal chat in the hallway would resolve the problem more quickly and with less overhead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Give plenty of notice of a meeting—days, not hours. Invite the right people: not too few people (no work can get done because the decision makers are absent), and not too many (no work can get done because everyone's struggling to make themselves heard).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Convene the meeting at a reasonable time. Not ridiculously early in the morning when only half of the attendees are normally awake, and not so late in the day that everyone's tired, fed up, and itching to get home.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Set a strict time limit, and declare it up front. Stick to it. This way, attendees know how much of their day remains to do other work. If you overrun, defer business to another meeting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure that everyone knows what the meeting is about and why they have been asked to attend. Distribute an agenda with the meeting announcement. Ensure that everyone who needs to make prior preparation is aware of their expected input.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure that everyone knows where the meeting is being held. Ensure that the location has appropriate facilities: a whiteboard, a computer, and even enough chairs (this sounds silly, but is often overlooked).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Define roles before the meeting begins. You must have at least:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>A chairman</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This person leads the meeting, keeps discussion on topic, and to the agenda.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1374"/></p><p>He or she makes sure the meeting concludes on time, with a suitable resolution (perhaps this is the scheduling of another meeting).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>A secretary</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This person takes minutes of the proceedings, writes them up afterward, and circulates them to the appropriate audience (this is probably a larger group than the meeting attendees).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-1375"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Decision maker(s)</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>These people have the final say on each issue.

Most meetings are either <span class="emphasis"><em>informational</em></span> (to disseminate information; attendees are largely a captive audience), or for <span class="emphasis"><em>conflict resolution</em></span> (to work out a solution to a pressing problem). To run an effective meeting, everyone must understand this and act appropriately. Personal agendas can quickly steer an informational meeting in a random direction; the chairman must spot this and prevent people from hijacking a meeting for their own purposes.</p></div><p>The initial aim when forming a team is to create more than a mere <span class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span>.

As the need for each role is felt, but before the need is acute, people must be brought in. Appointing members needs management insight, both of a candidate's personality type, his or her technical skills, and the job requirements.

Team members are assigned their own work packages and kept synchronized (perhaps by a project meeting or by close communication). Their work is integrated as it's completed. Slowly, the software takes shape.</p><p>Although working to a predetermined development process, the team must adapt to changes as they arise: handling unforeseen problems, changes in the team, or the dreaded Shifting Requirements Syndrome. As work progresses, each member must identify and manage outstanding issues and risks.</p><p>The team must get into a development groove—finding the appropriate pace of work, and meeting targets at each step of the way.

No team can continue forever or plan to work indefinitely. The lure of completion actually motivates people, and many programmers won't invest much effort until confronted with a hard deadline.</p><p>For this reason, every team must plan to disband, dissolve, or transition to a different kind of team (perhaps a maintenance or support team) upon project completion. This plan must cover both normal and abnormal completion conditions.</p><p>Team disbanding doesn't happen suddenly. Projects don't halt without warning; they slowly ramp down. We usually transition people off a project gradually as they become surplus to requirements. No team needs people kicking around doing nothing, absorbing resources.

To manage and version your software effectively, you must collect your <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> source tree in one repository. This includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>All source code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The build scaffolding</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unit test code and any test harnesses</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Any other assets required to create a packaged distribution (graphics, data files, configuration files, and so on)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1418"/></p></li></ul></div><p>The ultimate goal is to perform an entire build out of the repository. Starting with just the build toolchain and the source control tool, you should be able to generate a complete product in a few simple steps (i.e., check out the repository and type <code class="literal">make</code>)—without needing to supply any more files or modify anything by hand. If you have to add anything else to the source tree, then your software is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> under change control.</p><p>But why stop there? We can extend this list to be really thorough:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Consider placing the whole development environment under change control. Check in every build tool update, and keep these files synchronized with each release version of your software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Revision control all documentation: specifications, release notes, manuals, and so on.</p></li></ul></div></div><p>All good source control systems allow you to create named <span class="emphasis"><em>labels</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>tags</em></span>) and apply them to specific versions of a set of files. This allows you to mark important repository states: You can identify all the files that comprised a specific code release and retrieve them easily with this label at a later date. This is helpful when you're working on product version 3, but an important customer finds a critical bug in the first release, and you need the code ASAP.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1419"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1420"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1421"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1422"/></p><p>With each check-in, you can attach metadata: at the very least, a textual description of the change you have made. Using these messages, you can get an overview of development by viewing a file's revision log. More sophisticated tools allow you to add arbitrary metadata to file revisions, including references to fault reports, supporting documentation, test data, and so on.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1423"/></p><p>Good source control tools version directories as well as files. This enables you to track modifications made to the file structure, including the creation, deletion, moving, and renaming of files. Some source control tools record changes on a file-by-file basis; when you check in many files at once, each one is versioned individually. Other tools implement <span class="emphasis"><em>changesets</em></span>: They record each batch of file changes as an atomic modification.

A project's buildmaster is usually responsible for administering the source control tool, assigning these access rights, and ensuring that the repository is kept tidy. It's important to have a designated source control administrator.

You also want to start a second development effort on the same source files to port the code to a new operating system. The two tasks must begin separately, but eventually they will merge back together. This is a common development scenario. For each task, you create a <span class="emphasis"><em>branch</em></span> in the repository, and commit code revisions onto the branch rather than onto the main line of code development. This keeps the two tasks in separate worlds. One developer works on the drawing tools, another concentrates on the porting effort. Their work does not interfere.</p><p>As the name implies, branches create a tree structure of parallel file revisions in the repository. There is always at least one line of code development called the <span class="emphasis"><em>trunk</em></span> (for obvious reasons). <a class="xref" href="ch18s02.html#branching_a_project_under_version_control" title="Figure 18-1. Branching a project under version control">Figure 18-1</a> shows this in practice for a particular file being branched. It was created (at <span class="emphasis"><em>version 1</em></span>) and intially developed on the trunk—the center column. At <span class="emphasis"><em>version 2</em></span>, we create the first feature's branch (for new drawing tools) and perform a number of check-ins down it. None of these affect code in the trunk at all. Work on the trunk continues concurrently, and at <span class="emphasis"><em>version 3</em></span>, a second branch is created to accommodate the porting task.</p><div class="figure"><a id="branching_a_project_under_version_control"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e25796"/><img alt="Branching a project under version control" src="tagoreillycom20080909nostarchimages207562.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 18-1. Branching a project under version control</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Work progressing down a branch can be <span class="emphasis"><em>merged</em></span> with any other branch or back down onto the trunk. This means, for example, that you can try some exploratory bugfix work in a branch and, when proven stable, you can merge it back into the main code. If it was a development dead end, then you can abandon the branch—with no effect on the trunk. Very useful. In our example, the first branch is merged at <span class="emphasis"><em>version 2.9</em></span> into main's <span class="emphasis"><em>version 4</em></span>. This results in main's <span class="emphasis"><em>version 5</em></span>. Later, the second branch is also merged down to main.</p><p>Even if you're not simultaneously developing features in your codebase, branching can be usefully applied to single-track development. This scheme leaves the trunk version stable: always a complete, tested product—probably the latest release version of the code. Each feature is developed on its own feature (or release) branch, and the product itself is released from this branch. When complete, we merge it back down to the trunk and create a new branch from there for the next feature. This keeps the mainline code free from potentially broken work in progress and keeps all related work collated together on a development branch rather than scattered down the mainline alongside a host of other feature development work.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a_brief_history_of_source_control"/>A Brief History of Source Control</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many different source control systems available with both open and proprietary licenses.

This holds for both binary distributed programs and the source code that creates it. Most proprietary licenses withdraw the rights of copying, modification, lending, renting, and use on more than one machine. On the other hand, open source licenses strive to protect your right to copy and distribute the software at will.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1474"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1475"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1476"/></p><p>Software authors choose their licenses based on specific goals and ideologies. Indeed, an author can chose to release software under multiple licenses, covering different usage patterns and permitting different price and support models. There are many types of source code licenses, although only a few are commonly used. They differ in:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Permitted use</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Can the licensed code be exploited commercially, or may it only be used in free software? It's not really making money that's the issue, but whether proprietary closed products can incorporate your work without permission. Some open source licenses require the user to release any code built with their software. A typical commercial license lets you do what you want, as long as you pay.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1477"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Terms of modification</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>If you change the code, must you publish those changes? Or can you ship derived works without any further obligation? Some open source licenses are described as "viral" because any change you make must also be released under the same open source license, and likewise any code you ship using it.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Commercial licenses are drawn up by company lawyers to suit their nefarious purposes (that is, protecting the company's commercial investment). However, there are many common free or open source licenses. <span class="emphasis"><em>Open source</em></span> is a term coined by the <span class="emphasis"><em>Open Source Initiative (OSI)</em></span>, an organization that certifies software licenses. The availability of source is not enough to characterize a product as open source. It must provide certain rights: to allow free modification and redistribution of the code or any modifications, but with the restriction that these rights must be given to all and be non-revocable.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1478"/></p><p>Open source conflicts with the Free Software Foundation's concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>free software</em></span>. The FSF (steward of the GNU Project) is rather more ideological and promotes software licenses that are <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>, as in <span class="emphasis"><em>speech</em></span>, not just free, as in <span class="emphasis"><em>beer</em></span>—the word <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> is used in the sense of the French <span class="emphasis"><em>libre</em></span>. OSI accept some free-as-in-beer licenses, which does not endear them to the GNU faithful. GNU's famous licenses are the GNU General Public License <span class="emphasis"><em>(GPL)</em></span> and the GNU Lesser General Public License <span class="emphasis"><em>(LGPL)</em></span>. The latter is a more lax "library" version that allows linking with proprietary code.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-1479"/></p></div></div>
