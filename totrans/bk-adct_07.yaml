    with a little bit of recording gear and an Internet connection can create an audio
    broadcast to share with the world. You can tell stories, report news, and share
    how-tos. Your podcast can be just you talking, you interviewing another person,
    you and a cohost, or you and a gaggle of cohosts and guests. You can add a music
    track or special effects. Making podcasts with Audacity is easy and fun.

    be a single mono track, a stereo track, and even a sound track. In Audacity, it
    is helpful to think of a track as any single editable unit, which is any mono
    track or stereo track. Any edits that you make, such as deletions, additions,
    special effects, and so on, will be applied equally to the left and right channels
    in an Audacity stereo track.

    into a microphone takes a bit of practice. You might practice speaking into a
    microphone without creating unwanted noises such as smacks, pops, loud breathing,
    clicking dentures, or any other unpleasant sounds. Beware verbal ticks like “uh,
    um, you know.” Practice gauging the optimal distance between your mouth and the
    microphone, and set it up so that you can stand or sit comfortably. Using a mic
    stand is better than hand-holding, and if you’re using a lavalier mic, clip it
    where your clothing won’t rub on it. I prefer a good-quality USB headset. Speak
    past the mic as though you have an audience in the room, rather than into the
    mic; this will help you energize your voice and project it in a way that will
    reduce unwanted side effects. A windscreen or a foam windsock is essential.

    of two words per second, but it means relaxing and using carefully timed pauses

    It’s comfortable and easy to use, and the sound quality is good. USB recording
    interfaces have their own analog-to-digital converters, so you don’t need a sound
    card. They also eliminate the risk of picking up internal computer noise, which
    is sometimes a problem with internal sound cards.

    I am editing. If you have used Audacity very much, you know that a slip of the
    mouse or accidentally hitting a hotkey will lose your place, and if it’s a long
    track, it’s a pain to get back to where you where. So, don’t delete your selection
    but instead use **Edit** > **Split Delete**. This replaces the selection with
    an empty gap, as in [Figure 7-6](ch07s02.html#using_edit_g_split_delete_to_leave_a_gap
    "Figure 7-6. Using Edit > Split Delete to leave a gap marking your deletion").
    This also keeps your track at the same length, which you might want if you have
    two or more tracks to keep synchronized.

    will match exactly when you see the Snap Guide appear, which is a yellow vertical
    line that appears when borders are perfectly lined up. Click to mark the place
    where the borders join, and then zoom way in until you can use the Repair effect
    to smooth over the edge of your patch. This operates on a maximum sample size
    of 128 samples, so zoom way in until you can make a selection that small. The
    Zoom tool centers on wherever you click. Then click **Effect** > **Repair**, which
    uses interpolation to make a seamless join.

    > **Change Tempo** to slow down your patch without changing the pitch. You can
    measure the exact length required by selecting the “Length” radio button in the
    Selection toolbar and then make a selection from the beginning of your patch to
    the end of the gap. The yellow Snap Guides will appear when you are exactly on
    your borders. The example in [Figure 7-8](ch07s02.html#figuring_out_how_long_your_patch_needs_t

    aren’t clipped, and review them to decide whether they need to be reduced. In
    this example, I was speaking too loudly from the excitement of making a podcast,
    so I used **Effect** > **Amplify** to reduce the amplitude. Yes, it says “amplify,”
    but if you give it a negative value (such as -3 or -6 dB), it will attenuate.

    "Figure 7-12. This selection could be as many as 12 decibels too loud.")). In
    this example, it looks like the loud part could be as many as 12 decibels too
    loud, so that gives me a starting point of -12 to try. Remember, Audacity gives
    you nearly unlimited undos (**Edit** > **Undo** or ctrl-Z), so it’s safe to use
    trial and error.

    more complex passages will have a higher bitrate. This delivers better quality
    than a fixed bitrate. You won’t be able to calculate file sizes precisely, but
    the fine folks who invented Ogg Vorbis don’t think much of measuring quality by
    bitrates anyway. To give a basis for comparison, a quality setting of 3 results
    in an average bitrate of around 112Kbps, and Ogg fans claim it sounds better than
    a 128Kbps MP3.

    the left and right channels are combined to save space. This might affect the

    channel coupling is turned off at this level. I use 6\. My ears can’t tell the

    to the complexity of the sounds, which results in better audio quality. In the
    olden days, variable bitrates gave MP3 players fits because they were designed
    for *constant bitrates (cbr)*. But that was a long time ago, and these days variable
