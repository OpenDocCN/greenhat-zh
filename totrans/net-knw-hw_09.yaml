    that all the other computers on the same network can use. A file server can also
    be used as a workstation, a computer dedicated to file storage, or a single-purpose
    *network-attached storage (NAS)* device. This chapter describes the advantages
    of connecting one or more file servers to your network and explains how to set
    them up and use them.

    or an older unit that no longer has enough computing power for day-to-day use,
    that might be a good candidate, especially if you just want to share files and
    add network storage capacity. You will probably get better performance from an
    older computer if you add some extra memory and one or more new hard drives—Linux
    server software only needs about 10GB of hard drive space, but an older hard drive
    could be more likely to fail due to age and wear. And, of course, you will also
    need disk space for all the files that you store on the server.

    include all the features of a simple file server along with many additional business
    functions such as web and email hosting, calendar coordination, remote access,
    automated backup, and data management, all with a more-or-less consistent appearance.
    These server packages are relatively expensive, but their easy installation and
    available support might be worth the added cost, especially in a large enterprise
    where additional support staff is an issue. The developers of these commercial
    server products argue that the *total cost of ownership (TCO)* for their products,
    including original purchase price and the cost of ongoing maintenance and support,
    is about the same as the TCO of "free" Linux and Unix servers. Microsoft claims
    that management and maintenance staffing plus downtime account for roughly 75
    percent of a server's TCO, but the experience of many open source software users
    is quite different. In a very small business, the numbers will probably work out
    in favor of free or inexpensive server software unless you have to pay for outside
    support.

    confirm that the program can accurately restore those files, including the metadata
    embedded inside them. Some Mac backup programs designed for earlier versions have
    trouble dealing with OS X files.

- en: Linux and Unix users have a wide choice of backup programs, including several
    that can originate the backup process from either the server (pulling backup data
    from client computers) or from individual client computers (pushing the backup
    files to a server). The Linux Online! website includes an up-to-date list of backup
    programs at *http://www.linux.org/apps/all/Administration/Backup.html*. Distributions
    with graphic environments such as Gnome and KDE usually include at least one graphic
    backup program. One possible backup solution on computers running Linux, Unix,
    or Mac OS X is to use `rsync` over SSH to an external system, and schedule it
    via `cron`. This doesn't have a nice graphical front end, but it gets the job
    done securely and efficiently, because `rsync` does not copy bytes across the
    network that already exist on the other side—it only copies the "changed" bytes.

    computer. BackupPC is a good choice as a server-side Linux backup program because
    it can back up Windows, Linux, and Mac computers through a network. BackupPC is
    available for download from [http://backuppc.sourceforge.net](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net).'

    is another server-side backup program that supports Windows and multiple versions
    of Linux and Unix.

- en: A server on a home network can do all the same things that a server on a business
    network can do, but many of those business functions are probably not particularly
    important at home. A typical home network server is mainly useful for storing
    and sharing files (such as music and videos), making automatic backups, and maybe
    hosting web pages and email.

- en: However, a local server is not always the best way to manage email or host web
    pages. Using the hosting services that are included with your Internet connection
    is often easier; a good hosting service will handle all of the security issues
    and other maintenance for you. Many Internet service providers will give you a
    separate email address for each family member and provide space on an existing
    web server for your family's web pages. Or if you prefer, you can obtain individual
    addresses from one or more of the free or low-cost email services such as Hotmail,
    Gmail, or any of the others described at [http://www.emailaddresses.com/](http://www.emailaddresses.com/).
    Adding one or more file servers to a network to share resources goes a long way
    toward increasing the value of your computers. You can certainly operate your
    small network without any servers, but like the network itself, a central storage
    location for documents, images, and other files is often a lot more convenient
    than storing everything on individual users' machines, especially if you can use
    an old computer as a server that would otherwise continue to collect dust in a
    storage closet.
