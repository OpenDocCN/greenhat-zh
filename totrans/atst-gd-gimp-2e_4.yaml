    as possible, for the least possible cost. GIMP can’t help you rein in your media
    costs or identify your target audience, but it can help you present a compelling
    product message. The tutorials in this chapter utilize GIMP tools you’ve already
    encountered in this book, building on skills you’ve developed and teaching you
    how to apply those skills to common advertising tasks.

    and limitations of the destination medium is an important part of the advertising
    design process. Creating web ads doesn’t require as much time, effort, or computer
    memory as creating print ads, but the nature of the Web limits advertising in
    many ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web ads are designed to be viewed on computer monitors, so the images are usually
    small and measured at the monitor’s resolution, typically 72 or 98 ppi. Web ads
    are also displayed in the same RGB format in which the images were created. For
    these reasons, they’re a bit easier to create than print ads, but because the
    monitor resolution and screen space are limited, web ads can’t show as much detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In comparison, print ads are usually larger and measured at higher resolutions
    (150 dpi to 300 dpi), which require far more computer memory to produce. Additionally,
    print ads created in RGB generally must be converted to the CMYK format the printer
    requires. Because GIMP doesn’t currently support direct manipulation of images
    in CMYK, your ads will be created in RGB, and the conversion process will have
    to be handled by the printer or a third-party service bureau.

    CMYK using International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles. Your personal printer
    probably has ICC profile files, and GIMP supports their use even if it doesn’t

    has opened up stock image collections to the masses and reduced the cost of those
    images in the process. These images are ideal for use in web ads because they’re
    inexpensive, of reasonable quality, and available in many sizes. Most stock image
    collections provide images in GIMP-supported formats such as TIFF and JPEG, and
    prices on low-cost stock image websites like BigStockPhoto.com, iStockphoto.com,
    and CanStockPhoto.com range from $1 to $5 per image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use low-cost stock images for some print ads, though for projects like
    posters and banners it may be best to use images from professional stock image
    collections instead. Professional stock image services usually offer much larger
    images, ones that are big enough to suit large-scale print projects. In addition
    to per-file downloads, professional stock image services may also sell complete
    CD collections or provide monthly subscriptions. Prices vary greatly, however.
    A single image might cost $80 to $200, while a CD collection might cost around
    $500\. Websites like ThinkStockPhotos.com and GettyImages.com charge approximately
    $199 per month and $1,200 per year for subscriptions.

    sizes. These image sizes are generally given in pixels, and you’ll want to buy
    the largest version of the image you can afford. This will allow you to scale
    down the image to a size appropriate for your project. Remember that the dots
    per inch (dpi) value for print ads (150 dpi to 300 dpi) is different from pixels
    per inch (ppi) for web ads (72 ppi or 98 ppi). An image that is 1,200 pixels wide
    is 4 inches wide when printed at 300 dpi for a magazine (300 dpi × 4 inches =
    1,200 pixels), but it’s over 16½ inches wide when printed at 72 dpi for the Web!

    are used effectively in print advertising. GIMP offers several tools for enhancing
    existing colors, among them the Curves, Levels, and Hue-Saturation tools. Each

    Brightness-Contrast tool is often used in conjunction with these other tools to
    make overall ambient lighting changes.

    users will prefer to work with GIMP when dealing with their digital photographs
    but might choose other tools like Inkscape or Scribus when working with text.

    only be done with those vector applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a design magazine. The goal of the project is to map an image onto text but keep
    the original image recognizable. In the original magazine article, the process
    was handled using Adobe InDesign, a vector layout tool. It does clever things
    with text using boxes to align and block objects within the layout. Fortunately,
    this particular effect turns out to be even easier to produce with GIMP than with
    InDesign.
  prefs: []

    This design requires a source image with sufficient color and contrast. Without
    color and contrast, the shapes within the image won’t be recognizable through
    the text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The project also requires a suitable font. The font should be thick and without
    any serifs. Serif fonts clutter the final image and in most cases won’t allow
    as much detail from the source image to be displayed, even when bold versions
    of the serif font are used. Serif fonts can also make text from the image difficult
    to recognize.

    shadows to make light appear to come from different directions. A rectangular

    a light source shining directly on the front of the box and that the box is set

    you can play with lighting in this project.

    tutorials you used lighting to simulate depth in an image. Shadows, too, provide
    a sense of depth by implying that another surface exists behind or below the main
    subject. Reflections can also be used to lend texture to a surface. In this tutorial
    you’ll learn how to use reflections to simulate a rounded, glassy surface.
  prefs: []

- en: This technique is easy to learn, but you may need to experiment to get the reflections
    just right. The trick is to create cutouts from an existing selection. And notice
    the use of paths in this tutorial—the two endpoints of a path will be connected
    when they are converted to a selection, and in this tutorial you want the line
    between those two endpoints to be outside an existing selection.

    by a shape representing the company, group, or individual. As part of an overall
    identity campaign, logos are sometimes embedded within other shapes to create
    emblems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the easiest emblems to create is a round, reflective logo that resembles
    glass. A glass logo uses soft gradients with little or no grain visible. Many
    white ovals (or partial ovals) are layered and placed over the logo to simulate
    reflections. Sometimes these round reflections are even outlined with distinct
    edges to simulate a frame in which the logo is set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A metallic logo is even easier to create. The technique is based on the fact
    that reflections in metal aren’t as wide as reflections in glass, and they have
    more high-contrast areas between light and shadow. In the case of a metallic logo,
    the metal might be the focal point—as in a belt buckle or lapel pin—or you might
    just use metallic edges to accent a nonmetallic design, which is what you’ll do
    in this tutorial.

    like glass buttons or even silver spoons. Notice how the light and colors reflect.
    One trick is to blur your eyes a little—try to see the reflections without focusing
    on the shape of the object. Then try to reproduce the effect with GIMP.
  prefs: []

- en: Adding reflectivity and color not only adds style to your design, it’s also
    incredibly easy to do with GIMP. In this tutorial you’ll work on a small canvas
    to demonstrate the ease of the technique. Remember that raster images—like those
    you create in GIMP—don’t scale up to larger sizes very well, so start with a larger
    canvas and scale up the *technique* if you need a bigger emblem.

    and drag handles. Path edits don’t immediately affect the image window; you have

    in a single path layer and then create multiple path layers to create a drawing.
    Since paths are editable curves, not just straight lines, they’re perfect for
    drawing manga or other types of cartoons. But there’s more to paths than cartoons.
    You’re going to use them as the basis for a 3-D shape.

    which is nifty if you’re into math but of less help to this type of design work.
    Ignore the dialog and just drag the handles in the image window. Then hit ENTER
    to accept the changes.

    Zoom out on the image window to drag handles outside the visible edge of the canvas.
    This will allow the perspective layer to flow out to the edge of the image and
    beyond. Of course, what flows outside the visible edge of the canvas won’t be
    included in the final image, but that’s a design choice.

    reason it couldn’t. In fact, adjusting the shadow provides a very specific feel
    to the design because it lets the viewer know the direction from where the light
    is shining.

    In the end, the simplicity of the iPod style is what makes it both easy to identify
    with and, for GIMP users, easy to reproduce.

- en: Light and shadows are the key components of 3-D effects. If you want to add
    an extra dimension to your work, first determine the direction of the lighting.
    Then use GIMP tools to increase the light on the surfaces that face the light
    and decrease the light on the surfaces that would be in shadow.

    shape like a circle or a rectangle can look like a reflection. Play with the Blend
    tool’s gradients—many of them can produce reflective effects.

    Map) both work quite well, but text-embossing effects are so easy to achieve,
    you might as well do things manually. Just duplicate, offset, blur, and cut. To
    make matters even easier, the blur and cut steps are optional.

  prefs:

- en: GIMP no longer leaves many “jaggies” after performing transforms such as rotations
    or shearing, but if you find any, you can apply a light blur to layer edges to
    clear those up. Zoom out to view the edges of a layer extending beyond the canvas
    area. A few jaggies along the edge of a package where the front and side images
    meet may not be such a bad thing—they can provide contrast to show there’s an
    actual edge where common colors blend. Blurring the jagged edges may give you
    even better contrast.

- en: Don’t try to align horizontal elements before applying perspective transformations
    when creating the front and side images for packaging projects. Applying a perspective
    change to any side will likely distort those horizontal elements so they become
    unaligned. Instead, avoid adding or using horizontal lines that need to align
    on the front and side of a package.

    size of a sheet of legal paper takes up 20 to 30MB just sitting there. Images
    destined for the Web are usually created at 98 ppi, however, and this greatly
    reduces the project’s file sizes.
