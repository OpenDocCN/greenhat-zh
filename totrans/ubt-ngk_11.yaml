- en: Firefox usually automatically recognizes the language in which a web page is
    written and thus displays the page correctly. Sometimes, however, the author of
    the page may neglect to include the character coding for that page in the HTML,
    in which case Firefox, not knowing that the page is prepared in another language,
    will very often open it in the default language of your system. The result is
    a page in which you see nothing but odd combinations of symbols and letters that
    have no meaning. In this case, try changing the character coding in Firefox to
    the language encoding you believe the page to be in. Some languages employ more
    than one encoding scheme, so if you're not sure, give each one a try. You can
    make your choices by going to the Firefox **View** menu and selecting **Character
    Encoding**. From the submenu there, you can select the appropriate coding for
    the language of that page.

    pressing a letter on the keyboard simply prints that letter to the screen. However,
    Chinese, Japanese, and Korean require a kind of conversion process that is handled
    by a special application (actually a set of applications) called an *input method
    editor (IME)*. Each of these languages has its own IME, and each is quite different
    because of the basic differences in the three writing systems.

    Chinese would be the most complicated system, because the writing system consists
    of thousands of characters, it is in fact the simplest. The Chinese IME simply
    takes the Romanized keyboard input, known as *pinyin*, and converts it into Chinese
    characters, or *Hanzi*. For the IME, it is essentially a simple dictionary lookup
    task—big dictionary, simple IME. In the event that there is more than one character
    for the pinyin input, a list of possible candidates will appear, and the user
    can then simply select the appropriate character from that list. More recent Chinese
    IMEs also have predictive capabilities, by which they judge what you are trying
    to type on the basis of what you've typed so far ([Figure 11-6](ch11s03.html#chinese_imes_can_predict_what_you_apostr
    "Figure 11-6. Chinese IMEs can predict what you're going to write . . . kind of.")).

    it has three writing systems to deal with: *Kanji* (ideographic characters borrowed
    long ago from China), *hiragana* (the phono-alphabetic system used mainly for
    tense and case endings), and *katakana* (used mainly for words borrowed from other
    languages). Still, the standard input method for Japanese is primarily via the
    standard Roman keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-function keys. Thus,
    typing in Japanese is a two-step process whereby the IME first converts the romanized
    text into hiragana as it is typed and then converts it to appropriate Kanji, katakana,
    or hiragana elements after the spacebar is pressed.'
  prefs: []

    IME has already converted the Romanized input on the fly. It has converted *rinakkusdenihongonyuuryokugamodekimasu*
    (which means *You can input Japanese in Linux*) to hiragana. When a line of hiragana
    is highlighted, it means that the line has not yet been converted beyond that.
    In the second line, however, the user has subsequently pressed the spacebar, which
    caused the IME to convert the hiragana string into the appropriate Kanji, hiragana,
    and katakana elements. The first word, *Linux*, has been converted to katakana
    text, because it is a borrowed word, while *Japanese input* has been converted
    to Kanji; the rest stays in hiragana.

    is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called *Hangul*, or in a combination
    of Hangul and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese called *Hanja*. While
    the Hanja characters are essentially the same as their Chinese and Japanese counterparts,
    Hanzi and Kanji, the Korean phonetic alphabet, Hangul, has it own unique appearance,
    as you can see in the Korean word for Korea, *Hangug(k)*, in [Figure 11-8](ch11s03.html#korea_open_parenthesis_hangug_close_pare

    Korean is very unique in the way that its alphabetic characters are put to the

    other languages written with an alphabet, Hangul letters are grouped in pairs,
    triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a general rule, clockwise.
    The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually based on a Korean alphabetical
    keyboard layout) while it is being typed, and it must adjust the size, spacing,
    and positioning of each of the letters as it puts them into appropriate clusters
    (see [Figure 11-9](ch11s03.html#an_example_of_the_clustering_process_in "Figure 11-9. An

    start up and be ready for action when you need to use it.

    adding it to your system's list of startup applications. To do this, select **Preferences**
    ▸ **Startup Applications**, and in the Startup Applications Preferences window,
    click the **Add** button. In the Name box type **`Ibus`**, and in the Command
    box type **`/usr/bin/ibus-daemon -d`**. When done, click **Add**, and then close
    the Startup Applications Preferences window.

    able to install language support for languages other than English and come up
    with a whole new system in a different language. On one of my machines, I have
    installed support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and my default, English. With
    just a simple logout and a few more clicks, I can log back in with an interface
    in a totally different language. I can have a Chinese, Japanese, or Swedish system
    whenever I want.

    same native language. At my former university, for example, where my Japanese
    and Chinese students sometimes used my computer, the additional language support
    allowed them to log in using their own language. It's even pretty handy if you
    are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself as much exposure as
    possible to it. All in all, it is a very useful feature.

    all you have to do is install a group of support files for each language you want
    to add to your system. You can do this by going to the **System** ▸ **Administration**
    ▸ **Language Support**, after which the Language window will appear. In that window,
    click the **Install/Remove Languages** button. In the Installed Languages window
    that then appears, choose from the various languages available by checking the
    appropriate boxes. If you are installing language support for languages with complex
    writing systems, such as Japanese, be sure to also check the boxes next to the
    words *Input methods* and *Extra fonts* ([Figure 11-17](ch11s06.html#selecting_additional_languages_to_instal
    "Figure 11-17. Selecting additional languages to install")).

    will be prompted for your password at this point, so provide what is required,
    and the Language Support tool will begin downloading and then installing the support
    packages you specified. Once it is done, you will be notified and left with the
    Language window.

    choose to have your system open in a different language environment by using the
    Language window (**System** ▸ **Administration** ▸ **Language Support**). In the
    language tab of that window, select the language you want to use when you next
    log in, and drag it to the top of the list ([Figure 11-18](ch11s06.html#selecting_the_language_in_which_you_want
    "Figure 11-18. Selecting the language in which you want your system to appear
    when you next log in")). For languages with complex input systems, you can also
    select your input method of choice, such as IBus, in the menu button next to the
    words *Keyboard input method system*. You can then close the window, log out,
    and then log in again, after which your system will appear in the language you
    chose.

    Once you click your name in the list of users, a set of menus will appear in a
    panel at the bottom of the screen. Choose the language you want to use from the
    Language menu in that panel. If the language you want is not there and you know
    that you installed it, select **Other**, and then select the language you are
    looking for in the window that appears. Once done, click **OK**, and then proceed
    to log in normally.

    usually does. Depending on what language you've chosen, once your desktop appears
    you will be in another linguistic world. Your menus, applications, and even the
    little tips windows that pop up when you run your mouse over a panel icon will
    all be in the newly selected language ([Figure 11-19](ch11s06.html#the_applications_and_internet_menus_show
