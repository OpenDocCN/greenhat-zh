    beret of yours and address the artistic side of things. Yes, Linux does art, and
    as you will soon find out, a good number of programs on your system allow you
    to create and manipulate graphic files. These days, however, there is perhaps
    nothing as important to most users' graphical repertoires as their digital cameras,
    so that is where we'll begin.

- en: Although scanner support for Linux can prove a bit spotty, support for digital
    cameras is practically a worry-free affair. In fact, if Ubuntu can't figure out
    what kind of camera you have, it just treats it as if it were an external hard
    drive or flash drive plugged into your computer's USB port. And even if your camera
    doesn't seem to communicate with your computer when connected directly, you can
    still transfer your images to your hard disk by removing the memory card from
    your camera, inserting it into a USB flash memory card reader, and plugging that
    reader into one of your computer's USB ports. In that case, your system will mount
    the card reader as if it were an external drive (which is pretty much what it
    is), thus allowing you to copy the images to your hard disk. Of course, you can
    use this method even if your camera works just fine with Ubuntu—some people find
    it to be the easiest way to deal with things, anyway.

    out and find exactly what you need. Fortunately, F-Spot has a few ways of making
    this easier to deal with, one of which is the timeline slider, located immediately
    above the thumbnail-viewing pane, which allows you to locate images by year and
    month.
  prefs: []

    version of the tag icon will appear below the image, as you can see in [Figure 13-6](ch13s02.html#using_f-spot_apostrophy_s_tags_feature_t

    the pop-up menu. In the window that appears, click the iconless button next to
    the word *Icon*, and then select one of the predefined icons in the window that
    appears. You can also use this approach to edit the photo of an automatically
    created tag, which allows you to determine exactly what portion of a picture you
    want to use as the icon for that tag ([Figure 13-7](ch13s02.html#modifying_the_portion_of_photo_used_as_a

    Selected Tag**. A find bar will then appear directly above the thumbnail-viewing
    area of the F-Spot window. Drag the icon for the Events tag to that find bar,
    and almost immediately images tagged as *Events* will appear in the thumbnail

    give your image a canvas texture, change a photo into an oil painting, and even

    extension for the format you want to convert the image to. If you're not sure
    what formats are available to you, click the small arrow to the left of the words

    without mentioning one of the newest entries in the Linux application arena—Picasa.
    Those of you coming from the Windows and Mac worlds are no doubt familiar with
    this very popular image-viewing, organizing, and editing application from Google,
    and you will no doubt be pleased to discover that it is available for Linux. Picasa
    is not an open source application, which may cause some Linux diehards to turn
    away, but it is free, feature rich, nice to look at, and decidedly cool ([Figure 13-12](ch13s07.html#picasa
    "Figure 13-12. Picasa")). It also gives you easy access to various online photo
    blogs, photo finishers, and product providers, such as PhotoStamps, Shutterfly,
    Kodak, and even Walgreens.

    [http://picasa.google.com/linux](http://picasa.google.com/linux), and click the
    **Download Picasa for Linux** button. Once on the download page, click the appropriate
    download link (that would be the one under *For Debian/Ubuntu i386* if you're
    using the disc in this book).

- en: After the download is complete, locate the Picasa DEB package on your hard disk,
    and double-click it. Click the **Install Package** button in the Package Installer
    window that appears. Provide your password if prompted for it, and then click
    **OK** to begin the installation. When the installation process is complete, you
    will be notified in the installation progress window. After that, you can close
    both that and the Package Installer window.

    and selecting **Graphics** ▸ **Picasa** ▸ **Picasa** or **Other** ▸ **Picasa**
    (the location varies, even with difference user accounts on the same computer!).
    The first time you do this, you will be greeted by a warning window telling you
    that Picasa can be integrated with GNOME so that whenever you hook up a digital
    camera to your computer, GNOME will run Picasa in order to handle the photo importation
    process. Make the choice you feel most comfortable with, after which another window
    about Picasa/Firefox integration will appear (click **OK**), and then finally
    a Picasa License Agreement window will appear. Agree to what you're asked by clicking
    **Next** and then in the next screen **I Agree**.

    it finds to its library.

    out more, check out [http://picasa.google.com/linux/](http://picasa.google.com/linux/).

    (including FAQ and forum pages), and a Picasa Getting Started Guide.

    are still more available. You can grab all of them via the Ubuntu Software Center.
    Although you can experiment with what's available, I will point out a few others
    worth noting. If nothing else, these applications will give you an idea of the
    breadth of stuff out there waiting for you.

- en: In earlier editions of Ubuntu, an application called gThumb ([Figure 13-13](ch13s08.html#gthumb
    "Figure 13-13. gThumb")), handy for use in photo-handling chores, used to come
    preinstalled. Some folks wish it still did. It has almost all the same features
    as F-Spot and a few of its own (such as creating original web album pages and
    some limited batch conversion capabilities). That said, it all really boils down
    to whether you prefer F-Spot or gThumb (or even Picasa, for that matter). They're
    all free and easy to use, so try them all to see which you like. If you do, install
    gThumb via the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for *gthumb*. Once installed,
    run it by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Graphics** ▸ **gThumb Image Viewer**.

- en: Perhaps one of the most impressive open source applications available today
    is Blender. Blender ([Figure 13-14](ch13s08.html#blender-id1 "Figure 13-14. Blender"))
    is a professional-level 3D modeling, animation, and rendering program. It is rather
    complex, but that is the source of its power and popularity (it comes in versions
    for just about every operating system out there). If you would like to find out
    a bit more about Blender before taking the time (and disk space) to install it,
    go to [http://www.blender3d.org/](http://www.blender3d.org/). Find it via the
    Ubuntu Software Center by searching for *blender*; once the program is installed,
    you can run it by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Graphics** ▸ **Blender (fullscreen)**
    or **Blender (windowed)**.

    systems is QCad ([Figure 13-15](ch13s08.html#qcad-id1 "Figure 13-15. QCad")).
    QCad is a 2D computer-aided design (CAD) program with which you can create technical
    drawings such as room interiors, machine parts, or even musical instruments. (I've
    seen a plan for a Nyckelharpa done on QCad!) To find out more, go to the project
    home page at [http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html/](http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html/).
    Search the Ubuntu Software Center for *qcad*, and install the application. Once
    it is installed, you can run it by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Graphics** ▸
    **QCad**.

    us) and have a look at Tux Paint. With its big colorful buttons and fun and funky
    tools, Tux Paint, shown in [Figure 13-16](ch13s08.html#tux_paint-id1 "Figure 13-16. Tux
    Paint"), is an application that your children can handle and enjoy. The best of
    Tux Paint's features (at least in my opinion) are its stamps, of which there is
    a good variety—everything from apples to seahorses and euro coins to boot! Oh,
    yes, and it talks to you. Click a duck stamp, and not only will you hear a voice
    say "duck," but you will also hear the "quack quack" we've come to associate with
    our green-necked friends. Search the Ubuntu Software Center for *tuxpaint*, and,
    once installed, launch it from **Applications** ▸ **Education** ▸ **Tux Paint**.
