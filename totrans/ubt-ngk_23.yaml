- en: 'As I mentioned in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. BECOMING A PENGUINISTA"),
    the version of the Ubuntu Desktop CD that comes with this book is designed to
    work with i386 processors, either in PCs or Intel-based Macs. It will also work
    with AMD64 or Intel Core 2 processors, albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to
    use Ubuntu with these processors (or any other machine based on AMD64 or EM64T
    architecture) in 64-bit mode, you must get a different disc on your own. There
    are several ways of doing this: downloading an ISO (disc image) and then burning
    it to CD yourself, ordering the CD from Ubuntu (for free), or ordering it from
    an online Linux CD provider (for a nominal cost).'

    find the link to the download page, and then select and download the appropriate
    version for your machine. Remember that the ISO file you will be downloading is
    a heavyweight, weighing in at just under 700MB, so the download will take a bit
    of time. Don't count on getting it all downloaded and done before dinner . . .
    or, if you happen to be using a dial-up Internet connection, before dinner tomorrow.
    Yikes!

- en: Once the Ubuntu Desktop CD ISO has been downloaded, you need to burn it to CD
    before you can use it. Although Windows has built-in CD-writing capabilities,
    not all versions have the built-in ability to burn ISOs. To burn an ISO to CD
    in Windows 7, just right-click the ISO file, select **Burn disc image**, and then
    click the **Burn** button in the window that appears. In all other versions of
    Windows, however, you must use a third-party commercial application, such as Nero.
    If you don't have a commercial disc-burning utility installed on your system,
    try the free and handy ISO Recorder.

    Once the download is complete, double-click the *ISORecorderSetup.msi* file on
    your hard disk to install it. After the installation is complete, burn your ISO
    to CD by right-clicking the Ubuntu ISO file on your machine and selecting **Open
    with** ▸ **ISO Recorder** in the pop-up menu. A CD Recording Wizard window will
    appear.

- en: It is generally best if you burn installation or live CDs at a lower speed than
    the maximum speed allowed by your drive in order to reduce the chance of error
    (with 2X to 4X speeds considered optimal). To do so, make your choice from the
    Recording speed drop-down menu. Next, pop a blank CD into the drive, and click
    the **Next** button. The CD-burning process should begin. Once it's done, the
    CD should pop out of the drive, and if all goes well, you'll have yourself an
    AMD64-compatible live CD. You can then use it by following the directions at the
    beginning of [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING") for using the
    live CD that comes with this book.

    installed and run on Intel-based Macs. You can also, of course, download ISOs
    for other architectures on your Mac and then burn them to CD for use on other
    machines.

    not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disc in the area at the
    top portion of the left pane. If the disc is mounted, a drive icon will appear
    in that location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to that entry
    to eject, or *unmount*, it.

    for and open the **Utilities** folder. In that folder, find and then double-click
    **Disk Utility**. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility
    window when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD
    ISO you just downloaded, and then drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility
    window, just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file appears
    in that list, click it once to highlight it.

    toolbar, and then insert a blank CD in your drive when prompted to do so. Once
    the blank disc is inserted and recognized, you will be able to adjust the burn
    speed from the drop-down menu next to the word *Speed*. Select as low a speed
    as your hardware will allow, which, depending on the age of your Mac, will probably
    be 4X to 8X. Finally, click the **Burn** button in that same window, and the burning
    process will begin.

- en: The easiest and most foolproof way to get an Ubuntu Desktop CD is to simply
    order one (or more) for free from Ubuntu; you don't even have to pay shipping
    or handling. Of course, the only downside to this approach is time. It can take
    up to ten weeks for you to get the CDs in this manner, so if you're impatient,
    you might want to opt for one of the other methods. To order your install CDs
    from Ubuntu, go to [https://shipit.ubuntu.com/](https://shipit.ubuntu.com/), and
    follow the directions there. It's easy.

    a small amount for the service, then you can order your discs through the Canonical
    store instead ([https://shop.canonical.com/](https://shop.canonical.com/)).
