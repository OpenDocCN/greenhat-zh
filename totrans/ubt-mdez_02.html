Better yet is the fact that, unlike earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don’t need an additional installation CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu CD functions as both a live CD and an installation disc. And in the good-better-best swing of things, the best point of all is that installation from the live CD is actually much, much easier than any other installation process you’ve ever dealt with, and it even gives you more than one way to go about it.</p><p>In this chapter, I will cover the basics of starting up and running Ubuntu from the live CD and then, assuming you’ve caught the Linux bug, the painless steps of installing Ubuntu on your hard disk as your operating system, either in its own partition on your hard disk in a traditional dual-boot setup (with Windows in its own partition) or, for the slightly less adventurous, from within your Windows system.</p><p>If your computer doesn’t have a CD drive, don’t worry, you can still join in. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Installing Ubuntu from a USB Flash Drive">Appendix A</a> to see how you can run or install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive instead. Whatever way you end up going about things, let’s put this book to use and get Ubuntu up and running.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0004"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Going for a Dip"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="going_for_a_dip"/>Going for a Dip</h1></div></div></div><p>To get a taste of what Ubuntu is all about (and to check out your hardware to see whether it’s all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the Ubuntu CD in your disc drive and restart your machine. When the machine starts up, it should boot up from the CD, and after a second or two, you should see a purple Ubuntu startup screen with a couple of icons at the bottom of it. If the screen does not appear and your machine instead boots up into your usual operating system, then very likely your machine’s BIOS settings need to be changed to allow you to boot from a CD. Worry not: Although the procedure might sound rather technical, altering the BIOS settings isn’t much of a hassle.</p><p>You can access your machine’s BIOS by restarting and then pressing whatever key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS setup. This is usually <span class="keycap">delete</span> or F1, but F2, F10, F12, and <span class="keycap">esc</span> are also common—not all machines are the same. If the onscreen information passes by so fast that you miss it, you can check your user’s manual to see what the correct key is.</p><p>Once you get into the BIOS setup, change the boot sequence so that your CD drive is first. To do this, you’ll probably have to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate between different options and the <span class="keycap">enter</span> key to select them. Basic instructions on how to do this are normally displayed onscreen. When you’re finished, make sure you save your changes and then restart the computer.</p><p>Once your machine boots from the live CD and you see the purple Ubuntu startup screen, either you can wait for a few seconds for Ubuntu to start booting into the live CD proper, or you can press a key (any key) to display a menu where you can choose your language and other settings. The default settings should suffice for our purposes, so leave the keyboard untouched for a few seconds, and the purple screen will give way to a loading screen (also purple).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you decide to explore this menu, you’ll find that you have to make a choice as to how you proceed once you’ve chosen a language and so forth. Select <span class="emphasis"><em>Try without installing</em></span> to get back on the right track.</p></div><p>After a couple of minutes or so, the loading screen will disappear, and in its place will come an Install window with a swooshy purple desktop background behind it (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#the_ubuntu_live_cdas_install_window" title="Figure 2-1. The Ubuntu live CD’s Install window">Figure 2-1</a>). Click Try Ubuntu, and the Install window will give way to a pristine Ubuntu desktop with a row of colorful icons down the left side and the same purple background. You should now be able to use your mouse as well as the keyboard, so feel free to explore. And remember, your hard disk will go untouched, so rest easy—you’re not going to change, let alone hurt, anything. When you get to this point, you’re ready to take Ubuntu for a spin—but I’ll hold off on talking about that until <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A New Place to Call Home">Chapter 3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_ubuntu_live_cdas_install_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e1113"/><img alt="The Ubuntu live CD’s Install window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263420.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-1. The Ubuntu live CD’s Install window</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Special input mechanisms that are required for typing certain languages (that is, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are not supported in live CD sessions.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0009"/></p></div><p>If you’d like to get out of the CD and return your computer to normal, click the power button at the very top right of the screen (it looks like a cross between a regular power icon and a gear), choose <span class="strong"><strong>Shut Down</strong></span>, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span> again from the window that appears.

Things have changed, however, because there is now an installation option called Wubi that lets you install Ubuntu directly on your Windows C: drive as if it were any other Windows program. Once it’s installed, every time you start up your machine, you’ll be able to choose between starting up into Windows or into Ubuntu from the Windows bootloader screen. Your Windows system stays as it is; you don’t have to partition your hard disk, and if you want to get rid of Ubuntu later for whatever reason, you can do so as you would any other Windows application. It’s a great way to go about things for the faint of heart.</p><p>Admittedly, this approach could be described as a half measure, in that it doesn’t give you the full experience you would get from a dedicated Ubuntu installation. It’s not as robust as a full Ubuntu installation, and it takes longer to install because Wubi needs to download the installation files from the Internet (the right ones aren’t on the CD). But it is a pretty good compromise—it definitely runs quicker and is much, much more usable and enjoyable than an Ubuntu live CD session. You also have the added benefit of being able to save files and settings to disk, which means you can follow along with anything described in this book. Pretty cool.</p><p>If this alternative installation approach doesn’t seem appealing to you, move on to <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#taking_the_full_plungeminstalling_ubuntu" title="Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows">Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#taking_the_full_plungeminstalling_ubuntu" title="Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows">Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows</a>.

If you do, then you’re going to have to decide whether you want to keep it.</p><p>It is possible to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same machine and for them to happily coexist. This is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>dual-boot</em></span> setup. It has become incredibly easy to set up such a system. I started out with a dual-boot setup, though I eventually found that I used the Linux side of things exclusively. Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I didn’t use seemed a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped the whole thing and went for a straight Linux-only setup.</p><p>My feeling is that you should try the Wubi route of installing Ubuntu inside Windows first and then, when you’re ready, go for a Linux-only setup and ditch Windows completely. Most people find that Ubuntu can do everything they need, so there’s no need to dual-boot unless you require some specific application that has no equivalent on Linux.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0021"/></p><p>If you do opt for a dual-boot setup, starting up in either system is easy. When you start up your machine, you will be greeted by the GRand Unified Bootloader (better known as GRUB) screen, from which you can choose to continue booting up Linux or to boot up in Windows instead. After that, bootup proceeds as normal for the system you selected.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0022"/></p><p>So whichever way you decide to go, you really can’t go wrong. Just be sure to back up your important files before starting the installation. Proceed with common sense, patience, and a positive attitude, and you’ll be fine. In short, don’t worry.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Ready for Action"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_ready_for_action"/>Getting Ready for Action</h2></div></div></div><p>You need to do less to prepare for an Ubuntu installation than for many other Linux distributions. Once you’ve decided whether you want to go the dual-boot route, all you really need to have on hand is your single Ubuntu CD and, for guidance and security, this book. The only mental energy you’ll probably expend is in coming up with a username and user password, just as you do for most other operating systems.</p><div class="sect3" title="Usernames and User Passwords"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="usernames_and_user_passwords"/>Usernames and User Passwords</h3></div></div></div><p>Your username is something that you will be seeing quite a bit. It will be on permanent display in the top right-hand corner of the screen, among other things, so be sure it is something you can live with. It can be just your first name or your initials or whatever you want it to be. It must, however, begin with a lowercase letter, followed by numbers and/or other lowercase letters. Mine, for example, is simply <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>, but you could use something like <span class="emphasis"><em>hope4u2pal</em></span>, though that would get rather tiring to look at. You also need to come up with a user password, which you will need to type every time you log in. You will need to use it when you install new software or change certain system settings, as well. It should be a minimum of eight characters in length and consist of numbers, letters (upper- and lowercase), and symbols for improved security. The harder it is for someone to guess, the better. You can, of course, get by with fewer characters and only letters if you prefer. The installer will advise you if the password you enter is unacceptable, so don’t worry about this. Be sure to write it down and keep the paper you’ve written it on in a safe place, at least for a little while, so you don’t accidentally lock yourself out of your system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0023"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you have experience working with other Linux distributions, you may be surprised to learn that the root account is disabled by default in Ubuntu. There is, therefore, no installation step for inputting a root password. You can check the forums (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) to learn ways of getting around this setup. You can also set up a root password at any time after the system is installed, so if having a root account is important to you, don’t worry.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0024"/></p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Doing the Deed"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="doing_the_deed"/>Doing the Deed</h2></div></div></div><p>Well, now that I’ve covered all that preliminary stuff, let’s get down to the actual Linux installation. Set this book on your lap so you can follow along, and then get ready for action. It’s time to do the deed!</p><p>Fortunately for you, the installation process is extremely easy, because there are very few steps in which you actually have to do anything. Most of what you will be doing is clicking buttons on your screen. Nothing hard about that, eh?</p><p>Of course, when you look at the directions and descriptions listed here, the process may look like a long and cumbersome one. It’s not. It will be over more quickly than you can imagine. As a beginner frequently referring to this text, you might take a bit longer, of course, but all in all the process is faster and easier than that for Windows or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that with Windows and OS X, you are installing the operating system with just a few bundled applications. In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, you are installing not only the operating system itself but also most of the applications you will ever want or need to use. You will thus be getting a lot done in one fell swoop.</p><p>One more thing before we start. Some people approach installing a system with a good deal of trepidation. The process makes them nervous, as if the house is going to go up in smoke if they click the wrong thing. Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as you have backed up your data, ideally to an external hard disk or similar, you will be okay. If you screw up the installation the first time out, so what? Just start over. No harm done, because you have nothing to harm—all your files are safe and secure in your backup copy. Just make sure that you give yourself more time than you need for the process. Don’t start installing an hour before you have to be at work or before you have to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes people do weird things. Make things easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty of time and, as I mentioned before, by backing up any data you would mourn the loss of.</p><p>If you’re ready—and why wouldn’t you be?—here are the steps:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0025"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Start ’er up</strong></span>.

A partition is an area of your hard disk that is “cordoned off” from other areas of the disk. It’s a useful way of keeping things such as operating systems separate. Because they are isolated from each other, different partitions are treated as if they are different hard disks attached to your computer, even though they’re actually on the same physical hard disk.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0035"/></p><p>Most computers have just one partition that fills up the entire hard disk. This is like having a house with a completely open floor plan—the whole house is just one big room. If you want to completely remove Windows and install Ubuntu instead, Ubuntu can happily take over the entire partition (and thus the entire disk) and kick out the former resident, Windows.</p><p>If you want to install two operating systems on the same computer, you have to give each one its own partition (after all, they need their privacy). Back with the house analogy, it’s like erecting a partition wall to carve up the house into two rooms. If you choose to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, the installer will automatically do this partitioning for you. Of course, you can choose how big each partition is: The bigger you make the Ubuntu partition, the more disk space will be available to you in Ubuntu (and the less in Windows). After all, the house is the same size; it’s just the position of the dividing wall that you’re changing.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0038"/></p><p>You can find some information on manually partitioning your hard disk in <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk">Appendix C</a>, if you fancy taking control of the process yourself. There should be no need to, however, since the Ubuntu installer will be happy to handle the task for you.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Keeping in mind that this is the point of no return, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install Now</strong></span> button. A progress bar will appear at the bottom of the window, and the installation process will begin.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Specify your location and keyboard type</strong></span>. It will take a while to install everything, so in the meantime, the installer will ask a few questions that it will use to set up your user account. The first question asks you to specify your location; do this by clicking on the world map to select a nearby city.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> and choose your keyboard layout from the list. The installer should automatically select the right one, or you can try clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Detect Keyboard Layout</strong></span>. You can test that it works as expected by typing into the box provided; pay special attention to quotation marks, the pound and @ symbols, and similar keys, since these are the ones you’re most likely to have trouble with. When you’re happy, click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> again.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Enter user account details</strong></span>. The Who are you? screen will appear (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#providing_your_username_comma_password_c" title="Figure 2-8. Providing your username, password, and computer name in the installation wizard screen">Figure 2-8</a>). This is probably the most fun one—you get to choose the name of your computer, your username, and a password. Enter your name first, at the top. The installer will make suggestions for some of the other fields, but you don’t have to take them. For the computer name, choose something short and simple with no spaces. Ditto for the username—as I mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#usernames_and_user_passwords" title="Usernames and User Passwords">Usernames and User Passwords</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#taking_the_full_plungeminstalling_ubuntu" title="Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows">Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside of Windows</a>, it’ll be a constant presence on your computer screen, so best not to choose anything that might eventually become irritating.

Although this will necessarily increase the time between switching on the computer and the Ubuntu desktop’s appearance, putting a password entry box in the way makes it much more difficult for anyone to gain access to your computer and all of the precious (and potentially confidential) files stored on it.</p><p>When you’re done, click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> to move on to the next step.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The security-conscious among you might consider selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Encrypt my home folder</strong></span> option. This will scramble the contents of your Home folder (where all your documents are stored) so that no one can see any of the files in it without your password. It won’t affect how you access your files, however, as they are descrambled for you when you log in. This is nice to have if you work with confidential information, since the data will be pretty safe even if your computer is stolen.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Migrate documents and settings</strong></span>. If your machine already has another operating system on it and you are setting up a dual-boot system, the installer will scan your hard disk to try to find certain settings, folders, and documents that it can automatically transfer to your new Ubuntu system environment. This step shouldn’t really matter, because you (hopefully!) made backup copies of all your important documents and settings before you started the installation. Still, it’s more convenient than copying everything from that backup onto your new Ubuntu system manually after the installation has finished. If a migration window appears, just check the boxes next to the items you want to transfer and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-2-0044"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Wait for installation to finish</strong></span>. Now, with all of your details having been entered, the installer will continue to do its thing. Sit back and watch the Ubuntu slideshow. The progress of the installation will be indicated in the progress bar below it so that you don’t have to fret (and so you’ll know how much more time you have left to veg out in front of the TV).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The installation is complete</strong></span>. You’ll be notified of this fact in a new window. You will be given the option of either continuing to use the live CD or restarting the machine and running Ubuntu directly from your hard disk. Well, you didn’t go through all of this just to keep using the live CD, so let’s go for the second option by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Restart Now</strong></span> button, removing the live CD from your drive when it’s automatically ejected, and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span> when prompted to do so. Your machine will then restart.</p></li></ol></div><p>After that . . . well, that’s basically it. You now have Ubuntu installed on your machine.
