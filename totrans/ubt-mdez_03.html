You’ve got Ubuntu installed, it is up and running, and you are ready and rarin’ to go. If you are running Ubuntu from your hard disk, the first thing you may see, depending on how you set things up, is the login screen that will appear each and every time you boot up (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_ubuntu_login_screen-id1" title="Figure 3-1. The Ubuntu login screen">Figure 3-1</a>). If so, type in your password and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, and you’ll be face to face with the Ubuntu desktop. If you set up your system during installation to bypass the login phase, or if you are still running Ubuntu from the live disc, you’re already there. Either way, let’s get down to getting to know your new home.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0001"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_ubuntu_login_screen-id1"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1731"/><img alt="The Ubuntu login screen" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263436.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-1. The Ubuntu login screen</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Welcome to the Desktop"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="welcome_to_the_desktop"/>Welcome to the Desktop</h1></div></div></div><p>As you can see at first glance, the Ubuntu desktop (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_unity_desktop_in_ubuntu" title="Figure 3-2. The Unity desktop in Ubuntu">Figure 3-2</a>) is a pretty familiar looking place. In fact, it looks a lot like what you might be used to in Windows, Mac OS, or even another Linux distribution. Look a bit closer, however, and you start to notice that things are not quite the same. There is no task bar or Start button at the bottom of the screen, there are no desktop icons, there seems to be only one menu in the top panel, and there is something that looks like the Mac OS X Dock on the left side of the screen. Yup, things are a bit different.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0003"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_unity_desktop_in_ubuntu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1752"/><img alt="The Unity desktop in Ubuntu" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263438.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-2. The Unity desktop in Ubuntu</p></div><p>Welcome to the Unity desktop environment, which Ubuntu has been using since its 11.04 release. Unity is designed to be usable on any number of devices, not just on PCs, meaning that someday you could conceivably be using the exact same operating system on your PC, your phone, your tablet computer, and who knows what else. Although Unity is a bit different from what you might be used to in terms of operation, it isn’t completely alien, and working in Unity quickly becomes second nature. To get you started, I’ll try to familiarize you with the elements of the desktop and how they all work.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0006"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Parts of the Unity Desktop Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="parts_of_the_unity_desktop_environment"/>Parts of the Unity Desktop Environment</h1></div></div></div><p>Ubuntu’s Unity desktop has three readily observable parts: the top panel, the desktop itself, and, on the left side of the screen, the Launcher.

And like the Mac OS menu bar, the panel contains the <span class="emphasis"><em>global menu</em></span>, which displays the menus for the currently focused application (unlike in Windows or other Linux distributions, where the menus are connected to the application window itself). To show the global menu, hover your mouse over the top left portion of the panel, and the menu will appear to the right of the window title (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_top_panel_does_double-duty_as_the_me" title="Figure 3-4. The top panel does double-duty as the menu bar for the system itself and most applications">Figure 3-4</a>).

(The <span class="emphasis"><em>title bar</em></span> is the bar that runs across the top of a window, where the title of the window and its controls are located.) This shouldn’t be a problem, of course, but it is something to bear in mind so you don’t panic when you can’t find the top of your window under the top panel. It’s not under the panel—it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the panel! Fortunately this seemingly mysterious metamorphosis is easily altered. To get your window back to its earlier, normal size, just double-click the top panel or click the maximize button again on the left end of the panel.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_top_panel_becomes_the_menu_and_title"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e1915"/><img alt="The top panel becomes the menu and title bar of a maximized window." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263446.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-6. The top panel becomes the menu and title bar of a maximized window.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="The Desktop"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_desktop"/>The Desktop</h2></div></div></div><p>The biggest part of the Unity desktop environment is the desktop itself. This is completely empty out of the box, so to speak, and it is not as thoroughly utilized as it is in Windows and Mac OS systems or even in other Linux desktop environments. This is not to say that you can’t use the desktop in some of the ways you might be familiar with, but as is, there are basically just two things you can put there as is: documents and folders. To create a folder on the desktop, just right-click anywhere on the desktop and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Fold</strong></span>er. You can then drag, or copy and paste, anything you want to that folder. Of course, if you want to drag your documents or folders to the desktop, you can do that too.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0016"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Launcher"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_launcher"/>The Launcher</h2></div></div></div><p>The most unfamiliar part of the Unity desktop environment will likely be the Launcher. The <span class="strong"><strong>Launcher</strong></span>, as I mentioned earlier, is that strip of icons that appears on the left side of the desktop. In some ways the Launcher functions very much like the Mac OS Dock. Out of the box, it comes with <span class="emphasis"><em>Launcher icons</em></span> for some of the most commonly used applications, folders, and utilities. Also, just as in the Mac Dock, when you run any other application, a Launcher icon for that application also appears.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0017"/></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Working with the Launcher"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="working_with_the_launcher"/>Working with the Launcher</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that you’re familiar with the parts of the Unity desktop environment, it is time to look at them in more detail. Since the Launcher is such a conspicuous (and important!) part of the desktop, I’ll start there. By default, the Launcher contains a smattering of icons, which are essentially shortcut buttons that help you get to the most important tools and applications in your system. Starting from the top, here’s what you’ll find:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0018"/></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>The Dash</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Probably the most important part of your system, the Dash is the place from where you more or less do it all: finding and running documents, applications, and other files on your system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0019"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Home folder</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Here’s where all your files are stored and drives and devices shown.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Firefox</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This is the default web browser in Ubuntu.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>LibreOffice Writer</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This is Ubuntu’s bundled word processor.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>LibreOffice Calc</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>And this is the spreadsheet application that comes with Ubuntu.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>LibreOffice Impress</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Here you find Ubuntu’s PowerPoint alternative.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Ubuntu Software Center</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>All the applications and other support files available for Ubuntu are accessed here.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Ubuntu One</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This helps you to install, set up, and connect to Ubuntu’s Ubuntu One service, which provides you with your own “personal cloud.” From here you can share files among your various devices.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0021"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>System Settings</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Opens the System Settings window, which is an access point to commonly used system settings such as keyboards, monitors, sound, network, and more.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Workplace Switcher</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Reveals and allows you to switch among the various usually unseen portions of your desktop workspace.

If you right-click any icon in the Launcher, a menu will appear with choices that vary by the item and whether or not it is already running or open. At the very least, you will be given the choice to lock the icon to the Launcher or to unlock it from the Launcher. The only exceptions to the lock/unlock option are the Dash, Trash, and System Switcher. Those stay where they are, like it or not. For many other Launcher icons, there are other options, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#right-clicking_launcher_icons_reveals_av" title="Figure 3-7. Right-clicking Launcher icons reveals available submenu options.">Figure 3-7</a>, which shows those for LibreOffice Writer.</p><div class="figure"><a id="right-clicking_launcher_icons_reveals_av"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2059"/><img alt="Right-clicking Launcher icons reveals available submenu options." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263448.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-7. Right-clicking Launcher icons reveals available submenu options.</p></div><p>As I just mentioned, you can easily lock additional icons to the Launcher or remove those you don’t really need or want to be there. To add an icon, run the app you want to add, right-click its icon in the Launcher, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Lock to Launcher</strong></span>. To remove a Launcher icon, just right-click it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unlock from Launcher</strong></span>. As for emptying the Trash, since it’s in the neighborhood, let’s talk about it: Just right-click the Trash icon and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Empty Trash</strong></span>.</p><p>If you end up placing a lot of icons on the Launcher, or if you happen to have a lot of applications open at the same time, you will find that the icons at the bottom of the Launcher get scrunched, as in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_launcher_scrunches_up_your_icons_whe" title="Figure 3-8. The Launcher scrunches up your icons when things get too crowded.">Figure 3-8</a>. If you just move your mouse down to the bottom of the Launcher, however, the contents will start moving up, with each button unscrunching in turn. You can then click the Launcher icon you are looking for without any difficulty.

The Dash helps you find applications and files on your computer, and it can even help you find things on the Internet.

Otherwise, you can use your arrow keys to navigate to the target app and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span> to open it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0027"/></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Head-up Display"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="head-up_display"/>Head-up Display</h1></div></div></div><p>A feature similar to the Dash is Ubuntu’s new Head-up Display (HUD). The idea of a head-up display is to allow users to do what they need to do without having to take their eyes away from their area of focus—allowing them to keep their eye on the ball, so to speak. To that end, the HUD allows you to do many normally mouse-driven tasks by keyboard. Whatever application is in focus—whether it be the desktop, the file manager, Firefox, or the Terminal—pressing the <span class="keycap">alt</span> key will bring up a command box for that application at the top left of the screen. (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#bookmarking_a_page_in_firefox_via_the_hu" title="Figure 3-16. Bookmarking a page in Firefox via the HUD">Figure 3-16</a> shows an example using Firefox.) In that box, you can tell the application what you want to do, where you want to go, or what you are looking for by typing commands or keywords and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Basically, if it can be done in the application’s menus, it can also be done in the HUD.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0028"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="bookmarking_a_page_in_firefox_via_the_hu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2284"/><img alt="Bookmarking a page in Firefox via the HUD" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263466.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-16. Bookmarking a page in Firefox via the HUD</p></div><p>The HUD allows you to do all kinds of things you might not have imagined doing by keyboard. You can save a file, for example, by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>save</code></strong>, navigate from one folder to another in the file manager by typing the name of the folder you want to move to, or print a document by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>print</code></strong>. You can even play a song in Rhythmbox by typing the song’s name. The more you play around with HUD and try to use it, the easier and thus more useful it will become.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0030"/></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t have to learn key combinations or know the exact command in order to get things done. Just type in a word, and the HUD will work with you, showing you all the options it can think of that relate to what you’ve just typed. Pretty handy, I must say.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Navigating a Sea of Open Windows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="navigating_a_sea_of_open_windows"/>Navigating a Sea of Open Windows</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you get down to really using your system rather than just learning about it, there will likely be times when you have a few apps and a lot of windows open at the same time. When it’s only a couple of windows you want to arrange more neatly, you can just drag one window to either side of the screen, and it will then automatically resize itself to fit into that area. You can do the same for the other window, making it easy to work with both items side by side.</p><p>However, when you’re using several different applications and several different windows all at once, it can get confusing to figure out what’s running or even where a certain window is, buried among what seems like a hundred others. In this case, the Launcher can come in handy—it’s not only useful for starting up frequently used apps but also great for switching between applications or windows.</p><p>To help with this, the Launcher has a system of indicators that let you know what you’ve got open and running. When any Launcher item is running and its window is the one currently with <span class="emphasis"><em>focus</em></span> (meaning it is the application window currently in active use), a small arrow will appear to the right of the Launcher icon for that item (as you see for the home launcher in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru" title="Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple windows open.">Figure 3-17</a>). When the window for an open or running Launcher item is not focused, an arrow will appear to the left of its Launcher icon (as you see for the LibreOffice Writer icon in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru" title="Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple windows open.">Figure 3-17</a>). If more than one application window is open, with focus or not, white dash marks will appear to the left of the shortcut button instead of an arrow—two marks if two windows are open and three if three or more windows are open (also shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru" title="Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple windows open.">Figure 3-17</a>). Of course, if a Launcher item is not running or open, no marks will appear on either side of that Launcher icon.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0033"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2342"/><img alt="The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple windows open." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263468.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple windows open.</p></div><p>Switching between different running applications is easy enough to do by clicking the icons for the application you want to switch to. You can also do this from your keyboard by repeatedly pressing <span class="keycap">alt-tab</span> until you get to the application you want to use.</p><p>Yet another way to switch applications (or start an application that isn’t currently running) is to hold down the Windows key. After a second or so, the icons on the Launcher will become numbered, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#switching_between_applications_and_windo" title="Figure 3-18. Switching between applications and windows on the Launcher by numbers">Figure 3-18</a>. You can then switch to the application you want by pressing the number on your keyboard that corresponds to it. If more than one window of that application is open, the most recently used window will gain focus.</p><div class="figure"><a id="switching_between_applications_and_windo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2359"/><img alt="Switching between applications and windows on the Launcher by numbers" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263470.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-18. Switching between applications and windows on the Launcher by numbers</p></div><p>Even when you’ve gotten to the application you want, you might still not be in the right place—the window with focus may not be the one you want to deal with at that moment. For example, let’s say you have six file manager windows open and they’re all piled on top of one another. The one with focus is Documents, but you are looking for the one with your photos of your trip to Cyprus last summer. You could wade around with your mouse, dragging windows out of the way until you find the one you’re looking for.</p><p>A slightly easier way of going about this is to click any one of the open windows to give it focus, and then repeatedly press <span class="keycap">alt</span> and the key immediately above <span class="keycap">tab</span> (on most US keyboards, this is the key with the <span class="emphasis"><em>accent grave</em></span> and tilde symbols it) until you reach the window you want. Alternatively, you can find the window in a more direct manner by clicking the Launcher icon for your application (in this case the home button) once more, after which all the open windows related to the application for that Launcher icon will appear at once (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#seeing_all_the_open_windows_for_a_single" title="Figure 3-19. Seeing all the open windows for a single application via the Launcher">Figure 3-19</a>). You then just click the window you want to go to.</p><p>It is also possible to see all of the windows currently open, not just those for a particular application, at the same time. To do this, press the Windows and W keys. If you want to hide all of the windows so you can see the desktop itself, press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">alt</span>-D.</p><div class="figure"><a id="seeing_all_the_open_windows_for_a_single"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2391"/><img alt="Seeing all the open windows for a single application via the Launcher" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263472.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-19. Seeing all the open windows for a single application via the Launcher</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Workspace Switcher—Virtual Desktops"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="workspace_switchermvirtual_desktops"/>Workspace Switcher—Virtual Desktops</h1></div></div></div><p>Since we’re on the topic of navigating through desktop space, this is a good time to discuss <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual desktops</em></span>. Although the virtual desktop feature has only recently made its way into other operating systems, it has been a Linux feature for years (yes, it started here, folks). An easy way to think of virtual desktops is to think of your desktop as the top left quadrant of a four-times-bigger desktop. Most of the time you are using only that one piece of your total working space. But if you click the Workspace Switcher button on the Launcher (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#the_workplace_switcher_button_in_the_lau" title="Figure 3-20. The Workplace Switcher button in the Launcher">Figure 3-20</a>), you can see the rest of your desktop kingdom.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0035"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_workplace_switcher_button_in_the_lau"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2416"/><img alt="The Workplace Switcher button in the Launcher" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263474.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-20. The Workplace Switcher button in the Launcher</p></div><p>Although you can see here what I mean about your desktop being four times bigger than it seems, you have to see it in action to get a good feel for it. If you click the Workspace Switcher button again, you will be back to your original, familiar piece of desktop. Now open a few windows. For example, click the buttons for the Home folder, LibreOffice Writer, LibreOffice Calc, and System Settings (or whatever apps you prefer). Once you have an open window for each of them, start by dragging the System Settings window toward the bottom of the desktop until you can only see about half of it. Drag the LibreOffice Calc window to the right of the screen until you see only half of it and then drag the LibreOffice Writer window to the bottom-right corner of the screen until you can see only about one-quarter of it. When you click the Desktop Switcher button this time, your screen should look something like <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#viewing_your_virtual_desktops" title="Figure 3-21. Viewing your virtual desktops">Figure 3-21</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_your_virtual_desktops"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e2428"/><img alt="Viewing your virtual desktops" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263476.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-21. Viewing your virtual desktops</p></div><p>As you can see, your four virtual desktops look like one giant desktop, and you can move the windows to any quarter of that considerable area. Give it a try now. Drag those windows around until you have one window in each quarter of your desktop. Now, if you want to work with one of those windows, just double-click that portion of the screen. Your screen will now show only that portion of the desktop.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0037"/></p><p>Want to go to another window in another portion of the desktop? Click the Workplace Switcher button and then double-click the quadrant where the window is located. It is all really easy once you get the hang of it. It’s very handy too. You can separate your desktop into work areas, for example, with one part for writing a letter, another for all the budget items you are dealing with, and another for games when you need a little break.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Why Doesn’t My Desktop Look Like That?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_doesnat_my_desktop_look_like_that_qu"/>Why Doesn’t My Desktop Look Like That?</h1></div></div></div><p>If your desktop doesn’t look exactly like what you see in the screenshots in this chapter, it most likely means that Ubuntu automatically started you up in what is called <span class="emphasis"><em>fallback mode</em></span>. Fallback mode is an environment that is simpler in appearance and less demanding of video hardware. It is also referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>2D mode</em></span>. In case you’re wondering which mode you are in, the clearest giveaway is the Dash button. If the Dash button is a dark charcoal-gray with a white Ubuntu logo, then you are in 2D fallback mode. If it is a pleasant plum color with a white logo, then you are in the standard 3D mode.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-3-0039"/></p><p>Ubuntu defaults to fallback mode when your hardware, particularly your video card, does not have what Ubuntu needs in order to run Unity, which is fairly demanding of graphics hardware. Possibly your card is too old or too new or just too underpowered, or the drivers your system needs to use the card to its full potential may not be installed. You can check if drivers are available for your machine by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>System Settings</strong></span> button in the Launcher. When the System Settings window appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Additional Drivers</strong></span>. The Additional Drivers window (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#installing_video_drivers" title="Figure 3-22. Installing video drivers">Figure 3-22</a>) will appear and let you know if there are any drivers available for you to install.

Keyboard shortcuts are not unique to Ubuntu, but many will be different from those you know in your current operating system. Fortunately, it’s easy to see a list of the Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Just press and hold down the Windows key. In addition to making numbers appear over the icons in the Launcher, this will show a chart that lists all of Unity’s keyboard shortcuts (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#viewing_a_list_of_ubuntu_keyboard_shortc" title="Figure 3-23. Viewing a list of Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts">Figure 3-23</a>).

In the menu that appears, there will be a number of choices in the lower half to choose from: Lock Screen, Log Out, Suspend, and Shut Down.

You will know whether this is so in your case because all screen activity will come to an end. If you get to that point and nothing else happens for 15 seconds or so, then just power down the machine manually by pressing the power button. It is completely safe to do so at that point.</p></div></div></body></html>
