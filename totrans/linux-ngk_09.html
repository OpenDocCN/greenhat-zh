<i class="calibre11">Getting to Know the Linux Terminal and Command Line</i>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Many people shy away from Linux because  they envision it as a system for compu-geeks:  an environment in which you do everything  the hard way by command line. In this era of graphical interfaces, the idea of typing commands to get things done seems a dreadful throwback to the days of DOS, and that puts many people off —  especially those who remember what it was like in those  “old days.” </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This reaction is fair enough, but it is not really an accurate reflection of the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some sort of graphical  interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they hope to achieve through drop- down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many are able to survive quite happily without  ever once opening their Terminal. The same could be true of you.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Be that as it may, there is still much to be said for the power and convenience of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be utilized  within a graphical environment provided by the Terminal application also makes  it much less forbidding. The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of  graphical bodies (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU92">Figure 9-1</a>). Using the command line can be as harmless as  anything else you do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a little  fun if you are willing to give it a try.</p>

<span><span>Figure 9-1: </span> Putting the Terminal in perspective</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Unfortunately, many guides to using the command line are written by hard-core  command-line junkies, whose enthusiasm for what they see as a really good thing  inadvertently makes what they write seem even more off-putting than it already  seems to the recent Linux immigrant or wannabe. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">For your sake, I will try to curb my own enthusiasm so as not to scare you  right back to <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a> and the seemingly safe world of RPMs. I will also try to  help you keep things in perspective by teaching you, whenever possible, to use  the command line as a complement to the various graphical tools that you have  at your disposal, rather than presenting it as the sole way of going about things.  Of course, I am not going to cover every possible angle in this regard — just  enough to give you some exposure and experience and, hopefully, make you feel  at least a little more at ease with the command line. Who knows; you might actually come to think of using the command line as . . . fun? Well, I won’t get too carried away.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Linux Command Terminal application in your Fedora system can be run by  going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">System Tools </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Terminal</b>. However, you should have already added a launcher for the Terminal to your GNOME Panel in  <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>, so you might as well click that instead. When the Terminal opens, it  will, in all its simplicity, look much like <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU93">Figure 9-2</a>.<a name="377" id="377"/><a name="IDX-122" id="IDX-122"/>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 9-2: </span> The Terminal application</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see, all it says is <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:rg@localhost">rg@localhost</a> rg]$</span></b>. In this case, the first <b class="calibre13"><span>rg</span></b> is my  username, <b class="calibre13"><span>localhost</span></b> is the default name of my computer, and the second <b class="calibre13"><span>rg</span></b> is the  directory I am currently in, my user’s Home directory, which is the default  location of the Terminal application. In your case, the username and default  directory will all be different. If your username is frog, for example, the  command line will say <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:frog@localhost">frog@localhost</a> frog]$</span></b><span>.</span> If all this is sounding rather obtuse  to you, just think of it this way: <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a> username]$</span></b> in the Command  Terminal is the equivalent of your user’s Home folder in Nautilus.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Typing in the Terminal is straightforward enough; you just type as you usually do. You can also delete and insert letters or phrases by using the DELETE and  BACKSPACE keys and the cursor keys. For practice, try the following:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type: <span>I like strawberries so very much.</span>
</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, change <span>strawberries</span> to <span>cherries</span> (because cherries are, in fact, so much  better). Just use your left cursor key to move the cursor in front of the first <i class="calibre11">s </i>in <span>strawberries</span>. </p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Next, tap on your DELETE key as many times as necessary to erase the word </p>
<pre class="programlisting">strawberries (uh, that would be 12 times, methinks).</pre>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, just type <span>cherry</span> and then use your right cursor key to move the cursor  back to the end of this meaningful sentence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you’ve completed this fascinating bit of typing practice, press the ENTER key. As you will almost immediately see, the Terminal’s response to your efforts  thus far is merely a dismissive: <b class="calibre13"><span>bash: I: command not found</span></b>. Although you’ve typed a  string of text that has meaning to you, it means absolutely nothing to your  system. In fact, the system was so shortsighted that it could see nothing other  than the first word you typed in the Terminal (<span>I</span>); and because <i class="calibre11">I</i> is not a valid  command, the system had no idea what do to with it. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you now know, all of this typing is easy enough, but in order to actually do  something useful with your Terminal, you need to type commands, and there are  more of them than you could ever hope or need to know. To get you started, we  will begin with some commands that are easy to understand, nontoxic, and  completely child-friendly.<a name="381" id="381"/><a name="IDX-123" id="IDX-123"/>
</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There is no command as easy, safe, and even as seemingly useless, as <b class="calibre13">whoami</b>.  Rather than help those with multiple-personality disorders discover who they are  at any given moment, the <b class="calibre13">whoami</b> command simply tells you what user is currently logged in. Try it out by typing <span>whoami</span> after the <b class="calibre13"><span>$</span></b> and then pressing the ENTER key. Remember that commands are case sensitive, so type accordingly. The Terminal will now tell you the username of the person currently logged in. If  you are logged in as frog, you should get <b class="calibre13"><span>frog</span></b> as the answer to your command.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre10">
<h3 class="sect3-title">

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you essentially know who you are but aren’t exactly sure where you are, the  <b class="calibre13">pwd</b> command (print working directory) should come in handy. The <b class="calibre13">pwd </b>command tells you exactly where the Terminal is in your directory tree. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s say, for example, that my Terminal is in my rg Home directory when I use the <b class="calibre13">pwd</b> command; I would, after pressing the ENTER key, get<b class="calibre13"><span> /home/rg</span></b> printed  to my Terminal. You should get similar results if you try it out.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another safe and easy, but much more useful, command is<b class="calibre13"> df</b><span> (disk filesystem)</span>.  The <b class="calibre13">df</b> command tells you how much disk space you have used, as well as how  much space you still have available, on each of the partitions on your various mounted disks. Try it out by typing <span>df</span> and then pressing ENTER. Your output  should look something like that shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU94">Figure 9-3</a> (depending, of course, on  the size of your mounted disks and how they are set up).</p>
<div class="calibre10">

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 9-3: </span> Output from the df command </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you will notice, the sizes are given in kilobytes (KB) rather than the GB  (gigabytes) and MB (megabytes) you are probably more used to, but there is a  way around this. Many commands accept a <i class="calibre11">flag</i>, or <i class="calibre11">option</i>, to further instruct the  command how to perform. These flags are written directly after the main  command and are preceded by a space and a hyphen. <a name="387" id="387"/><a name="IDX-124" id="IDX-124"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In this case, you can try using the <b class="calibre13">-h</b> (human readable) flag to have your figures come out in the way you are most familiar with. Try this out by typing <span>df -h </span>on the command line and pressing ENTER. The output should now appear in a  more familiar format (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU95">Figure 9-4</a>).</p>
<div class="calibre10">

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another harmless but handy command is <b class="calibre13">ls</b> (list directory contents). The <b class="calibre13">ls </b>command shows you what is in your current directory. This is the non-graphical  equivalent of double-clicking a folder in Nautilus to see what is inside. Try it out  by typing <span>ls</span> and then pressing the ENTER key. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you’ve been following<i class="calibre11"> my</i> commands so far, your results should list all of  the folders in your Home directory. You can also use the <b class="calibre13">-R</b> flag to show not only the list of files in the folder, but also what is within the subfolders. Of course, you  should have no subfolders in any of the folders you created in <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>, so you  can hold off experimenting with this for a while. Instead, try typing <span>ls -a</span> to see  your <i class="calibre11">invisible</i>, or <i class="calibre11">hidden</i>, files. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you have to change from being a normal user to being the root user, there  are two simple and straightforward steps involved. Open a new Terminal window  by clicking the Terminal launcher in your Panel, and then type <span>su</span> and press ENTER; you will be asked for your root password. As you type your password, the  password itself will not appear in the Terminal, but that is how things are  supposed to be, so don’t panic. When you are done, press the ENTER key and the  prompt you usually see in your Terminal, <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a> username]$</span></b>, will be  replaced by your root prompt: <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</a> username]#</span></b>. Notice that instead of a <b class="calibre13"><span>$</span></b> at the end of the prompt, you now have a <b class="calibre13"><span>#</span></b> instead, which indicates that you are  in root mode. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see, you are now root, but you are still in your Home folder. If  you change to root while in a different folder, such as <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a> multimedia]$</span></b>, the prompt will similarly be in a different folder: <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</a> multimedia]#</span></b>.<a name="391" id="391"/><a name="IDX-125" id="IDX-125"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can get out of root and back to your normal user mode by using the <b class="calibre13">exit </b>command. Just type <span>exit</span> and press ENTER and you will become your old self in  user mode again. Very simple and handy. If you use the <b class="calibre13">exit</b> command while in  user mode, you will exit the Terminal window.</p>

<a name="393" class="calibre15" id="393"/><a name="wbp11Chapter9P39" class="calibre15" id="wbp11Chapter9P39"/><i class="emphasis">$ locate</i>
</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In contrast to the seemingly lightweight commands you have learned so far, the  <b class="calibre13">locate</b> command is really quite useful. In fact, you might well find it a much  easier, faster, and more effective method of finding files than the graphical  search tool in the Main menu. Using the command is quite easy: You simply type  the command followed by a space and the name of the file you are searching for.  You can use this command in either root or user mode.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before you can use this command, though, you will need to create a database  of filenames for <b class="calibre13">locate</b> to use. This is quite easily done by becoming root using  the <b class="calibre13">su</b> command, which you just learned in the <a role="targetype:section" href="#wbp11Chapter9P37">previous section</a>, and then typing  in <span>updatedb</span> (Whoa, Nellie! Yet another command!), followed by a tap on the ENTER key. It will seem that nothing is happening for a while, but don’t worry. As long as the cursor in your Terminal is blinking, progress is being made, and  when your root prompt returns, you will have successfully created the database  file. After that, you can go on and use the <b class="calibre13">locate</b> command.</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To take this new command out for a test-drive, let’s look for the <b class="calibre13">kolf.png</b> file  that we searched for via the graphical search tool in <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You have already learned how to create folders by means of menus and your  mouse, but you can also do this using the command line. The command is <b class="calibre13">mkdir </b>(make directory), and it is easy as punch to use (though I’ve never been quite  sure how punch is easy). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To see how this command works, and to work with the commands that follow, use the <b class="calibre13">mkdir</b> command now to create a folder called <b class="calibre13">command_exp</b> (for  command experiments). All you have to do is type <span>mkdir command_exp</span> and then  press ENTER. The new folder should appear in your Home folder, so go ahead  and check to see if it is there by clicking the user’s Home icon on your desktop.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">OK, good, <i class="calibre11">bra</i>, <i class="calibre11">bueno! </i>Now let’s create another new folder within that new  folder — a <i class="calibre11">subfolder</i>, if you will.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The next command is the <b class="calibre13">mv</b> (move) command, but before we experiment with  it, we need to create a dummy file — we need something to move, after all. Go to  the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Text Editor</b>. This will bring up the text  editor program called Gedit. All you are going to do with Gedit is click the <b class="calibre13">Save </b>button; you don’t have to write anything in the document itself. A <b class="calibre13">Save As  </b>window should then appear, and in the box near the bottom of that window (just  under the words <b class="calibre13">Selection: /home/username</b>), type <span>expfile</span> and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.  The new file, named expfile, should appear in your Home directory.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To move the file that you’ve just created, you will use the <b class="calibre13">mv</b> command, of  course. Just type <span>mv expfile command_exp/sub</span> (this tells the system which file to move and where to move it to) and then press ENTER. The file will now be in your  sub folder.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Until now, you have been using the command line from your Home folder. With  the <b class="calibre13">cd</b> command, you can change your Terminal’s location to another folder. This is a very handy command that you will be using quite a lot when doing the  other projects in this book. To take it out for a spin, let’s get inside the  <b class="calibre13">command_exp </b>folder by typing <span>cd command_exp</span> and pressing ENTER. If you’ve done  this correctly, the prompt in your Terminal should now read <b class="calibre13"><span>[<a target="_top" href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a> command_exp]</span></b>. If so, you can pat yourself on the back.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While you are there, you might as well try out the <b class="calibre13">ls</b> command with<b class="calibre13"> -R</b> flag to  see how that works. Just type in <span>ls -R</span> and press ENTER. Your Terminal should now show that you have a subfolder there called <b class="calibre13">sub</b> and a file inside that subfolder  called <b class="calibre13">expfile</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">That is all you really want to do in there for now, so to get back to your  Home directory, just type <span>cd</span> and press ENTER, which will take you back home, so  to speak.<a name="400" id="400"/><a name="IDX-127" id="IDX-127"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Being fickle, as humans by nature are, you have now decided that you not only  want your <b class="calibre13">expfile</b> in the <b class="calibre13">sub </b>folder, but that you also want a copy in your Home  directory, where it was in the first place. To copy <b class="calibre13">expfile</b>, you can use the <b class="calibre13">cp</b>(copy) command. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To do this, the command needs to know where the file you want to copy is,  what it is called, and where you want to copy it to. In this case, type the following command (replacing <i class="calibre11">username </i>with your actual username) and then press ENTER:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">cp command_exp/sub/expfile /home/username </pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Be sure to put a space between the file you are copying and its destination (in  this case, between the <span>expfile</span> and <span>/home/username</span>). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve done this, you should have two copies of <b class="calibre13">expfile</b>, one in your  Home folder and one in your <b class="calibre13">sub </b>folder. Go have a look to see the fruit of your  endeavors.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you were a kid, you may well have experienced the joy of building a castle  out of LEGO bricks and then the even greater joy of tearing the whole thing  down (preferably with D-cell batteries). We will now embark on a similar move.  The first tool in this nostalgic endeavor is the <b class="calibre13">rm</b> (remove) command, with which  we can trash files. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The <b class="calibre13">rm</b> command, albeit very useful and easy to use, should be used with  caution. Once you remove a file with this command, there is no going back — the file is gone for good. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To play it safe, let’s try out the<b class="calibre13"> rm</b> command by getting rid of that new copy  of <b class="calibre13">expfile</b> that we just created in your Home folder. The basic<b class="calibre13"> rm</b> command  structure consists of the command itself, <b class="calibre13">rm</b>, followed by the name of the file that  you wish to remove. In this case, you want to remove the file called <b class="calibre13">expfile </b>located in your Home folder. Assuming your Command Terminal shows you to  be Home, you can remove the file by typing<span> rm expfile</span> followed by a tap on the  ol’ ENTER key. The file will then be gone, and gone for good.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, double your pleasure by getting rid of the version of <b class="calibre13">expfile</b> that is  located in the subfolder <b class="calibre13">sub</b>. In this case, you need to specify where the file is  because it isn’t in the folder that the Terminal is in. Just type <span>rm command_exp/sub/</span>expfile and then press ENTER. Oooh, very cool. Brings ya back, doesn’t it?</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>, you learned how to change file permissions via the Nautilus  interface. This is without a doubt the easiest way to go about such things, but  when you have a folder full of files, perhaps copied to your hard disk from CD,  that are emblazoned with the <i class="calibre11">verboten</i> symbol, it can prove quite tiring to change  the permissions of such files one by one. In this case, the command-line  approach proves to be much easier to deal with.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The command for changing file permissions is<b class="calibre13"> chmod</b> (change mode). To  use it, just type the command followed by the permissions you want to extend to  a file, and then the location of the file itself. For example, let’s say that you copied a JPEG file called mybirthday.jpg from CD to the personal subfolder within  the Photos folder on your hard disk, and the file is write protected. To change  the file so that you have write permissions (meaning that you can alter the file),  you would type in the following and then press ENTER: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">chmod 744 photos/personal/mybirthday.jpg </pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To change the permissions of all the files and subfolders (and all the files within  those subfolders) in one fell swoop, you can add the <b class="calibre13">-R </b>(recursive) flag to the  <b class="calibre13">chmod</b> command. The command would thus be as follows: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">chmod -R 744 photos/personal</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The number 744, by the way, extends read, write, and execute permissions to  you, the owner, but gives read-only rights to everyone else — a pretty safe choice  when in doubt. If you want to figure out permission numbers for yourself, it is  pretty easy. You are basically dealing with three number positions, each of which  has eight numerical possibilities (0–7). The left slot represents permissions for  the owner; the center slot represents the permissions for the group; and the third  slot represents permissions for others. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The meanings of the numbers themselves are as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">7 = Read, write, and execute permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">6 = Read and write permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">5 = Read and execute permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">4 = Read-only permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">3 = Write and execute permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">2 = Write-only permissions</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">1 = Execute-only permissions</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is as good a place as any to introduce yet two more commands that you will  be called upon to use in this chapter and elsewhere in the book: <b class="calibre13">rpm</b> and <b class="calibre13">ln</b>. You  needn’t practice with these yet, as you will be using them very soon, but you  might as well know what they are all about.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The <b class="calibre13">ln</b> (link) command is used to create a link file that launches or activates  another file located in a separate folder. This is very useful when trying to  activate a file that is buried deep in the subfolder of a subfolder of a subfolder  somewhere on your hard disk. The command is very often used with the <b class="calibre13">-s</b>(symbolic) flag, which provides essentially the same thing as the “shortcut”  you’ve come to know in Windows, or the “alias” on the Mac.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The easiest way to use the <b class="calibre13">ln</b> command is to first use the <b class="calibre13">cd</b> command to  change the Terminal’s location to the folder where you want to place the link.  Then you can type the <i class="calibre11">ln</i> command on the command line, followed by the path of the file you wish to link to. For example, let’s say that you wanted to put a link  in your Home folder for an OpenOffice.org Writer file of the autobiography  you’ve been writing, called <b class="calibre13">myLife.sxw</b>. The file is pretty well buried in a nest of  subfolders deep within your user’s Home folder: /home/username/Documentia/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.sxw. To create the link, you would  open a new Terminal window, type in the following command string, and then  press ENTER:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">ln -s Documentia/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.sxw</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you are finished, the link will appear in your Home folder as an icon  matching the original file in terms of appearances, albeit sporting a green arrow  to signify that it is a link.<a name="410" id="410"/><a name="IDX-130" id="IDX-130"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you might have guessed on your own, the <b class="calibre13">rpm</b> command is used to install  RPM files. Of course, you can do this through simple mouse clicks alone, but  sometimes the command-line alternative can be quite useful. As the <b class="calibre13">rpm </b>command usually requires the system to write to files that can only be written to  by root, you must first become root in order to use it for installation. That is why  there is a # sign before the command in the heading.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As with most commands, <b class="calibre13">rpm </b>can be used in conjunction with flags. In fact,  the most commonly used command and flag combination for this command is  <b class="calibre13">rpm -Uvh</b>. There are actually three flags used together in this case: <b class="calibre13">U</b>, <b class="calibre13">v</b>, and <b class="calibre13">h</b>.  When using more than one flag simultaneously, the flags are written together  after the hyphen (<b class="calibre13">-Uvh</b>, not <b class="calibre13">-U -v -h</b>).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The <b class="calibre13">U</b> (update) flag either installs a file anew or updates a previously  installed version of the same file, depending on whether or not a version of the  file exists on the system. Thus, if you are trying to install a file called <b class="calibre13">dog-1.0.2</b>,  and your system already has a file called <b class="calibre13">dog-1.0.1</b>, the <b class="calibre13">U</b> flag tells the<b class="calibre13"> rpm</b> command to update that file. If there is no such <b class="calibre13">dog</b> file on your system, the <b class="calibre13">U</b> flag  merely tells the <b class="calibre13">rpm</b> command to install it. The second flag, <b class="calibre13">v </b>(verbose), tells the  <b class="calibre13">rpm</b> command to give you a progress report of what is going on. The last flag,<b class="calibre13"> h</b>(hash), tells the command to use hash marks (###) as the means by which to  indicate that progress — a sort of Terminal version of the progress bar.</p>

The oracle will then tell you what it has to say. As an example, I  asked the oracle if I am going to be rich, picked <i class="calibre11">self</i> as my concern and <i class="calibre11">truth</i> as  the realm. <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU99">Figure 9-8</a> shows the wisdom that was bestowed upon me.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">pyWings is written in a programming language called Python, which actually  creates scripts rather than true conventional programs. You will find out a little  more about this distinction in <a href="DDU0084_split_000.html#488" target="_parent">Chapter 11</a>. For now, one of the differences I can  mention right off the bat is that you don’t actually have to install pyWings; you  are simply going to put it on your hard drive in your Home folder and run it  from there, more or less as is. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">OK, so now you are just about ready to begin installing pyWings, but before you  do, you must get the files you need. First of all, you will need pyWings itself, which you can get from the project’s home page at <a target="_top" href="http://pywings.sourceforge">http://pywings.sourceforge.</a>  net/download.html. Just scroll down the page to the section that says <b class="calibre13">Unix/ Linux/X11</b> and click the <b class="calibre13">HTTP </b>link, which will get you the file <b class="calibre13">pywings-1.0.1.tar.gz</b> (the .tar.gz ending tells you that this is a <i class="calibre11">tarball </i>— the Linux world’s  answer to ZIP files).

</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">PyWings requires that you have <b class="calibre13">tkinter</b>, one of the several graphical interface  packages for Python scripts, installed on your system, and tkinter has three  dependencies of its own that you must also install in order for it to work — this is  your first real experience with dependency hell. Fortunately, this isn’t all that  hellish an endeavor, as all four files are available on your installation disks. Of  course, you can simply copy these files to your hard disk via the familiar drag-and- drop method, but because you are learning about the command line, let’s do it  via the Terminal.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned before, you will be installing the pyWings program locally in your  Home folder. Installing a program <i class="calibre11">locally</i> means that you are installing the  program and all its support and data files in your own Home folder.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The method of running pyWings that you’ve just used works well enough, but it  is a pain in the posterior to open your Terminal and type that somewhat lengthy  string every time you want to find out what fate has in store for you. Let’s find a  way to make things easier in the future. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To run an application from the Terminal, you generally type the name of  that application, or, to put it more precisely, the name of that program’s executable file; the application’s name thus acts as a sort of command. In order for your  system to recognize that command, however, the command (the executable file,  or a link to it) must be in a location where the system can find it. Whenever you  run a command of any sort, your system checks a series of locations (all of which are <b class="calibre13">bin </b>folders, where executable files are located) to find that command. <a name="435" id="435"/><a name="IDX-138" id="IDX-138"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can easily find out where these locations are by typing <span>echo $PATH</span> in a  new Terminal window and then pressing ENTER. As you will see, on your Fedora  or Red Hat Linux system, these locations are:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">/usr/local/bin</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">/usr/bin</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">/bin</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">/usr/X11R6/bin</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">home/username/bin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">(The last of these folders you create yourself if and when you need it.) If the  command you typed is in one of those locations, the program, or script, will run. As you no doubt know, however, pyWings is not in any of those locations. It is in  /home/username/LocalApps/pyWings and is thus, in a sense, out of your  system’s sight.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To remedy this situation, you could add the path of your pyWings script to  the list of paths that the system checks for <span>run</span> commands, so as to make the system aware of your new application’s existence. However, you will have the same  problem later on in this book, and perhaps in your longer life as a Linux user.  Instead, let’s try another method that I think is easier. What you will do is create  a link, a sort of launchable alias, in one of the locations your system does check  for commands. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To create this link, you will be using three commands:<b class="calibre13"> cd</b> (to change directories), <b class="calibre13">su</b> (to become root), and <b class="calibre13">ln -s </b>(to create the link). </p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the Terminal, type <span>cd /usr/local/bin</span> and press ENTER. This puts you in one  of the searchable bin folders.</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>su</span> and press ENTER. You will then be prompted for your root password,  so type it and then press ENTER again.</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>ln -s /home/username/LocalApps/pyWings/pywings.py pywings</span> and press  ENTER. (Note that there is a space between the words <span>pywings.py</span> and <span>pywings </span>at the end of that command string.) The <span>pywings</span> at the end of that command  string is the name that you are giving the link; the name of the link thus  becomes the command you will use to run the application. If you type  nothing, the link will be called pywings.py, which would mean three more  keystrokes for you every time you wanted to start the program.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have created the link, you should be able to run the pyWings  program much more easily. Let’s try it out. </p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You’ve managed to cut down on the number of keystrokes required to run  pyWings from the Terminal. However, if you are really into this pyWings thing  and want to use it often, it will probably be handiest to add a launcher to your  Panel or drawer, as you learned to do in <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>.

The concept is essentially  the same as pyWings, but it is based on the Chinese Taoist <i class="calibre11">I Ching</i>, so it is a bit  more cultural and educational. pyChing is, to be sure, equally fun and ultimately  as useless as pyWings, though it is perhaps a bit cooler and more cryptic in its advice.</p>

You can also do the same to the <b class="calibre13">install_flash_player_6_linux.tar.gz</b> tarball, though I would  back up the tarball to CD first, just in case you need to do this all again someday.</p>
