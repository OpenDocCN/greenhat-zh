<i class="calibre11">Music à la Linux</i>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It’s now time to move on to the audio side  of things. Yes, Linux does indeed rock. You  already learned about the GNOME CD  Player in <a href="DDU0055_split_000.html#309" target="_parent">Chapter 7</a>, but in this chapter you  will find out even more about your system’s  musical talents. You will learn how to rip CDs and create MP3 and Ogg files (which have the .mp3 and .ogg  filename extensions), how to change the tags of such files,  and how to play those files. You’ll also learn how to play a  variety of audio streams. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before we go any further, it is probably best to discuss the various formats in which  audio data can be stored on your computer. The de facto standards for the longest  time have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the .wav extension), AU</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">(from Sun/Unix, and using the .au extension), and AIFF (from Apple), all of  which are uncompressed formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore,  exceedingly large, with an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at  about 10MB per minute. To put that in perspective, my first Macintosh back in  1988 had a 40MB hard disk — more space than I would ever need, I thought at  the time, but not enough to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s “Come as You Are.”</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they  are today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about  those disk-space devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus  developed. These compression formats worked, to oversimplify things a bit, by  cutting out the portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear — sort  of a dog-whistle approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio  compression formats is MP3. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up  being as little as one-twelfth the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another audio-compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. Ogg  Vorbis was a product of the open source community, and so, unlike MP3, which  has always been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, was  free of patent and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of that, and the fact  that it was the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not better),  Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the Linux community, and its de facto audio  compression format. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the handiest and most popular multimedia programs on your system is  Grip. Grip allows you to <i class="calibre11">rip</i> (copy) WAV files from audio CDs and save those files  as is, or <i class="calibre11">encode</i> them as (convert them to) compressed Ogg or MP3 files for your  own personal use, on either your computer or an external device, such as Apple’s  iPod (though iPod cannot as of yet play Ogg files; not that many players can).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The process for ripping a CD and saving the tracks as WAV files, or of rip- ping the CD and then encoding its files in the Ogg file format is quite simple.  Grip, as configured in Fedora, is already set up to do it quite well. To start, just  place the audio CD you want to rip in your drive. The GNOME CD Player will  then automatically start, but you don’t need it for this ripping endeavor, so you  can close it. Then, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Sound </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Video </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More Sound  </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Video Applications </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Grip</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Grip will open, and after a couple of seconds it will display the contents of  the CD in your drive. Assuming you are connected to the Internet when doing  this, Grip will also list the title of the album, the artist who recorded it, and the  titles of all of the songs on the CD (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU121">Figure 13-1</a>). <a name="553" id="553"/><a name="IDX-172" id="IDX-172"/>

<span><span>Figure 13-1: </span> Grip displaying CD information retrieved from the Internet</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the songs are displayed in the Grip window, you can select the songs you  want to rip by clicking next to the titles under the <b class="calibre13">Rip</b> column. Or if you want to  rip them all, you can just click the heading <b class="calibre13">Rip</b> at the top of that column. After  you have made your selections, click the <b class="calibre13">Rip</b> tab to display the Rip page (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU122">Figure 13-2</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you just want to rip the tracks and save them as WAV files (which take up a lot  of disk space), you can click the <b class="calibre13">Rip Only</b> button, and the ripping process will  begin. If you want to rip the files and encode them in the much smaller Ogg  format for playback on your own computer, click <b class="calibre13">Rip + Encode</b>, and Grip will  begin to rip and then encode the files simultaneously. The encoding process will  take longer than the ripping. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once Grip has done its work and has ejected your CD, you will find your new  files on your hard disk in the <b class="calibre13">ogg</b> folder inside your user’s Home folder. If you  didn’t create an ogg folder when doing the projects in <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>, Grip will have  automatically created one for you. If you clicked the <b class="calibre13">Rip + Encode</b> button to  encode your files in the Ogg format, Grip will also have deleted the space-wasting  WAV files that it ripped from the CD. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A folder for the artist will have been created inside your <b class="calibre13">ogg</b> folder, there will  be a folder for the album inside the newly created artist folder, and the ripped (and possibly encoded) files will be within the album folder. Thus, if you ripped  a CD called <i class="calibre11">Orange Lightning Water</i> by Chuck Rumsfoord and the Venutians, you  would find your files in ogg/chuck_rumsfoord_and_the_venutians/orange_ lightning_water. Grip will also create an M3U playlist for the album outside of  the artist folder (with an .m3u filename extension). Double-clicking that file will  start up your default audio player, which will load the entire song list for that  album and then start playing it all. Very handy.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Although I, as well as most Linux users, prefer the Ogg Vorbis format to that of  MP3, there are many who need or want to encode files as MP3s. This is particularly true if you have an iPod-like player that cannot support Ogg files as of yet. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fedora does not come with any native MP3 support, and the Grip application cannot encode MP3 files without such support. Without knowing it, however, you already provided Grip with the capacity to do this when you installed  MPlayer in <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a> using APT/Synaptic. One of the dependencies for  MPlayer that APT/Synaptic downloaded and installed on your system was a  program called LAME, which is an MP3 encoding program. This being the case,  you are all ready to go. (I told you that those dependencies would come in  handy later.) </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="562" id="562"/><a name="IDX-175" id="IDX-175"/>Fedora Core includes an alternative CD ripper called Sound Juicer. Sound  Juicer is a rather new program that is not as well known as Grip, but it is much  easier to use. On the downside, it doesn’t automatically create a playlist for the  songs you rip and encode, and it seems (at least to me) to be a bit slower and, at  times, a bit quirky. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To give it a try, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Sound </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Video </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More  Sound </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Video Applications </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Sound Juicer CD Ripper</b>. After you place an audio CD in the drive, the title of the album, name of the artist, and a list of the tracks  on that CD will appear in the program window if, of course, you are connected to the Internet at the time (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU124">Figure 13-4</a> on the next page).</p>

<span><span>Figure 13-4: </span> Sound Juicer displaying CD information</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Sound Juicer is set up by default to rip your CDs and encode the audio files  in Ogg Vorbis format. The default location in which Sound Juicer will save these  files is your Home folder. Because you have an ogg folder for this purpose  already, it is probably best to make this the default location for Sound Juicer as  well. To do so, go to the<b class="calibre13"> Edit</b> menu and select <b class="calibre13">Preferences</b>. This will open the  Preferences window where you can change the output path by clicking the  <b class="calibre13">Browse</b> button (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU125">Figure 13-5</a> on <a href="DDU0095.html#568" target="_parent">page 177</a>). In the Select Output Location window, double-click the<b class="calibre13"> ogg</b> folder in the Folders pane of that window and then  click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.

<span><span>Figure 13-5: </span> Setting the default location for Sound Juicer audio files</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may well have noticed that in the Preferences window there are also settings  for file formats other than Ogg Vorbis. Though the preference settings are there,  the support files required to use them are not included in your Fedora Core  system. If you have your heart set on encoding MP3s, you can use Grip for now,  or you can check out the APT repositories with Synaptic. You can also check my  Web site to see if there is any updated information on this score (<a target="_top" href="http://www.edgypenguins.org/LFYM">www.edgypenguins.org/LFYM</a>).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To start ripping all the songs, all you need to do is click the <b class="calibre13">Extract</b> button at  the bottom of the Sound Juicer window. If there are certain tracks you do not  care to rip and encode, just uncheck the checkboxes next to the names of the  songs in question before you click <b class="calibre13">Extract</b>. If you only want to rip and encode a  few of the songs in the list, it might be better to first go to the <b class="calibre13">Edit</b> menu, select  <b class="calibre13">Deselect All</b>, and then check the checkboxes next to the songs you do want to rip  before clicking <b class="calibre13">Extract</b>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As the songs are being ripped and encoded, Sound Juicer will show you its  progress in a progress window, and when it’s all done, it will also tell you in a  small window that the tracks have been copied successfully. Once you get that  message, click <b class="calibre13">Close</b> (the still-buggy Open button does the same thing). You can  then eject the CD by going to the <b class="calibre13">File</b> menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Eject</b>. If you want to  rip and encode another CD, just pop it into the drive, and then, just as with the  first CD, the album, artist, and titles will all appear in the program window, and  you can rip away yet again.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A new addition to Fedora Core is an audio player called Rhythmbox (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU126">Figure 13-6</a>), and it is now the default audio player in Fedora Core for Ogg files. Rhythmbox, using Sound Juicer as its ripper/encoder, is supposed to function  pretty much like the Macintosh world’s iTunes application.</p>

<a name="568" id="568"/><a name="IDX-177" id="IDX-177"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Unfortunately, the Rhythmbox music player seems to have been introduced into  Fedora Core before its time, as it is still sort of buggy in certain areas. I can’t  really recommend it, especially when the tried and true XMMS audio player (which I will get to shortly) is also installed on your system. I will wait for a couple  more Rhythmbox upgrades (which will eventually be available via APT) before  making it my default audio player.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you still want to give Rhythmbox a look, by all means do, but just remember that you cannot play MP3 files (at least, not for the time being), and support  for Ogg-format Internet radio streams is quirky at best. This really only leaves you  with the ability to play the Ogg files on your disks, which Rhythmbox handles  quite nicely. Because Rhythmbox is now the default audio player in Fedora Core  for Ogg files, all you need to do is double-click on any Ogg file to run it. Alternatively, you can go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Sound and Video </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Music Player</b>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The first time you run Rhythmbox, you will be greeted by a three-step setup  wizard. To get through the first introduction screen, just click <b class="calibre13">Forward</b>. In the  second screen (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU127">Figure 13-7</a>), you should tell Rhythmbox where it is you  keep (or plan to keep) your Ogg files. As you should already have created an ogg  folder while following along with this book, use that folder. In the <b class="calibre13">Path</b> input box  type <span>/home/username/ogg</span> (or use the <b class="calibre13">Browse</b> button to locate the folder graphically), and then click <b class="calibre13">Forward</b>. Finally, in the third and final screen, just click  <b class="calibre13">Apply</b>, and Rhythmbox will scan your ogg folder and add any songs it finds there  to its library. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are familiar with Apple’s iTunes, then you should pretty well understand  the library in Rhythmbox too, as it is essentially the same concept. Basically, every  time you tell Rhythmbox to check your ogg folder for new songs (by going to the  <b class="calibre13">File</b> menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Add to Library</b>), it scans that folder and adds any new  songs it finds to its library. You can also add other single audio files, or folders  containing such files, by right-clicking the target file or folder and selecting <b class="calibre13">Add  to Music Player Library</b> in the pop-up menu. The library is thus, in essence, a  database of all the songs you have in your ogg folder and any others that you  point Rhythmbox to.<a name="571" id="571"/><a name="IDX-178" id="IDX-178"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you want to play songs in Rhythmbox, you just need to click<b class="calibre13"> Library </b>in the Source pane on the left side of the program window. This will show all of  the songs that you have listed in your library. You can click the play button to  start playing them all, or scroll down to a song you want to start with and double- click that.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, as your library grows, this can all become rather problematic —  there might be a day when you are feeling a bit more Roxy Music than Britney  (and thank goodness for that). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fortunately Rhythmbox has a nice browser function that allows you to see  lists of the artists and albums listed in its library. If you click a specific artist in  the Artist pane, a list of albums by that artist will appear in the right pane (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU128">Figure 13-8</a>). You can then double-click one of the albums in that right pane to  play it. If you want to play all of the albums you have by that artist, just double- click the artist’s name in the left pane. All in all, a very handy feature.</p>

It is pretty much a clone of the Windows world’s Winamp in terms  of what it can do, but it was written from scratch, and it is very cool and capable.  With XMMS, you can play just about any kind of audio file and even listen to  Internet broadcast streams in either MP3 or Ogg format.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">XMMS actually consists of three components: the Media Player, the Equalizer, and the Playlist (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU129">Figure 13-9</a> on the next page). You can run the Media  Player alone or in conjunction with either or both of the other components, which you can open by clicking the tiny <b class="calibre13">EQ</b> button in the Media Player window  for the Equalizer, or the <b class="calibre13">PL</b> button for the Playlist. You can also move the various  components around just like a real component stereo so that they are stacked  one on top of the other, side by side, or in whatever configuration you want; just  drag things around until they all look the way you want them to. <a name="575" id="575"/><a name="IDX-179" id="IDX-179"/>

<span><span>Figure 13-9: </span> The three components of XMMS</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can run XMMS by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Sound </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Video </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  Audio Player</b>. You also used to be able to start it playing by double-clicking any  M3U, Ogg, or MP3 file (after reinstalling the MP3 support that Red Hat, the  company, removed). Now that Rhythmbox is set up as the default player in  Fedora Core, though, this is no longer the case by default. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can, however, set things up so that XMMS becomes the default audio player again, or at least appears as an option in the pop-up menu when you right- click an audio file.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To change these settings for Ogg files, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Right-click any Ogg file and then, in the pop-up menu, select <b class="calibre13">Open with </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  Other Application</b>. The Open with Other Application window will appear  (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU130">Figure 13-10</a>). </p>

<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Select <b class="calibre13">X Multimedia System</b> (XMMS) by clicking the name once, and then  click <b class="calibre13">Modify</b>. This will open a window called Modify “X Multimedia System”  (also shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU130">Figure 13-10</a>). </p>

<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In that window, choose the second item,<b class="calibre13"> Use as default for “Ogg audio”  items</b>, and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.<a name="578" id="578"/><a name="IDX-180" id="IDX-180"/>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve done this, XMMS will be the default player for Ogg files, while  Music Player (aka Rhythmbox) will still be available by right-clicking any audio  file and selecting <b class="calibre13">Open with </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Other Application </b>in the pop-up menu. Even if you later find that you like Rhythmbox more than XMMS, this way of doing  things is better, all in all, as you retain Rhythmbox’s functionality for playing your  music, while utilizing the lightness of XMMS for quickly checking audio files  when you first encounter them on the Internet or elsewhere. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have gone through this process for Ogg files, it would be an equally  good idea to do the same for MP3 files. Just right-click an MP3 file, and then  follow the same procedures.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned, XMMS can play audio files in just about any format. However,  Red Hat, the company, removed MP3 support for XMMS from its products  because of those patent and licensing issues I mentioned at the beginning of the  chapter. This means that if you want to play MP3s or MP3 streams with XMMS,  you will need to install a patch in order to do so.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you don’t believe me, or just don’t understand what I am talking about,  see for yourself. Place an MP3 file on your hard disk, and then double-click it.  XMMS will open, as will another small window, giving you a no-can-do-MP3s  message.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the coolest features of the Internet is streaming media, which is essentially live or taped audio or video Internet broadcasts. Such broadcasts can come  in a variety of streaming formats, which are basically compression formats that  allow data to move across the Net at as small a size as possible. Unfortunately,  Linux cannot yet deal with the two most common of these formats, Microsoft’s  Windows Media Player and Apple’s QuickTime, at least not in any simple way.  Fortunately there are other media streaming formats out there on the Net, such  as RealMedia. In addition, as streaming media formats are essentially space- saving compression formats, it is only natural that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, both  audio compression formats themselves, have also come to be used as streaming  media formats for Internet audio broadcasts. <a name="588" id="588"/><a name="IDX-183" id="IDX-183"/>

<h4 class="sect4-title">
<a name="589" id="589"/><a name="wbp15Chapter13P79" id="wbp15Chapter13P79"/>Ogg Vorbis Streams</h4>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition to allowing you to save music to disk in the form of Ogg files, Ogg  Vorbis is also used for streaming media across the Internet. Compared to the  number of MP3 streams, however, the number of Ogg Vorbis broadcast streams  is still rather limited. Things seem to be changing, though, and the number of  Internet broadcasters who are experimenting with Ogg Vorbis seems to be  increasing, albeit very slowly.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Radio France is a good example of one of these Ogg Vorbis broadcasters.  Radio France has a number of program streams for Internet listeners in Windows  Media Player format. It also has now begun to “expérimente” (its word, not  mine) with providing Ogg Vorbis streams for all of their broadcast programs.  The stream I recommend you try out is Fip, which is an exceedingly cool eclectic  collection of music of <i class="calibre11">all</i> genres; you will be constantly surprised by what they  play. If you are worried about language, don’t; there is very little talk, and  roughly 80 percent of the music played is in English. I don’t speak any French  other than <i class="calibre11">je suis fatigué</i>, but I have no problems at all.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you want to give streaming media in general, and Radio France in particular, a try, then right-click any open space in the main XMMS window, and from  the pop-up menu, select <b class="calibre13">Play Location</b>. In the Location window that pops up, type <span><a target="_top" href="http://ogg.tv-radio.fr:1441/encoderfip.ogg">http://ogg.tv-radio.fr:1441/encoderfip.ogg</a></span>, and then click<b class="calibre13"> OK</b>. Assuming you  are already connected to the Internet, Fip should start playing after a few seconds  of pre-buffering.<a name="590" id="590"/><a name="IDX-184" id="IDX-184"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you would like to be able to play Fip again in the future without having to type the somewhat lengthy URL each time, you can create a clickable launcher  of sorts in your Home folder by saving the Fip location as a playlist. As in the preceding section, click, but do not release, the <b class="calibre13">List</b> button in the bottom-right  corner of the Playlist window. In the pop-up menu, select <b class="calibre13">Save</b>, which will bring  up a Save Playlist window. In the Selection box at the bottom of that window, type <span>Fip.m3u</span>, and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve done all that, a Fip.m3u file will appear in your Home folder.  Now, whenever you want to listen to Fip, just double-click that icon, and XMMS  will open and start bringing you a dose of eclectia, provided, of course, that you  are connected to the Internet at the time. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you would like to try any of the other Radio France broadcast streams, go to <a target="_top" href="http://www.radiofrance.fr/services/aide/difflive.php#ogg">www.radiofrance.fr/services/aide/difflive.php#ogg,</a> and you will find a list of  addresses. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If the more traditional variety of pop and rock is your cup of tea, another  broadcaster offering Ogg Vorbis streams is Virgin Radio. Virgin Radio has both  standard pop/rock and classic rock broadcast streams. To listen to Virgin Radio,  go to the Virgin Radio site at <a target="_top" href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/thestation/listen/ogg.html">www.virginradio.co.uk/thestation/listen/ogg.html.</a>  Once there, click the appropriate link (modem or broadband) for the program  stream you’d like to hear. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you do that, Mozilla will display a window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU133">Figure 13-13</a>) to ask you  what program you want to use to open the Ogg file type. Select <b class="calibre13">Open it with</b>, and  in the accompanying box type <span>/usr/bin/xmms</span><span>. Then </span>click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. Mozilla will open  XMMS, and the Virgin Radio stream will start playing. From now on, whenever  you try to play an Ogg Vorbis stream, Mozilla will automatically start XMMS to  play it.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you have just learned, XMMS can play Ogg Vorbis streams, but now that you  have installed MP3 support, it can also play SHOUTcast MP3 streams. To give  this a try, go to <a target="_top" href="http://www.shoutcast.com">www.shoutcast.com</a> where you will see an extensive listing of  SHOUTcast MP3 streams. Once you find a stream that seems of interest to you,  click the <b class="calibre13">Tune In</b> button for that stream. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you do this, Mozilla will pop up another one of those what-should-I- do-with-this-file windows. Just type <span>/usr/bin/xmms</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Open with</b> box and click  <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and XMMS will open and soon begin playing the stream.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>, you learned how to customize the look of your system by changing  window border and application control themes. However, XMMS is configured  to hide its window bars, and it uses controls of its own, so any cosmetic changes  you make to your system will have no effect on XMMS. You can, however, directly change the look of XMMS by using its own themes, called <i class="calibre11">skins</i>. The default skin  for XMMS in Fedora Core is called Bluecurve, and it essentially follows the  default theme of the rest of the system. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before we can move on, you are going to have to install some skins to work with. This is easily enough done by running Synaptic, typing <span>xmms-skins</span> in Synaptic’s <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box, and then following the usual Synaptic download/installation  steps. Once done, you will have a hefty collection of XMMS skins to work with. If  you installed your Fedora Core or Red Hat Linux system from a 3-CD installation  disk set, the xmms-skins package is already included on the disks, so you can  install the skins by using the Package Management window instead. Just click the  <b class="calibre13">Details</b> button next to <b class="calibre13">Sound and Video</b>, and then check the checkbox next to  <b class="calibre13">xmms-skins</b> to get things rolling.<a name="597" id="597"/><a name="IDX-186" id="IDX-186"/>

Some can be so wild that you can barely use them, while others may be quite  dull yet very easy on the eye. There is also the configuration of your XMMS  components to consider. You may agree that the Ultrafina skin looks much  more handsome than the default Bluecurve skin when the components are  stacked on top of one another, as in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU135">Figure 13-15</a> on the previous page. However, place the components side by side while using Ultrafina, and it all  looks pretty weird, whereas a more traditional stereo system skin, as shown in  <a>Figure 13-17</a> on the next page, seems much more the ticket.<a name="601" id="601"/><a name="IDX-187" id="IDX-187"/>

The XMMS  site (<a target="_top" href="http://www.xmms.org">www.xmms.org</a>) has quite a few, but even more can be found on the  Winamp site (<a target="_top" href="http://classic.winamp.com/skins">http://classic.winamp.com/skins</a>). Yes, you’ve guessed right;  Winamp skins and XMMS skins are interchangeable. Just be sure <i class="calibre11">not</i> to use  those skins designed for Winamp 3, which will not work. You can tell which are  which by the file extensions: Winamp 3 skins end in .wal, Winamp 2 skins (the  XMMS compatibles) end in .zip, and native XMMS skins end in .wsz. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you find some skins that you like, download them in the usual manner.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have downloaded some new skins, you will have to make them available to XMMS by putting them in the right place on your system. You needn’t unzip  them, though; you can use them as is, which saves you some minor grief. Anyway,  at this stage of the game, this is most easily done by putting them in the <b class="calibre13"><a href="DDU0096.html#574" target="_parent">.xmms </a></b>folder within your Home folder.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Directories preceded by a dot are normally hidden from view, so either you  can go to the Preferences menu in a Nautilus window and then check <b class="calibre13">Show hidden and backup files</b> in the Preferences window, or you can just open another  Nautilus window, and in the <b class="calibre13">Location</b> box type<span> ~~/.xmms/Skins/</span> and press ENTER.  From there on in, it’s a simple drag-and-drop procedure. Just drag the  downloaded skin files directly into the Skins folder, and that is that. The next  time you open the XMMS Skin Selector, your new skins will be there waiting in  the list. All very simple.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are really into MP3s and Ogg files, a handy program you might want to add  to your repertoire is EasyTAG, which allows you to view and change the tag  information for your MP3 and Ogg files (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU137">Figure 13-18</a>). This is very handy  when you have files that are missing or have incorrect file information (artist,  title, and so on), and thus do not display that information when playing in  XMMS or other audio players. It also displays the technical details of each file.<a name="606" id="606"/><a name="IDX-188" id="IDX-188"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you like, or need, to really manipulate your sound files, then Audacity is a very  handy program (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU138">Figure 13-19</a> on the next page). Audacity is a sound editor  that allows you to load files in almost any sound format (.wav, .aiff, .au, .ogg, . mp3) and edit them in a variety of ways. For example, you might want to capture  just one phrase out of a speech, or your favorite guitar solo from a song, and use  it as a system sound, or maybe you want to permanently boost the volume of a  certain portion of a recording that didn’t come out just right the first time  around. Or maybe you just want to perform an old “expletive deleted” routine on  a saucier portion of something you are planning to play before a class of junior  high school students. You can even use Audacity to add reverberation, echo, or  other effects to a sound file. And you can use it to record your own sounds via  line-in or microphone.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The RealOne Player is now installed and set up on your machine, but in order to  use it comfortably, it is probably best to set your Mozilla Web browser so that it  will know what to do when you try to play a RealMedia stream. The easiest way to  do this is by trying to open a stream straightaway. For convenience’s sake, I will  use the National Public Radio site (<a target="_top" href="http://www.npr.org">www.npr.org</a>) as my source stream; you can,  of course, choose any stream you like. If you don’t know any streams offhand, just  follow along with me. It doesn’t really matter at this point, because our objective  is merely to set up Mozilla.<a name="620" id="620"/><a name="IDX-192" id="IDX-192"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">First, go to the site and click the link for the program stream. In the case of NPR, you will first be asked if you want to use Real Player or Windows Media  Player. Click <b class="calibre13">Real Player</b>. After doing this, Mozilla will pop up yet another what-should-I-do-with-this-file window, asking you what to do with the stream.  Check the radio button next to the <b class="calibre13">Open with</b> box, and type <span>/home/</span><i class="calibre11"><span>username</span></i><span>/RealPlayer9/realplay</span> (replacing <i class="calibre11"><span>username</span></i> with your own username, of course).  Once you’ve done that, click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and the stream should begin playing after a  few seconds of pre-buffering. The station icon for that stream, if there is one,  will also appear in the RealOne Player window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You probably won’t have to go through this process again, as Mozilla now  knows what to do with RealMedia streams. If you do happen to get asked again  somewhere along the way, follow the same steps again: Select <b class="calibre13">Open with</b>, type <span>/home/username/RealPlayer9/realplay</span>, and click<b class="calibre13"> OK</b>.<a name="621" id="621"/><a name="IDX-193" id="IDX-193"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you are all set up, you probably want some more streams to try out  right away. There are plenty of sites out there with RealMedia streams, but let  me steer you to some of my faves to get you started (you may already know some  of these):</p>
