- en: It's ten o'clock on Monday morning. The boss of the branch office is in a rage.
    He's been waiting for hours for an important e-mail, and it still hasn't arrived.
    It can only be the fault of the mail server; it's probably misbehaving yet again.
    But a quick check of the computer shows that no mails have got stuck in the queue
    there, and there's no mention either in the log file that a mail from the sender
    in question has arrived. So where's the problem?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The central mail server of the company doesn't respond to a **`ping`**. That's
    probably the root of the problem. But the IT department at the company head office
    absolutely insists that it is not to blame. It also cannot ping the mail node
    of the branch office, but it maintains that the network at the head office is
    running smoothly, so the problem must lie with the network at the branch office.
    The search for the error continues...
  prefs: []

- en: 'The humiliating result: the VPN connection to head office was down, and although
    the ISDN backup connection was working, no route to the head office (and thus
    to the central mail server) was defined in the backup router. A globally operating
    IT service provider was responsible for the network connections (VPN and ISDN)
    between branch and head office, for whom something like this "just doesn''t happen."
    The end result: many hours spent searching for the error, an irritated boss (the
    meeting for which the e-mail was urgently required has long since finished), and
    a sweating admin.'

- en: With a properly configured Nagios system, the adminstrator would already have
    noticed the problem at eight in the morning and been able to isolate its cause
    within a few minutes. Instead of losing valuable time, the IT service provider
    would have been informed directly. The time then required to eliminate the error
    (in this case, half an hour) would have been sufficient to deliver the e-mail
    in time.

    this does not cause the "lights to go out" in the operating room, the database

    cannot be admitted, examination results cannot be saved, and reports cannot be
    documented until the problem has been fixed.'

    really afford to regularly check all systems manually. Networks that are growing
    more and more complex especially demand the need to be informed early on of disruptions
    that have occurred or of problems that are about to happen. Nagios, the Open Source
    tool for system and network monitoring, helps the administrator to detect problems
    before the phone rings off the hook.
  prefs: []

- en: The aim of the software is to inform administrators quickly about questionable
    (WARNING) or critical conditions (CRITICAL). What is regarded as "questionable"
    or "critical" is defined by the administrator in the configuration. A Web page
    summary then informs the administrator of normally working systems and services,
    which Nagios displays in green, of questionable conditions (yellow), and of critical
    situations (red). There is also the possibility of informing the administrators
    in charge—depending on specific services or systems—selectively by e-mail but
    also by paging services such as SMS.

- en: By concentrating on stop light states (green, yellow, red), Nagios is distinct
    from network tools that display elapsed time graphically (for example in the load
    of a WAN interface or a CPU throughout an entire day) or that record and measure
    network traffic (how high was the proportion of HTTP on a particular interface?).
    Nagios is involved plainly and simply with the issue of whether everything is
    on a green light. The software does an excellent job in looking after this, not
    just in terms of the current status but also over long periods of time.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When checking critical hosts and services, Nagios distinguishes between host
    and service checks. A *host check* tests a computer, called a *host* in Nagios
    slang, for reachability—as a rule, a simple **`ping`** is used. A *service check*
    selectively tests individual network services such as HTTP, SMTP, DNS, etc., but
    also running processes, CPU load, or log files. Host checks are performed by Nagios
    irregularly and only where required, for example if none of the services to be
    monitored can be reached on the host being monitored. As long as one service can
    be addressed there, then this is basically valid for the entire computer, so this
    test can be dropped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest test for network services consists of looking to see whether the
    relevant target port is open, and whether a service is listening there. But this
    does not necessarily mean that, for example, the SSH daemon really is running
    on TCP port 22\. Nagios therefore uses tests for many services that go several
    steps further. With SMTP, for example, the software also tests whether the mail
    server announces itself with a "220" output, the so-called *SMTP greeting*; and
    for a PostgreSQL database, it checks whether this will accept an SQL query.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nagios becomes especially interesting through the fact that it takes into account
    dependencies in the network topology (if it is configured to do so). If the target
    system can only be reached through a particular router that has just gone down,
    then Nagios reports that the target system is "unreachable" and does not bother
    to bombard it with further host and service checks. The software puts administrators
    in a position where they can more quickly detect the actual cause and rectify
    the situation.

- en: The great strength of Nagios—even in comparison with other network monitoring
    tools—lies in its modular structure. The Nagios core does not contain one single
    test. Instead it uses external programs for service and host checks, which are
    known as *plugins*. The basic equipment already contains a number of standard
    plugins for the most important application cases. Special requests that go beyond
    these are answered—provided that you have basic programming knowledge—by plugins
    that you can write yourself. Before investing time in developing these, however,
    it is first worth taking a look on the Internet and browsing through the relevant
    mailing lists,^([[2](#ftn.PREFACE-FN-2)]) as there is lively activity in this
    area. Ready-to-use plugins are available, especially in The Nagios Exchange platform,
    [http://www.nagiosexchange.org/](http://www.nagiosexchange.org/).

    of providing measurement data or events as information that can be evaluated by

    is, with the host or service check) you can configure when each group of persons—the
    so-called *contact groups*—are informed about which conditions or events (failure,
    recovery, warnings, etc.). On the receiver side you can also define on multiple
    levels what is to be done with a corresponding message—for example whether the
    system should forward it, depending on the time of day, or discard the message.

    this does not mean that the administrator in charge will never be able to take
    a break. For example, you can instruct Nagios to notify the person only from Monday
    to Friday between 8am and 5pm, every two hours at the most. If the administrator
    in charge is not able to solve the problem within a specified period of time,
    eight hours for example, then the head of department responsible should receive
    a message. This process is known as *escalation management*. The corresponding
    configuration is explained in [Chapter 12](../Text/ch12.html "Chapter 12. The
    Nagios Notification System") from page 282.

    admin needs a summary of the overall situation, a display of problematic services
    and hosts and the causes of network outages, or the status of entire groups of
    hosts or services, Nagios provides an individually structured information page
    for nearly every purpose.

    can send status information and commands to Nagios. The Web interface makes widespread
    use of this possibility, which allows the administrator to send interactive commands
    to Nagios. But a backup program unknown to Nagios can also transmit a success
    or failure to Nagios, as well as to a syslog daemon. The possibilities are limitless.
    Thanks to this interface, Nagios allows distributed monitoring. This involves
    several decentralized Nagios installations sending their test results to a central
