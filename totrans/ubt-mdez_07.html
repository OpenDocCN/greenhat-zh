Some people are very organized, placing every file in a logically named folder as soon as that file is saved for the first time. Then there are people like me, who save everything to the desktop until it is so full of junk that they can no longer make out the wallpaper, and only at that point do they start organizing in earnest (if placing all of those files in a single folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>March17Cleanup</em></span> can be called organizing).</p><p>Of course, not only do files get stored on your hard disk, but they are also copied to and from CDs, DVDs, external hard disks, flash drives, and other storage media and devices. They are also often saved in archives, which are then compressed to reduce their size, making them easier to send via email or to fit onto removable storage media.</p><p>With that introduction, you may have already guessed that in this chapter I will be dealing with file handling in Ubuntu, particularly in relation to the file search in the Dash and the Nautilus file manager, which is at the heart of Ubuntu’s file-handling capabilities.</p><div class="sect1" title="Find It Fast—Searching for Files with the Dash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="find_it_fastmsearching_for_files_with_th"/>Find It Fast—Searching for Files with the Dash</h1></div></div></div><p>If you’re anything like me, you’ve been collecting computer files for quite some time now. My laptop is packed full of files, from vacation photos, letters, financial documents and spreadsheets to my music collection, home videos, ebooks, and work documents. It even hosts a bunch of files from my Windows days—bad computer artwork, unfinished poems, and old desktop background pictures. There is a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of stuff—too much stuff, in fact. There’s a point at which even the most competent organizational mind has to throw his hands in the air and admit defeat: It’s practically impossible to keep so many files organized while at the same time having easy access to them. And that’s where the Dash comes in.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0008"/></p><p>As you’ve already seen in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A New Place to Call Home">Chapter 3</a>, the Dash has a rather powerful search feature. All you need to do is open the Dash and start typing. Then, within a second or two, search results from the four corners of your computer will start to flood in. After that, you can use lenses and filters to narrow your search results until you find whatever you’re looking for. Nothing more to it, right?<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0009"/></p><p>Well. . . not <span class="emphasis"><em>quite</em></span>. In addition to the basic search and filtering features I mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A New Place to Call Home">Chapter 3</a>, the Dash also has some nifty extras to help you find your files. In this section, I’ll take you on a whistle-stop tour of what’s on offer, accompanied by a neat trick or two that just might help you find it faster (whatever “it” is). Read on!</p><div class="sect2" title="Recent Files and Downloads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="recent_files_and_downloads"/>Recent Files and Downloads</h2></div></div></div><p>As you’ve probably already established, searching is the quickest way to find files. But when you first open the Dash, you’ll see that three bands of results are displayed before you’ve even typed a thing. At the top is a list of applications that you’ve recently used; forget that for now. In the middle, you’ll see a band called <span class="emphasis"><em>Recent Files</em></span>, and you’ll see <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> below that. The Recent Files band is, unsurprisingly, a short list of the files you’ve been working with recently. If you’re looking for that letter you wrote yesterday, there’s no need to search for it—it’ll probably be right there in this list.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0010"/></p><p>The Downloads band is also pretty handy if, like me, you spend quite a bit of time on the Web. It’s a list of all of the files that you recently downloaded with your web browser, as explained in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Slipping and Sliding">Chapter 5</a>. Everything you save off the Web is stored in a special <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> folder for future reference, so there’s no need to sit around scratching your head, wondering which website you found that tax form on last week—it’s probably somewhere in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> folder.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding More Elusive Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_more_elusive_files"/>Finding More Elusive Files</h2></div></div></div><p>What if you can’t find the file that you were looking for? There are a number of things to try. The first is to double-check what you are searching for. The search in the Dash isn’t case sensitive (you can use uppercase and lowercase letters, and it doesn’t care), but it does care about spelling. If the search term you use doesn’t appear somewhere in the name of the file, exactly as you typed it, then it won’t show up in the search results. Also, be aware that the search doesn’t look inside the files—only at the name of the file. Say, for example, that you wrote a word-processed document with the title “Clouds Are Fluffy” and saved it with the filename <span class="emphasis"><em>clouds.doc</em></span>. Searching for <span class="emphasis"><em>clouds</em></span> would find the file, but searching for <span class="emphasis"><em>fluffy</em></span> would not. Where you saved the file also matters: In general, most of the places where you might save files are fine (they should be in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Home folder</em></span>, which you’ll learn more about shortly), but if you put it on a removable USB memory stick, it won’t show up in the results.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0012"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="A Closer Look at Lenses and Filters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a_closer_look_at_lenses_and_filters"/>A Closer Look at Lenses and Filters</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, there are just too many files. No matter what you type into that search box, however specific, you still end up with tens, or even hundreds, of search results. As you’ve already seen, the Dash comes equipped with a few handy tools to help you wade through the deluge in the form of lenses and filters. In this section, I’ll show you how to get the most out of the three file-based lenses—<span class="emphasis"><em>Files &amp; Folders</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Videos</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0014"/></p><div class="sect3" title="Files &amp; Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="files_a_folders"/>Files &amp; Folders</h3></div></div></div><p>To bring up the Files &amp; Folders lens, click the icon that looks like a folded-over sheet of paper at the bottom of the Dash. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Filter results</strong></span>, and a host of new options will appear down the right-hand side of the screen (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#filtering_search_results_in_the_files_a" title="Figure 7-1. Filtering search results in the Files &amp; Folders lens">Figure 7-1</a>). You can filter the search results by <span class="emphasis"><em>Last modified</em></span> (the last time the file was changed), <span class="emphasis"><em>Type</em></span> (what sort of file it is), and <span class="emphasis"><em>Size</em></span> (how much disk space it takes up). Click on any of the options under those headings to narrow the search; you can select several at once, if you like. To deselect an option, just click on it again, or, if you want to remove all of the filters, click the <span class="strong"><strong>All</strong></span> button next to each of the headings.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0015"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="filtering_search_results_in_the_files_a"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e5893"/><img alt="Filtering search results in the Files &amp; Folders lens" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263578.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-1. Filtering search results in the Files &amp; Folders lens</p></div><p>For concreteness, let’s consider an example of how you might use filters to find a file. Your Uncle Garfield is coming over in a couple of hours, and he absolutely loves lasagna. As luck would have it, you remember writing up a delicious lasagna recipe a couple of months ago, seasoned to perfection following a particularly successful session of experimentation with your herb collection. But where’d that pesky recipe go? You open the Dash, type <strong class="userinput"><code>recipe</code></strong>, and, unsurprisingly for a culinary whiz such as yourself, 112 results appear. A quick scan of the first few files reveals pictures of your marvelous creations, a few word-processed documents containing recipes, and a song or two off the Ray Charles album <span class="emphasis"><em>Ingredients in a Recipe for Soul</em></span>. Hmm, not so helpful. So what do you do?<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0018"/></p><p>Wading through the results one by one seems like a chore, so click through to the Files &amp; Folders lens and click <span class="strong"><strong>Filter results</strong></span>. You usually write up recipes using a word processor (more on that in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Penguins at Work">Chapter 12</a>), so you know that the recipe must be in a regular document—it’s not an audio or video file, at least. The thing to do here is to select Documents from under the Type filter. The search is narrowed, and the photos and songs vanish from the results. There are still 40 results left, though. Since you only came up with the recipe a couple of months back, you click <span class="strong"><strong>Last year</strong></span> under the Last modified filter (meaning that files modified in the last year will be shown). <span class="emphasis"><em>Et voilá</em></span>, there’s the lasagna recipe, peeking out at you from a rather more manageable list of only 12 search results. <span class="emphasis"><em>Bon appetit!</em></span></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Music"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="music"/>Music</h3></div></div></div><p>What with iPods and other audio devices attaining ever higher capacities and online music stores gaining in popularity, large digital music collections have now become the norm. A quick perusal of my own collection reveals 3,206 songs by 202 artists. That’s the equivalent of some nine nonstop days of music! No matter how your audiophilia compares to mine, you have to admit that finding that one favorite Christmas song in among the rest of it would be a daunting task without some trusty computerized assistance. You’ll learn more about managing your music collection in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Tux Rocks">Chapter 14</a>, using a handy app called Rhythmbox, but in the meantime, the Dash has plenty to offer the music maestro in you.</p><p>Click the musical note symbol at the bottom of the Dash, and your music collection will be spread out before you, assuming that you’ve already transferred it onto the computer (if not, see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Tux Rocks">Chapter 14</a> to learn how to do this). In exactly the same manner as you work with other parts of the Dash, you can start typing to search. Unlike searching for other types of file, however, the Music search is capable of matching more than just a song’s filename—it also looks as the song title, artist name, and album title. What’s more, the search results will come back with the album artwork displayed for each song—a nice touch that makes the experience that little bit closer to rooting through physical stacks of records.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0019"/></p><p>When you search for something, the results will be displayed in three bands this time—Songs, Albums, and Available for purchase. The last one has to do with the music store that’s built into Ubuntu—more on that in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Tux Rocks">Chapter 14</a>. The first two show only those songs and albums that are currently saved on your computer. From here on, it’s pretty similar to what you had with the Files &amp; Folders lens—you can click <span class="strong"><strong>Show more results</strong></span> to see a full list of everything that matches your search terms, and you can click <span class="strong"><strong>Filter results</strong></span> to narrow your search. The only difference is that, this time, you can filter by <span class="emphasis"><em>Decade</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Genre</em></span> rather than by <span class="emphasis"><em>Size</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>File</em></span> type. Neat, huh?</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Videos"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="videos"/>Videos</h3></div></div></div><p>It’s not just music that gets a lens all to itself in the Dash. There’s also a Video lens, with an icon that looks like a film strip with an arrow on it. I’ll spare you the details—it works in a very similar manner to the other lenses—except to pick out one rather fun feature. Open up the Dash, bring up the Video lens by clicking its icon, and search for <span class="emphasis"><em>cat</em></span>. If you’re connected to the Internet, you’ll see a band of results called Online with a number of pictures of some feline or another. What’s happening here is that the Dash is searching through a bunch of popular video websites, like YouTube and Vimeo, and bringing the results directly to your screen. If you click <span class="strong"><strong>Filter results</strong></span> and expand the section called <span class="emphasis"><em>Sources</em></span>, you can see a full list of the websites that are being searched. Click one of the videos, and it’ll pop up in your web browser, ready to view. Ubuntu Dash: the perfect procrastination tool.

It’s not so useful if you need to move, collect, or otherwise organize your files, though. It’s also light on more advanced features, like accessing files over the network and transferring documents to USB memory sticks and other devices. Fortunately, Ubuntu has something a bit more substantial to handle that sort of thing in the form of Nautilus. Nautilus is the program that creates the file-viewing and organizing interface on your system. You may not have thought of an operating system’s file manager as a program before, but in fact, that is what it is. (The Windows file manager is called Windows Explorer.) To take a look at Nautilus, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Home folder</strong></span> icon in the Launcher, as marked out in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#the_home_folder_icon_in_the_launcher" title="Figure 7-2. The Home folder icon in the Launcher">Figure 7-2</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0027"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_home_folder_icon_in_the_launcher"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6035"/><img alt="The Home folder icon in the Launcher" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263580.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-2. The Home folder icon in the Launcher</p></div><p>When Nautilus opens to your Home folder (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#the_contents_of_your_home_folder_as_view" title="Figure 7-3. The contents of your Home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window">Figure 7-3</a>), you will find that you can store your files thematically: Documents, Downloads, <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Public</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Templates</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Videos</em></span>. Another folder, titled <span class="emphasis"><em>Desktop</em></span>, will show everything you have stored on your desktop (a lot in my case; most likely nothing in yours), if double-clicked. Yet another folder, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples</em></span>, contains sample files that give you an idea of what Ubuntu has in store for you.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0029"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_contents_of_your_home_folder_as_view"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6075"/><img alt="The contents of your Home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263582.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-3. The contents of your Home folder as viewed in a Nautilus window</p></div><p>You can create additional folders and files to your heart’s content, so this preconfigured state of affairs is sure to change once you get down to really using your system. In fact, you will be making some changes in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Dressing Up the Bird">Chapter 9</a> that will make everything look a bit more lived in.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_sidebar"/>The Sidebar</h2></div></div></div><p>Nautilus has a lot of interesting features that deserve mention, and the most obvious of these is the sidebar, which appears at the left side of the window. The sidebar allows you to view a variety of information via a couple of selectable views. You can make your choices by going to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> in the menu and choosing either Places or Tree.</p><p>The default view in Ubuntu is Places, which is a sort of quick navigation tool. In Places, you will find icons representing various data-storage locations available to your system, such as your Home folder, desktop, full filesystem, any network shares you are connected to (more on that in a moment), and any removable storage media or devices you have in or connected to your system. Clicking any of these icons will show the contents of that location in the right panel of the Nautilus window. The other view is Tree, which provides you with an expandable hierarchical view of your filesystem.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Now You See It; Now You Don’t"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="now_you_see_it_semicolon_now_you_donat"/>Now You See It; Now You Don’t</h2></div></div></div><p>The sidebar is a handy feature, but sometimes you may prefer to have more space to view the contents of your window and thus want to get rid of the bar temporarily. You can do this easily by going to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> in the Nautilus menu and then deselecting <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span>. The checkmark next to that entry will disappear, as will the sidebar. (Alternatively, press the <span class="keycap">F9</span> key on the keyboard to do the same.) To get the sidebar back, just return to the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Sidebar</strong></span> again. The checkmark will reappear, as will the sidebar itself.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0031"/></p><p>If you’d prefer not to hide the sidebar but would still appreciate a little more space, you can change its width instead. Move your mouse over the narrow gray line that marks the boundary between the sidebar and the rest of the window (note that there’s also a subtle change in the shade of the background color on either side of the line). When it’s hovering exactly over the line, the mouse pointer will change from its usual appearance, a single arrow, to a horizontal pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions. This tells you that the border of the sidebar, the thin gray line, can be dragged in order to resize the sidebar. Getting the pointer directly over the line can be a little frustrating, in that it might take a few goes to get the double arrow to appear, but once it does, click and drag to resize the sidebar.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="File Handling in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="file_handling_in_nautilus"/>File Handling in Nautilus</h1></div></div></div><p>Since Nautilus is primarily a file manager, it only makes sense to get down to the business of using it at that level. Of course, most folks who use computers today are already familiar with the basics of drag-and-drop and a few other means of creating folders and copying, cutting, and moving files. But if you’re unfamiliar with one way or another of performing these essential procedures, no worries—I’ll spell it all out.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_comma_naming_comma_and_renaming"/>Creating, Naming, and Renaming Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a folder is a simple enough task, and there are two ways of going about it. The easiest (in my opinion) is to right-click any empty space within a Nautilus window and select <span class="strong"><strong>Create Folder</strong></span> in the pop-up menu that appears. If you prefer using menus over right-clicking empty space, you can instead start things rolling by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Folder</strong></span>.</p><p>Regardless of where you made your Create Folder selection, a new folder with the name <span class="emphasis"><em>Untitled Folder</em></span> will appear in the Nautilus window. The name box of the folder will be highlighted and surrounded with a black box, which means you can immediately give that folder a name by simply typing one—nothing to click or do other than that. Press <span class="keycap">enter</span> or click any open space in the Nautilus window to complete the job.</p><p>If you later decide that the name you gave your folder needs some tweaking or even a complete revision, you can rename it by right-clicking it and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Rename</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can click the folder once to highlight it and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Rename</strong></span>. After that, you can type the new name for the folder and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, or you can click any open space in the Nautilus window to seal the deal.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Moving Files and Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="moving_files_and_folders"/>Moving Files and Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the easiest of all file manipulations you can perform in Nautilus is moving a file by means of drag-and-drop. There is another way of moving files and folders, however: cut-and-paste.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0035"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0037"/></p><p>The easiest way to cut and paste is to right-click the file (or folder) you want to move and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Cut</strong></span> from the pop-up menu (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Cut</strong></span> will also do the trick). At this point, it will seem as if nothing has happened because the file will still be there, but don’t worry.</p><p>After that, right-click any open space in the folder to which you want to move the file and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Paste</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. The file will disappear from its original location and appear in its new one.</p><p>Can you use key combinations to do this? Sure. Follow the directions I just gave, but press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-X to cut and <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-V to paste.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Copying Files and Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copying_files_and_folders"/>Copying Files and Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>Based on the instructions you just read, you can pretty well imagine how you’ll copy files and folders, because copying is essentially a variation on the same theme. Just right-click the file you want to copy, select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> from the pop-up menu, right-click any open space within the target location, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Paste</strong></span>. Keystroke-wise, that would be <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-C to copy and, as before, <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-V to paste.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0039"/></p><p>It is also possible to copy folders and files via the wonders of drag-and-drop, though this involves more hands than required for a drag-and-drop move; fortunately, the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold the <span class="keycap">ctrl</span> key while you drag the file or folder you want to copy to the target location. Be sure to release the mouse button first and then the <span class="keycap">ctrl</span> key (releasing in the opposite order will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its new location and the original still safely where it was.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Navigating in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="navigating_in_nautilus"/>Navigating in Nautilus</h1></div></div></div><p>Navigating through your various folders and subfolders in Nautilus is quite straightforward. In fact, all is conceptually pretty much the same as what you are accustomed to in Windows and Mac OS. You can simply move into and out of folders through a combination of double-clicking folders and clicking the Back and Forward buttons.</p><div class="sect2" title="Browsing with Breadcrumbs in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="browsing_with_breadcrumbs_in_nautilus"/>Browsing with Breadcrumbs in Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to the hierarchical view option provided in the side pane, another handy feature can make your navigation chores even easier: Nautilus’s breadcrumb bar feature. As you wander ever deeper into your forest of folders, Nautilus will leave a trail of breadcrumbs (they look like buttons, actually) in the navigation bar for each folder you opened on the way to the one you are currently viewing.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0040"/></p><p>Say, for example, that you have a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> inside a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>Dalarna</em></span> inside a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>SwedeStuff</em></span> inside a folder called NordicStuff, which itself is in your Home folder. As you click your way to that <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> folder, starting by double-clicking the <span class="emphasis"><em>NordicStuff</em></span> folder, Nautilus will display a button for that folder . . . and any folder opened before it. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#breadcrumb_navigation_in_nautilus" title="Figure 7-4. Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus">Figure 7-4</a> to see what I mean.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0042"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="breadcrumb_navigation_in_nautilus"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6309"/><img alt="Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263584.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-4. Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus</p></div><p>As you can see, there is a button for each of the folders within the path from your Home folder to your target: <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span>.

Yes, Nautilus lets you bookmark folders to which you have navigated. Although you are probably familiar with creating bookmarks for web pages that you frequent, you may be wondering why on Earth you would want to create bookmarks within your filesystem.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0043"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0044"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0045"/></p><p>Well, imagine that you have a folder you need to use often, but it is even more buried than my <span class="emphasis"><em>gooseberries</em></span> folder in the previous section. Getting there would take an excessive number of mouse clicks, and all that clicking is bound to eventually give you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Although that is great for your doctor, it is most decidedly not good for you. Instead of maiming yourself, you could click your way to that folder once and then, in the Nautilus window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Add Bookmark</strong></span>. After that, whenever you want to get back to that buried folder, you can just click the Bookmarks menu, and the folder will be right there waiting for you in the drop-down list.</p><p>Another handy thing about Nautilus bookmarks is that they also appear in Save As dialogs, such as when you save a LibreOffice document or download a file via Firefox. To use them in any such Save As dialog, just find your bookmark in the list on the left-hand side.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Understanding the Linux Filesystem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="understanding_the_linux_filesystem"/>Understanding the Linux Filesystem</h2></div></div></div><p>With all that path typing, navigating, and bookmarking you’ve just learned, you should pretty much be able to figure out how to get from here to there in your Home folder. Still, it’s probably a good idea to know where your Home folder actually is in the scheme of things, just in case you manage to get yourself really lost someday. To understand this, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux filesystem, which, as you will find, is a bit different from what you were accustomed to in your previous operating system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0046"/></p><p>Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem all stems from a single point called <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> and is represented by a solitary forward slash (/). Your own user account folder is located within a subfolder of root called <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span>. This is represented as <span class="emphasis"><em>/home</em></span> or, to put it into words, the Home folder within root. If your user account were to have the same name as mine, <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>, the path to that folder would be <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg</em></span>, or the <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span> folder within <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span> within root. Whatever the name of your user account or the names of any other accounts you have on your machine happen to be, just remember that when you are lost, your folder and those of all the other folks with user accounts on your machine are located within the Home folder. If you’re a more graphically oriented person, the map in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#the_location_of_your_usersa_folders_with" title="Figure 7-6. The location of your users’ folders within the Linux filesystem">Figure 7-6</a> should help you.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0047"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0048"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0049"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0050"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0051"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_location_of_your_usersa_folders_with"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6460"/><img alt="The location of your users’ folders within the Linux filesystem" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263588.png"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-6. The location of your users’ folders within the Linux filesystem</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="What’s in All Those Other Folders?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="whatas_in_all_those_other_folders_questi"/>What’s in All Those Other Folders?</h2></div></div></div><p>Needless to say, there is more to the Linux filesystem than the root, Home, and user account folders. Several other directories appear at the same level as Home, though for the most part, you shouldn’t be mucking around with them unless you know what you’re doing. Fortunately, most of these folders are write protected, so you should be fairly well protected from yourself. Still, it is natural to be curious about what those other folders are there for, since . . . well, they’re there. So, to satisfy your curiosity a bit, I’ll do a little explaining.</p><p>In Ubuntu, four folders contain most of the applications on your system. The essential elements of your system are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/sbin</em></span>. Other elements that need to be there such as commands and the like, though they may not be used, are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/bin</em></span>. Most of the applications that you actually think of as applications and use in a hands-on way are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr</em></span>. Finally, some add-on applications, such as RealPlayer, install themselves into <span class="emphasis"><em>/opt</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0053"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0056"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0057"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0058"/></p><p>Three other top-level folders that might be of interest to you are <span class="emphasis"><em>/etc</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>/lib</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>/media</em></span>. The first of these, <span class="emphasis"><em>/etc</em></span>, is the location of all the configuration files on your system. The second, <span class="emphasis"><em>/lib</em></span>, is the home of all of the libraries that are required by your system or applications installed on it. These libraries are the Linux equivalent of a Windows <span class="emphasis"><em>.dll</em></span> file. Finally, <span class="emphasis"><em>/media</em></span> is where the contents of your various attached external media (such as USB drives and CDs) appear when present.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0059"/></p><p>There are other top-level folders, but their purposes are a bit less straightforward for the average Linux newbie and, to be honest, probably not all that interesting to you at this stage. Anyway, as I mentioned, there is no reason for you to be mucking around with any of these folders for the time being, because you can access the items located within them in different, and much safer, ways.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Nautilus as a Network Browser"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_nautilus_as_a_network_browser"/>Using Nautilus as a Network Browser</h2></div></div></div><p>Another handy Nautilus feature is its ability to function as a network browser. You can, for example, see what networks and shares are available to you on your home or office network by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Browse Network</strong></span> in the Network section in the sidebar of the Nautilus window or by going to the Go menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span>. Icons for any networks or computers on that network would then appear in the Nautilus window, as in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#viewing_the_computers_on_your_network" title="Figure 7-7. Viewing the computers on your network">Figure 7-7</a>. From that window, you can double-click your way to a share that you have permission to access, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder of a Windows machine or the public folders of a Mac. In case you are wondering what a share is, I’ll clear that up for you: A <span class="emphasis"><em>network share</em></span> is a location on a computer, such as a folder, where other users on a network can access and save files. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder on a Windows system is a good example. Other users on a network can copy files from and (usually) write files to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Documents</em></span> folder, whereas they cannot access any other part of the filesystem on that host computer.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_the_computers_on_your_network"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6568"/><img alt="Viewing the computers on your network" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263590.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-7. Viewing the computers on your network</p></div><p>If the share you are trying to open requires a username and password, you will be asked for those in a new window. Note that, in this case, the username and password you need to enter are those for the computer to which you are trying to connect—not the ones you’re using in Ubuntu (unless the usernames and/or passwords happen to be the same, of course). You can then copy files to and from that share as if it were a folder on your own hard disk.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0060"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0061"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0062"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0064"/></p><p>In some cases, especially when trying to access shares on a Mac running OS X, the double-click method may not work. You will not be able to access any share on a particular machine, even if an icon for that machine appears in the Nautilus window. In such cases, double-click the icon for the machine you are trying to access and then, once it’s open (to an empty window), select <span class="strong"><strong>Go</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span>. A text box will appear in the location bar (just as in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#typing_the_path_to_your_target_folder" title="Figure 7-5. Typing the path to your target folder">Figure 7-5</a>) with the location of the machine you are trying to access already listed.</p><p>To that location, add a forward slash (/) followed by the username used on the target machine. For example, if the target machine is called <span class="emphasis"><em>cowboycats</em></span> and the username is <span class="emphasis"><em>mewtoyou</em></span>, the location would be <code class="literal">smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou</code>. You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the machine, as long as you know the path to that folder, by adding to the path you’ve already typed—<code class="literal">smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou/Documents</code>, for example. If you prefer, you can type <strong class="userinput"><code>smb://</code></strong> and your Mac’s IP address, which consists of a set of four numbers separated by dots. In the case of one of my machines, I would type <strong class="userinput"><code>smb://192.168.0.100</code></strong>. (You can find a Mac’s IP address by going to the Mac’s System Preferences, clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Sharing</strong></span>, and then clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Sharing</strong></span>. The address should appear immediately below the service selection pane.)</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In case you are wondering, the <code class="literal">smb</code> at the head of that path stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>server message block</em></span>, but to make things easier (and perhaps more useful in terms of your memory), you can just think of it as being short for <span class="emphasis"><em>Samba</em></span>, which is software used by Unix-based systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X) in order to interact with Windows networks.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0065"/></p></div><p>Once you’ve made your way to the folder you want to browse on the networked machine you’ve connected to, it might be a good idea to use the bookmark function in Nautilus to bookmark that open share window. You can then easily access that share in the future by choosing the share’s name in the Nautilus Bookmarks menu. Pretty cool, no?</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Nautilus as an FTP Client"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_nautilus_as_an_ftp_client"/>Using Nautilus as an FTP Client</h2></div></div></div><p>Not only does Nautilus allow you to browse and mount shares on local networks, but it can also act as a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client. FTP is used, for example, when you want to change the files for your website on a remote server. To do this, go to the Connect to Server window (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Connect to Server</strong></span>) and then select <span class="strong"><strong>FTP (with login)</strong></span> for the service type. Type the information provided by your website host and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Connect</strong></span> button. An FTP Network Share icon will appear in the sidebar. Click that icon, type your password (for that account—not the one for your Ubuntu system, unless it happens to be the same) when prompted to do so, and you will be able to view and add to the files you have there.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="File and Folder Permissions Within Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="file_and_folder_permissions_within_nauti"/>File and Folder Permissions Within Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>As you make your way in the world of Ubuntu, you will find that occasionally you’ll come across files or folders that are in some way locked in terms of your being able to read them, alter them, or both. These readability and alterability states are referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>permissions</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0066"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0067"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0068"/></p><p>Now, you may be wondering what the point of this permissions business is, so I will give you some examples of how it can be useful. Let’s say you have some files that you don’t want your spouse or kids to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas shopping list, for example. By denying read permission to those files or to a folder containing those files, you keep anyone else from sneaking a peek unless that person is savvy at changing permissions and has the permissions necessary to change permissions for those files or folders.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0069"/></p><p>As another example, imagine you have a file that you have worked many hours on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might accidentally ruin that file in some way, you could deny yourself write permission. By doing this, you wouldn’t be able to save any changes you make to that file. You would be given the Save As option so that you could save a new copy of the file, but if you wanted to change the original file, you would have to change the permissions. When you place such restrictions on a file or folder, a lock emblem appears on the icon for it, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#nautilus_tells_you_when_permissions_rest" title="Figure 7-8. Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement.">Figure 7-8</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0070"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="nautilus_tells_you_when_permissions_rest"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e6711"/><img alt="Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263592.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-8. Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="changing_file_and_folder_permissions_in"/>Changing File and Folder Permissions in Nautilus</h2></div></div></div><p>To change file or folder permissions in Nautilus, right-click the file or folder in question and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.

In general, however, you needn’t worry all that much about setting permissions for your own files, because you are really the only one who has access to your user account. One possible exception you might run into is when you transfer files from CD to your hard disk. In this case, the files might be write protected, meaning you cannot alter the files until you change the permissions for them. You can change the permissions of such files in order to allow yourself to alter them by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Owner</strong></span> section of the Properties window and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Read and write</strong></span> in the menu next to the word Access (for files) or <span class="strong"><strong>Create and delete files</strong></span> in the menu next to the words File access (for folders).

An ISO is an image of a CD’s file contents, which means that it is the CD minus the media itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the ISO would be the soul of a CD; take away the CD’s metal and plastic, and the remaining data would be an ISO.</p><p>It is of course impossible to download a physical CD over the Internet, but the bodiless ISOs are the next best thing. For example, to get a working copy of Ubuntu from the Web, you usually need to download an ISO, which you then burn onto a blank CD in order to give the images their bodies back, so to speak. In the process, you create the working installation disc that you need to install Ubuntu.</p><p>Fortunately, burning an ISO to disc is a pretty simple chore. Just open a Nautilus window and locate the icon for the ISO file you want to burn to disc. Right-click the icon, and in the pop-up menu that appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Write to Disc</strong></span>.

While you’re probably not going around creating your own Linux distros, you might come up with a set of files that you need to repeatedly burn to disc now or in the future, for example. To create your own ISO, follow the normal process for creating a data CD, but when the CD/DVD Creator window (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#setting_options_before_burning_a_cd_or_d" title="Figure 7-12. Setting options before burning a CD or DVD">Figure 7-12</a>) appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Image File</strong></span> from the drop-down menu and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>.

These are CDs on which data is added one session at a time. For example, you burn a few files to disc today and add a few more to the disc tomorrow and a few more files the day after that. Each time you burn additional files to the same disc, you are adding a session, which explains the name <span class="emphasis"><em>multisession</em></span>. You can basically think of the CDs as working like floppy disks (albeit with a lot more storage capacity).</p><p>Nautilus has basic support for multisession discs, but let’s try something a little more specialized this time: Brasero, which is a more fully featured application that you can use for all of your disc-burning chores.</p><p>You can run Brasero by searching for Brasero Disc Burner in the Dash.

Your printer is very likely a USB device, as is your scanner. And although your digital camera is not a USB device in the traditional sense, chances are that every time you connect it to your computer in order to transfer photos, you are doing so via a USB connector. Among the most popular USB devices out there are those used for file storage. These include external hard disks; flash memory card readers; and the tiny, finger-sized devices known as <span class="emphasis"><em>flash drives</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#usb_storage_devices-id1" title="Figure 7-15. USB storage devices">Figure 7-15</a>). Flash drives are especially popular today and deservedly so: They are inexpensive, handy when you need to transfer large amounts of data, and pretty safe in terms of cross-platform (including Linux) compatibility.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0086"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0087"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0088"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0089"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="usb_storage_devices-id1"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7214"/><img alt="USB storage devices" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263606.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-15. USB storage devices</p></div><p>Working with USB storage devices is easy. Just plug the device into one of the USB ports on your computer. The LED on the device will do a bit of blinking while the system reads what’s on it, and a few moments later, a Nautilus window will open, revealing the contents of the device. An icon for the USB device will also appear in the sidebar of the Nautilus window and at the bottom of the Launcher. You can then copy files to and from the device using the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste procedures I mentioned earlier in this chapter.</p><p>Once you are done and want to remove the device, right-click its icon in the Launcher or in the Nautilus sidebar and select <span class="strong"><strong>Safely Remove Drive</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. If there is any data that needs to be written to the device, the system will start writing. Once it’s complete, the icon for the device will disappear from Nautilus. Make sure that you always safely remove USB drives like this, rather than by simply disconnecting them—otherwise, you risk losing data.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Working with Bluetooth Devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="working_with_bluetooth_devices"/>Working with Bluetooth Devices</h1></div></div></div><p>While we’re on the topic of file handling, it is probably a good time to learn how to work with Bluetooth devices.

Well, now it’s time to dust off your spring-cleaning gear and give your Home folder the once over.</p><p>The first stop is the Trash. Sometimes I’m surprised by just how much stuff accumulates here; I can go for weeks on end without emptying it. Luckily, this trash lacks the unpleasant odor of its real-world counterpart, so all that stands in your way is a quick check to make sure you didn’t accidentally throw away anything important. Click the Trash icon at the bottom of the Launcher, and when the window opens, click <span class="strong"><strong>Empty Trash</strong></span> to delete all the files in there. They will be deleted permanently, with no way of getting them back.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0105"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0106"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0107"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0108"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0109"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0110"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0111"/></p><p>Next up is something a little more sophisticated. If you’re running low on hard disk space and want to know why (or just want to snoop around your files a little), open the Dash and search for <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Usage Analyzer</strong></span>. Open it and, when the window appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Scan Home</strong></span>. Wait a while as your folders are sized up. A colorful ring chart will appear, accompanied by a list showing where all your hard disk space is being eaten up. Hover the mouse over one of the colored segments on the chart to see what’s taking up the most room or double-click one of the segments to zoom in on a particular folder. After that, it’s up to you to weed out the hard disk hogs: Click a folder in the left-hand list and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Move to Trash</strong></span> to delete it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0112"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 7: Creating and Extracting Compressed Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_7_colon_creating_and_extracting"/>Project 7: Creating and Extracting Compressed Files</h1></div></div></div><p>Since I have been talking about file storage, it seems only fitting to wrap up this chapter by teaching you how to create and extract compressed files. In the Windows world, these are generally referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>Zip files</em></span>, while in the Linux world, <span class="emphasis"><em>tarball</em></span> is the operative name. The Linux name, in case you’re wondering, comes from the application that is used to create the archive for such files, Tar. Compressed archives are great for two reasons: They let you bundle a load of files into one handy package, and they squeeze all the files down so that they take up less space on your hard disk. If you’ve ever tried to email a bunch of files to someone, you know how useful this can be.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0113"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0114"/></p><p>To get some of the hands-on stuff down, you’ll be creating a Windows/Linux/Mac-friendly Zip file and then extracting it. You can get down to business by opening a Nautilus window and creating a couple of dummy files to work with. Do this by going to the Nautilus <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Document</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Empty Document</strong></span>. A new file will appear in the Nautilus window, with its name highlighted. You can type a name for the file; I’m using <span class="emphasis"><em>dogwood</em></span>. Now repeat the process to create a second file; I’ll be calling that one <span class="emphasis"><em>violet</em></span>. Use something equally evocative for yours.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0115"/></p><p>Now that you have two files to work with, you can create the compressed archive by following these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select the two files either by clicking your mouse to the side of the files and then dragging the cursor (with the mouse button still pressed) over both files until they are highlighted or by holding down the <span class="keycap">ctrl</span> key and clicking each file individually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once both files are highlighted, right-click either one and select <span class="strong"><strong>Compress</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Compress window that appears, type <strong class="userinput"><code>blossoms</code></strong> in the Filename text box and then select <span class="strong"><strong>.zip</strong></span> from the drop-down menu button to the right of that. Once everything looks like what I’ve set up in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#creating_a_compressed_archive" title="Figure 7-22. Creating a compressed archive">Figure 7-22</a>, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button, after which a compressed archive of your two files (<span class="emphasis"><em>blossoms.zip</em></span>) will appear in your Home folder.</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_compressed_archive"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7675"/><img alt="Creating a compressed archive" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263620.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-22. Creating a compressed archive</p></div></li></ol></div><p>Now that you know how to put things together, let’s learn the equally simple task of ripping it all apart—well, okay, <span class="emphasis"><em>extracting</em></span> your files:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Drag the original <span class="emphasis"><em>dogwood</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>violet</em></span> files to the Trash to get them out of the way.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Double-click the <span class="emphasis"><em>blossoms.zip</em></span> file you’ve just created. A window showing the contents of the file will appear (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#extracting_a_compressed_archive" title="Figure 7-23. Extracting a compressed archive">Figure 7-23</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="extracting_a_compressed_archive"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7706"/><img alt="Extracting a compressed archive" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263622.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 7-23. Extracting a compressed archive</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>In that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Extract</strong></span> button, after which another window, Extract, will appear.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Extract</strong></span> button in that window, and within a second (two at the most), you will find two new copies of <span class="emphasis"><em>dogwood</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>violet</em></span> in your Home folder.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now you’ve created and extracted a compressed archive, which is in this case a Zip file. You can also create a compressed tarball in the future by following the same procedure (probably with real rather than dummy files), but when it’s time to select an archive type, select <span class="emphasis"><em>.tar.gz</em></span> instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>.zip</em></span>. Other than that single step, it is the same creation and extraction process.</p></div></div></body></html>
