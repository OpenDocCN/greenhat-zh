You can add <span class="emphasis"><em>launchers</em></span> (respectively known as <span class="emphasis"><em>program shortcuts</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>aliases</em></span> to Windows and Mac users), utilities, and even amusements to make it do almost anything you want—within limits, of course. In the various stages of this project, you will customize your panel to get some hands-on experience working with it and to make things more convenient for you as you make your way through the rest of this book. You are, of course, free to change any of the customizations I ask you to make (though you won't have a say in the matter if you're working in a live session from the Ubuntu Desktop CD, because you won't be able to save your settings).</p><p>Each of the following subprojects is very simple. Most are only three-step, point-and-click procedures that you should be able to handle without any difficulty.</p><div class="sect2" title="3A-1: Adding Utility Buttons to the Panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_adding_utility_buttons_to_the"/>3A-1: Adding Utility Buttons to the Panel</h2></div></div></div><p>The GNOME panel allows you to add a number of utility applications, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>applets</em></span>. Each of these has some specific function, such as tracking your stocks, telling you the weather, or performing some particular system-related function. To start, let's add a useful utility to the top panel: the Force Quit button. The Force Quit button lets you quickly and easily deal with non-responding windows.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0168" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0169" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0170" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0171" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0172" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0173" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Yes, it does happen on occasion: A window suddenly refuses to do anything. Regardless of what you want it to do or what it is supposed to be doing, it just sits there as if it is on strike (maybe it is). With just one click of the Force Quit button, your cursor becomes a powerful surgical instrument that will kill the window you click. You definitely don't want to be without this button, so here's how to add it to the panel:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click any open space on the top panel.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From the pop-up menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Panel</strong></span>, after which the Add to Panel window will appear.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In that window, scroll down, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Force Quit</strong></span> once to highlight it, as I've done in <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#adding_launchers_and_utility_applets_to" title="Figure 3-6. Adding launchers and utility applets to the panel">Figure 3-6</a>.

Once you start installing applications in Ubuntu, you will find that some of those applications do not automatically install program launchers in your Applications menu. This means that you have to open a Terminal window and type a command every time you want to run such programs, which can get old rather fast. The Run Application applet is one way around this problem.</p><p>To add the Run Application applet to the panel, just follow the same steps you used when adding the Force Quit button, but this time in Step 3, highlight <span class="strong"><strong>Run Application</strong></span> in the Add to Panel window instead of Force Quit.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you later decide not to keep the Run Application applet on the panel or if you just prefer keyboard shortcuts to pointing and clicking, it is worth noting that you can also open the applet by pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>alt</strong></span>-F2.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="3A-2: Adding Amusing Applets to the Panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-2_colon_adding_amusing_applets_to_the"/>3A-2: Adding Amusing Applets to the Panel</h2></div></div></div><p>The GNOME panel not only allows you to add very functional utilities, but it allows you to add quite seemingly useless amusements as well. In this part of the project, you will be adding two such amusements: Eyes and a little fish called Wanda.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0174" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0175" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0176" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0177" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0178" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0179" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0180" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0181" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0182" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0183" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0184" class="indexterm"/></p><p>At first glance, Wanda does little more than bat her tail around and spurt out a bubble or two. However, if you install a little application called Fortune via the Ubuntu Software Center, which you will learn how to use in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a>, and then click Wanda, a window pops up in which she will spew out quotes and offbeat one-liners.</p><p>To get a glimpse of Wanda in action, limited though that action may be, the steps are essentially the same as those in Project 3A-1, but I'll run through them one more time:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click any open space on the top panel.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From the pop-up menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Panel</strong></span>, after which the Add to Panel window will appear.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In that window, click <span class="strong"><strong>Fish</strong></span> once to highlight it, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>With Wanda now in place on your panel, you can add Eyes, which is a pair of eyes that follows your mouse cursor around as it moves around your desktop. Follow the same procedure, but click <span class="strong"><strong>Eyes</strong></span> instead of Fish in Step 3.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="3A-3: Adding a Program Launcher to the Panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-3_colon_adding_a_program_launcher_to_t"/>3A-3: Adding a Program Launcher to the Panel</h2></div></div></div><p>Now let's move on to something a bit more practical—adding program launchers to the panel.

These are System Monitor, which allows you to view your computer's running applications and processes, memory and CPU usage, and storage device usage; Terminal, in which you can type and execute commands (slightly geeky, I admit, but very useful); and the Ubuntu Software Center, which you can use to download and install applications.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0190" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0191" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0192" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0193" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0194" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0195" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0196" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Here's what you need to do:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click the <span class="strong"><strong>drawer</strong></span> applet in the panel, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Drawer</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Add to Drawer window that then appears (and looks and behaves the same as the Add to Panel window), select <span class="strong"><strong>Application Launcher</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Forward</strong></span> button that appears.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On the next screen, click the small + next to <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span>, scroll down and click <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> to select it, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button.

It may seem a little messy up there right now, so let's do a bit of housekeeping by moving things around. You will try to group things together somewhat thematically so as to make them easier to deal with.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0203" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0204" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Fortunately, you can move panel launchers quite easily by right-clicking the launcher in question, selecting Move from the pop-up menu, and then dragging the launcher to the spot you want to place it. Once the launcher is where you want it to be, click the launcher once, and it will stay there.</p><p>To get some practice with this moving business, let's move the launchers, menus, and drawers you added by placing them in the following order, from left to right: Applications, Places, System, Firefox, Help, OpenOffice.org Writer, OpenOffice.org Calc, Sound &amp; Video, Games, Drawer. Place the remaining launchers toward the right end of the panel, to the left of the Network Manager applet or any others that appear their automatically, in the following left-to-right order: Eyes, Wanda (Fish), Force Quit. Finally, place the Run Application applet by itself, midway between the two clusters of launchers. When you've made all your changes, your panel should look pretty much like mine in <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#the_gnome_panel_with_the_new_launchers" title="Figure 3-13. The GNOME panel with the new launchers">Figure 3-13</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_gnome_panel_with_the_new_launchers"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e3144"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656160.png.jpg" alt="The GNOME panel with the new launchers"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-13. The GNOME panel with the new launchers</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="More Panel Fun"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="more_panel_fun"/>More Panel Fun</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to the basic customization you did in Project 3A, you can do a lot more to change the look and feel of your panel. Of course, you can remove any of your launchers, drawers, or menus by right-clicking the item in question and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Remove From Panel</strong></span> in the pop-up menu, but there are still more options. Most of these are available by right-clicking any open space in the panel and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>, which will open the Panel Properties window.</p><p>From this window you can change the position of the panel, alter its size, change its color, or make it transparent—very cool. You can also set the panel so that it will automatically disappear when you are not using it and have it reappear when you bring your mouse cursor into the area where the panel normally resides. Don't feel afraid to play around—that's half the fun!</p></div></div>

A very nice feature of GNOME is that it allows you to edit its menus. You can add launchers, remove items, move items, and even change the icons that appear within the menus. All in all, you have a lot of control over things, but for this project, you'll limit the work to two of these areas: changing icons and moving menu items.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0205" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0206" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0207" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0208" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="3B-1: Changing Icons Within Menus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_changing_icons_within_menus"/>3B-1: Changing Icons Within Menus</h2></div></div></div><p>As you no doubt recall, one of the problems with the OpenOffice.org Writer and Calc launchers you added to the panel was that they shared rather similar icons. If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span>, you will see that the icons for the various OpenOffice.org modules, although not the same, are also a bit similar. To remedy this state of affairs, you will change these icons to the same set you used for the two panel launchers in Project 3A-4. In this case, just follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Menus</strong></span>, or go to the <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Main Menu</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the menu editor window that then appears (<a class="xref" href="ch03s05.html#customizing_your_menus" title="Figure 3-14. Customizing your menus">Figure 3-14</a>), click <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> in the left pane.

If you agree and want to hide this instance of Evolution, just uncheck the box next to its name. The name of that entry should then switch to italic typeface, indicating that the item in question will not be visible in the actual drop-down menu.

<div class="sect1" title="Virtual Desktops"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual_desktops"/>Virtual Desktops</h1></div></div></div><p>It is now time to discuss a rather convenient feature of Linux: <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual desktops</em></span>. Although the virtual desktop feature has only recently made its way into other operating systems, it has been a Linux feature for years (yes, it started here, folks). But rather than babble on about what this virtual desktop business is and what it can do for you, it is probably best to have you learn about it by giving you some hands-on experience.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0212" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0213" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In your GNOME panel, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Wanda (Fish)</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>OpenOffice.org Writer</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Firefox</strong></span> launchers. You will then have three windows open in your present desktop, or <span class="emphasis"><em>workspace</em></span>. Now look at the Workspace Switcher to the right of the bottom panel. There should be four boxes, with the one on the left (your present workspace) in light gray. If you click the box next to that, now in dark gray, all your open windows will suddenly disappear.</p><p>Actually, nothing has really disappeared—you are just viewing a new desktop. All your other windows are still open and running in the previous desktop. In this second desktop, you can open something else: Select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Games</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>AisleRiot Solitaire</strong></span>. The AisleRiot Solitaire card game will soon appear.</p><p>You now have windows open in two different desktops, and you can switch back and forth between them. To do so, just go to the Workspace Switcher in your panel, and click the now gray left box, which will take you to your original desktop. Once you've done that, the box for the workspace you were just in will turn dark gray, and you can then click that one to go back to your game desktop.</p><p>As you can imagine, this feature has some potential benefits for you, in addition to helping you avoid clutter. Just imagine that you are at work typing some long document in OpenOffice.org Writer. Eventually, you get tired and decide to goof off a bit by playing a game, such as Mines, for a while. To do this, you switch to another desktop where you open and play the game. A bit later, when you notice your boss making the rounds of the office, you simply switch back to the first desktop so that you look busy when he walks by and asks, "Keeping yourself busy, Boaz?"</p><p>Phew!</p><p>By the way, you can also switch between virtual desktops by simultaneously pressing and holding <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>alt</strong></span> and then pressing your left and right arrow keys to move to your targeted desktop.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0214" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So, what happens if, let's say, you are running OpenOffice.org Writer in one workspace and the GIMP in another but suddenly think that it would be handy to have them both running in the same workspace? Do you quit the GIMP and start it up again in the other desktop? Fortunately, things are much simpler than that, and there are actually two ways to get the job done.</p><p>The first of these ways is to right-click the title bar of the window you want to move, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Move to Workspace Left</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Move to Workspace Right</strong></span>. You can also select Move to Another Workspace and then select the workspace you want to move the window to by number: Workspace 1, Workspace 2, Workspace 3, and so on.</p><p>If you prefer keeping your hands more on your keyboard than on your mouse, you can also move a window from workspace to workspace by using hotkeys. With the window you want to move active (on top of the pile, so to speak), press and hold <span class="keycap"><strong>shift</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-<span class="keycap"><strong>alt</strong></span>, and then use the left and right cursor keys to move the window to the desired desktop</p></div>

Knowing what you now do about Wanda the fish, you might find it odd for me to start talking about her again, but Wanda has a few more tricks beneath her fins. In fact, she is a good means by which to introduce two of GNOME's most famous Easter eggs. <span class="emphasis"><em>Easter eggs</em></span>, in case you don't know, are hidden snippets of code that programmers seem to love to sneak into their programs. They are usually pretty useless things, but they can be found in all operating systems, numerous applications, and even on DVDs (to find out more about those, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/">http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/</a>). A good example of an Easter egg is my first encounter with one on my first Mac, an ancient Mac SE with a whopping 2MB of RAM. On that machine, you could bring up an image (or was it a slide show?) of the Mac SE development team by pressing the seldom used debug key on the side of the machine and then typing <strong class="userinput"><code>G 41D89A</code></strong>. Pretty cool, I guess, but I would never ever have stumbled upon it had I not read about it in some magazine.<a id="IDX-CHP-3-0215" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0216" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0217" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0218" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0219" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0220" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0221" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0222" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0223" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-3-0224" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As my example shows, accessing these Easter eggs usually requires some unusual maneuvers, ones that you would never perform in the normal course of things. To see a Wanda-related Easter egg in action, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Run Application</strong></span> button you just added to the panel, type <strong class="userinput"><code>gegls from outer space</code></strong> in the Command box, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span>. You will then see an odd little game of the Space Invaders genre, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s07.html#one_of_gnome_apostrophy_s_wanda-relate" title="Figure 3-16. One of GNOME's Wanda-related Easter eggs">Figure 3-16</a>, in which Wanda defends our beloved planet from . . . well, gegls, I guess.</p><div class="figure"><a id="one_of_gnome_apostrophy_s_wanda-relate"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e3530"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656166.png.jpg" alt="One of GNOME's Wanda-related Easter eggs"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 3-16. One of GNOME's Wanda-related Easter eggs</p></div><p>To try the other Wanda Easter egg, open the Run Application panel applet again, but this time type <strong class="userinput"><code>free the fish</code></strong>, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span>. Wanda will now appear swimming around your desktop. If you then click her, she will swim away and out of the picture . . . but she'll be back.</p><p>To put an end to Wanda's comings and goings, you will need to restart the GNOME panel. There several rather inelegant ways of going about this, but for now you can do it by opening the Run Application panel applet again, typing <strong class="userinput"><code>killall gnome-panel</code></strong>, and then clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span>.

A menu (<a class="xref" href="ch03s08.html#gnome_apostrophy_s_session_menu_options" title="Figure 3-17. GNOME's session menu options">Figure 3-17</a>) will appear with eight choices to choose from: Lock Screen, Guest Session, Switch from rg (whatever your username happens to be), Log Out, Suspend, Hibernate, Restart, and Shut Down.
