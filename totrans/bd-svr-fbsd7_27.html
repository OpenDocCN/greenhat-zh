<p class="docText1"><a name="BIND " class="calibre8" id="BIND "/>BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is the most widely used DNS server application on the Internet. Slightly over 79 percent of DNS servers use BIND DNS, according to a survey conducted by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) in July 2007. Microsoft came in second at 16 percent.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="calibre2" href="#CHP-10-1">[]</a></sup><a name="name system" class="calibre8" id="name system"/> The domain name system is responsible for the conversion of domain names, such as <a class="calibre2" target="_blank" href="http://unorthodocs.net">http://unorthodocs.net</a><a name="like " class="calibre8" id="like "/>, into routable IP addresses like 69.226.238.99. It is considered one of the most critical components of the Internet.</p><blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre37"><a name="CHP-10-1" class="calibre8" id="CHP-10-1">[]</a></sup><a name="of the" class="calibre8" id="of the"/> See the results of the Internet Systems Consortium's ongoing survey at <a class="calibre2" target="_blank" href="http://www.isc.org/ds">http://www.isc.org/ds</a>.<a name="IDX-CHP-10-0162" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0162"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0163" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0163"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0164" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0164"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0165" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0165"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0166" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0166"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0167" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0167"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0168" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0168"/><a name="IDX-CHP-10-0169" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0169"/></p></blockquote>
<p class="docText1"><a name="that addressed" class="calibre8" id="that addressed"/>BIND version 9 was a total rewrite of the BIND package that addressed architectural issues and known security problems in previous versions. New features in BIND 9 include DNS Security (DNSSEC), multiprocessor support, support for IPv6, protocol enhancements, and better portability.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="DNS updates" class="calibre8" id="DNS updates"/>BIND also supports dynamic DNS updates (as per RFC 2136). When coupled with the Internet Systems Consortium's DHCP server, dynamic DNS allows real-time updates to the DNS server's zone files as DHCP clients join the network. This gives DHCP clients the luxury of having a locally or publicly resolvable hostname.<a name="IDX-CHP-10-0170" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0170"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="student project" class="calibre8" id="student project"/>BIND was originally conceived as a graduate student project at the University of California, Berkeley in the early '80s. UC Berkeley worked on BIND in cooperation with Digital Equipment Corporation for a few years. Paul Vixie, of Digital Equipment Corporation, later became principal programmer of the BIND project. BIND was passed on to the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), a nonprofit corporation led by Vixie, who now continues to develop the BIND system independently.<a name="IDX-CHP-10-0171" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-10-0171"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="authoritative name" class="calibre8" id="authoritative name"/>We'll be building a local master authoritative name server for your domain name. This will also provide the benefits of a caching name server. A <span class="docEmphasis1">caching name server</span><a name="files of" class="calibre8" id="files of"/> is basically a DNS relay: It has no zone files of its own and must get DNS information from other DNS servers (also called <span class="docEmphasis1">forwarders</span><a name="DNS queries" class="calibre8" id="DNS queries"/>). Both authoritative and caching name servers store DNS queries in a cache to make subsequent requests faster.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="A master" class="calibre8" id="A master"/>A master authoritative name server also has a zone file (a list of known IP addresses) for your domain. When a DNS query is received for your domain, BIND looks at your zone file and returns the requested information. If the query is for a domain other than yours, the query is forwarded to other DNS servers specified in your forwarder's configuration.</p>
