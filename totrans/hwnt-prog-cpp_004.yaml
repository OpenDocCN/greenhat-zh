    I had taken my own test, I would have missed this question. So I had to get up
    in front of everybody and tell them, "There are two ways of getting full credit
    for problem #1\. The first way is to give the correct answer; the other way is
    to give the answer I thought was correct.'

- en: A church had just bought its first computer, and the staff was learning how
    to use it. The church secretary decided to set up a form letter to be used in
    a funeral service. Where the person's name was to be she put in the word "<name>".
    When a funeral occurred she would change this word to the actual name of the departed.

- en: One day, there were two funerals, first for a lady named Mary, then later one
    for someone named Edna. So the secretary used global replace to change "<name>"
    to "Mary." So far so good. Next she generated the service for the second funeral
    by changing the word "Mary" to "Edna." That was a mistake.
