- en: Every time a person edits a Wikipedia article, he or she can add a line of text
    that summarizes the edit in the Edit summary box that is provided underneath the
    edit window. Wikipedia has no formal etiquette governing the content of edit summaries,
    but a vast body of jargon has developed over the years. This jargon is useful
    because it makes describing common types of edits easy, but the jargon can also
    be daunting to readers who are unfamiliar with it. This cheat sheet lists common
    edit summary terms and explains their meanings.

    This Page tab directly. These edits are treated just the same as any other edit
    and show up normally in the article's revision history. When edits are made using
    nonstandard means, however, the edit summary is often filled in automatically

    make repetitive edits (such as correcting spelling) or quickly revert vandalism.

    even more highly repetitive tasks.
