    and receive files through the network between any pair of computers or other connected
    devices. But when a connection fails, or one of your users can't find a network
    node, or any of a truly amazing number of other possible problems occurs, as the
    local network expert, it's your job is to fix it. Network problems always have
    a specific cause (or combination of causes), even if that cause is not obvious.

    that computers and networks don't break down completely at random. Every piece
    of information you can find about a problem can help you isolate and solve it.
    Is the problem a failure to connect to a particular computer through the network,
    or an error message, or a file transfer that takes longer than usual? Is it limited
    to a single computer, or does it appear all over the network? Have any of the
    lights on your network router, switch, or modem changed color or gone dark? Does
    the problem occur when you are using a particular program or only when a certain
    desk lamp (or vacuum cleaner or any other electrical device) is turned on? As
    you identify symptoms, make a list—either on paper or in your mind.
  prefs: []

- en: If you see an error message, copy the exact text onto a piece of paper. You
    might have to restart the computer or go to another computer to search for information,
    and you will need the specific wording of the message. Don't ignore the cryptic
    code numbers or other apparently unintelligible information. Even if the message
    means nothing to you, it could be the key to finding the help you need.

    If everybody has trouble connecting to the Internet during a rainstorm, maybe

    problem is occurring. Although it's easy (and often appropriate) to think about
    a network as an amorphous cloud that exists everywhere at the same time, when
    you're looking for a specific point of failure, you must replace that cloud with
    a detailed map that shows every component and connection. If you don't already
    have a network diagram in your files, consider drawing one now.

    by replacing individual components and cables one at a time until the problem
    goes away. If the problem disappears when you install a replacement, that's a
    good indication that the original part was the source of the problem. If the replacement
    is a relatively expensive item like a router or a printer, you might want to send
    it back to the manufacturer for replacement or repair, especially if it's under
    warranty. But if you replace a cheap part like a cable or a network interface
    card, it's often easier to just throw it away and buy a new one.

    shutting down each program running on that computer, one at a time, and then try
    to reestablish the connection. If you recently installed a new program, driver,
    or update, try uninstalling the new software and test the connection again. If
    the connection works, the conflict is between the new software and your network
    connection or device driver. In Windows, try restarting the computer in Safe Mode
    and re-establishing the connection; if it works in Safe Mode, you know that the
    Windows operating system is not the source of the problem.

    "Figure 17-2. Network Magic scans your LAN and displays all the devices connected

    the existing network configuration. It can also perform some basic troubleshooting
    tests and automatic repairs.

    and search for *Network Monitor*) and Wireshark ([http://www.wireshark.org/](http://www.wireshark.org/))
    are free protocol analyzers that capture and display data as it moves through
    your network. In other words, they grab each block of data (a *frame*) as it passes
    in or out of your computer, and they display the contents of the frame along with
    detailed information about the form and structure of each frame. [Figure 17-3](ch17s06.html#microsoft_network_monitor_displays_deta
    "Figure 17-3. Microsoft Network Monitor displays detailed information about network

    "Figure 17-4. Wireshark uses contrasting colors to show different kinds of data
    frames.") shows a Wireshark screen. The two programs capture the same data stream,
    but they handle and display it differently. The programs are available at no cost,
    so you might want to install both of them. Protocol analyzers are also known as
    *network sniffers*.

    the actual text of messages, conversations, and other transactions, along with
    all the commands and status messages that move through the network. Most of the
    time, you can allow your computer and the network plumbing to handle the data
    in background. But when something goes wrong, the data captured by a protocol
    analyzer can help you identify what's causing the problem.

- en: For example, if the amount of incoming or outgoing traffic moving through your
    network increases, the network may be sending or receiving many requests every
    second. This could be a hacker's denial of service attack, or a computer that
    has innocently latched itself into an endless program loop. Either way, you will
    want to identify the source and take action to make it stop. When this happened
    to me, I used Wireshark to find the numeric IP address of the computer that was
    originating the bogus messages and a whois program to identify that computer's
    owner; then I sent an email explaining the problem and asking them to fix it.
    The data stream stopped within an hour.

    infected or has some other problem that interferes with proper operation. By running
    the sniffer program on more than one computer, or even inserting a sniffer at
    a router, a modem connection, or other interface point, you can often isolate
    the source of a problem.

    it's a complex and tedious process. But when you need to know what's moving through
    your network, an analyzer can give you information that you won't find anywhere
    else.

- en: As a formal or informal network manager, you're often on your own when you're
    trying to find and fix a problem on your LAN, but if you or one of your users
    discovers a problem using the Internet, you might need help from your Internet
    service provider's (ISP's) support center and the people who run the computer
    or network at the other end of your connection.

    of the ISP's help desk and the network tech center at the telephone company, cable
    TV service, or other company that provides the physical connection between your
    own LAN and your ISP. The people who answer calls in those support centers are
    there to help you, and they will often have tools that can test and monitor your
    network connection. When you talk to a support representative, ask for the case
    number or trouble ticket number that they have assigned to your problem; if you
    have to call back later, the case number will lead the person who takes your call
    to the notes about earlier calls.

    a logical and organized approach to finding the cause of a network problem, you
    will probably solve the problem without developing (or enlarging) an ulcer. Over
    time, you will recognize particular symptoms and know how to home in on the most
    effective diagnostic tools and techniques.

    minutes. Make yourself a sandwich, have a cup of coffee or a glass of lemonade,
    or go for a short walk. The network will still be there when you get back, and
    you'll feel better about it. Approaching the problem with a fresh mind can often
    be the most effective possible way to solve it.
