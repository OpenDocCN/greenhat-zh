    black boxes that you can turn on and use without knowing much about the way they
    work. That's the way most people relate to the technology that surrounds them.
    You shouldn't have to worry about the technical specifications just to place a
    long-distance telephone call or heat your lunch in a microwave oven or connect
    your laptop computer to a network. In an ideal world (ha!), the wireless link

    identified by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864\. Without going into the math, Maxwell's
    equations show that a changing magnetic field will produce an electric field,
    and a changing electric field will produce a magnetic field. When alternating
    current (AC) moves through a wire or other physical conductor, some of that energy
    escapes into the surrounding space as an alternating magnetic field. That magnetic
    field creates an alternating electric field in space, which in turn creates another
    magnetic field and so forth until the original current is interrupted.

    radiation of electromagnetic energy through space. A device that produces radio
    waves is called a *transmitter*, and a complementary device that detects radio
    waves in the air and converts them to some other form of energy is called a *receiver*.
    Both transmitters and receivers use specially shaped devices called *antennas*
    to focus the radio signal in a particular direction, or *pattern*, and to increase
    the amount of effective radiation (from a transmitter) or sensitivity (in a receiver).

    users. For example, an FM radio station might be licensed to operate at 92.1 MHz
    at a certain geographical location. Nobody else is allowed to use that frequency
    in close enough proximity to interfere with that signal. On the other hand, some

    signals that use a single narrow channel. Spread spectrum is extremely efficient,
    so the radio transmitters can operate with very low power. Because the signals
    operate on a relatively wide band of frequencies, they are less sensitive to interference
    from other radio signals and electrical noise, which means they can often get
    through in environments where a conventional narrow-band signal would be impossible
    to receive and understand. And because a frequency-hopping spread spectrum signal
    shifts among more than one channel, it can be extremely difficult for an unauthorized
    listener to intercept and decode the contents of a signal.

    signal that changes frequency many times per second. Additional transmitter and
    receiver pairs can use different hopping patterns on the same set of subchannels
    at the same time. At any point in time, each transmission is probably using a
    different subchannel, so there's no interference between signals. When a conflict

    networks uses an 11-chip Barker Sequence to spread the radio signal through a
    single 22 MHz–wide channel without changing frequencies. Each DSSS link uses just
    one channel without any hopping between frequencies. As [Figure 2-5](ch02.html#a_conventional_signal_left_uses_a_narrow

    A DSSS signal (right) uses a wider bandwidth but a less powerful signal.") shows,
    a DSSS transmission uses more bandwidth, but less power than a conventional signal.
    The digital signal on the left is a conventional transmission in which the power
    is concentrated within a tight bandwidth. The DSSS signal on the right uses the
    same amount of power, but it spreads that power across a wider band of radio frequencies.

    signal, and because each bit is divided into several chips, the receiver can usually
    identify noise and reject it before it decodes the signal.

    network is 11Mbps, but when the signal quality won't support that speed, the transmitter
    and receiver use a process called *dynamic rate shifting* to drop the speed down
    to 5.5Mbps. The speed might drop because a source of electrical noise near the
    receiver interferes with the signal or because the transmitter and receiver are
    too far apart to support full-speed operation. If 5.5Mbps is still too fast for
    the link to handle, it drops again, down to 2Mbps or even 1Mbps.

    set of standards and specifications for wireless networks under the title *IEEE
    802.11* that define the formats and structures of the relatively short-range signals
    that provide Wi-Fi service. The original 802.11 standard (without any letter at
    the end) was released in 1997\. It covers several types of wireless media: two
    kinds of radio transmissions and networks that use infrared light. The 802.11b
    standard provides additional specifications for wireless Ethernet networks. A
    related document, IEEE 802.11a, describes wireless networks that operate at higher
    speeds on different radio frequencies. Still other 802.11 radio networking standards
    with other letters are also available or moving toward public release.'

    the de facto standards used by just about every wireless Ethernet LAN that you
    are likely to encounter in offices and public spaces and in most home networks.
    It's worth the trouble to keep an eye on the progress of those other standards,
    but for the moment, 802.11a and 802.11g are the ones to use for short-range wireless
    networks, especially if you're expecting to connect to networks where you don't
    control all the hardware yourself.

    more reliable. The older standards will still work, so new Wi-Fi equipment will
    support all three (often along with 802.11a, which uses different radio frequencies)
    and automatically match your network interface to the signals it detects from

    them are limited to about 100 feet (35 meters) indoors or up to 300 feet (100
    meters) outdoors, assuming there are no obstructions between the access point

    on the third generation of cellular telephone technology. If you have been using
    a mobile telephone for more than a year or two, you probably remember that the
    earliest phones were only good for voice calls, but as each new generation was
    introduced, your mobile carrier offered more and better features. [Table 2-2](ch02s03.html#cellular_mobile_telephone_generations

    new location, and you can even keep the same connection alive in a moving vehicle.
    Each of the major wireless broadband services offers coverage in most metropolitan
    areas and much of the countryside between cities.
