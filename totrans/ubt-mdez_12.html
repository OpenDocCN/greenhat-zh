That being the case, many users want to know what office-related applications are available for their system.</p><p>Fortunately, Linux can get down to business as well as the next OS. More importantly, since there are so many applications freely available for you to try, you might find that you actually end up using far more office-related productivity apps than you would if you had to pay for everything up front. In this chapter, I’ll walk you through the offerings that come bundled with Ubuntu and then point you to yet others you might want to consider adding to your collection.</p><div class="sect1" title="Where the Apps Are"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_the_apps_are"/>Where the Apps Are</h1></div></div></div><p>The majority of apps in this chapter can be run from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> filter button. Exceptions are noted in the relevant sections. As with all applications, you can also run an app by typing its name in the Dash’s search box and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0003"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="LibreOffice"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="libreoffice"/>LibreOffice</h1></div></div></div><p>When it comes to work, most people turn to office suites, which contain the apps they use most often—a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation editor. The de facto standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in both the Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, because it is a Microsoft product, you can be relatively sure that no Linux version is (or ever will be) available.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0004"/></p><p>Fortunately, Linux has an exceedingly capable office suite, and it comes bundled with Ubuntu. The suite is called LibreOffice, and it is the open source community-supported descendant of OpenOffice.org, the office suite originally bundled with most Linux distros until it was taken over and later jettisoned by Oracle (a bit of recent history there in case you wondered). LibreOffice is not some lightweight sour-grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office-less Linux world; it is a full-featured contender. LibreOffice, incidentally, is also freely available (as in <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>) in Windows and Mac OS X versions.</p><div class="sect2" title="LibreOffice Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="libreoffice_applications"/>LibreOffice Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>The entire LibreOffice office suite consists of a number of application modules, all but one of which come bundled with Ubuntu. These include a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation creator and player (Impress), and a very handy vector-drawing program (Draw). You can find all of these by going to the Dash, clicking the Applications lens, and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> filter button. A database module (Base) is also available for LibreOffice as a separate download via Ubuntu Software Center (just search for <span class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span>).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0006"/></p><p>Since giving full and detailed instructions on how to use each of these applications would take up an entire book (and there are entire books on the subject), I will simply introduce each module to you. There is help, should you need it, in the LibreOffice Help system (<span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>LibreOffice Help</strong></span>) and online at <a class="ulink" href="http://libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/">http://libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/</a>. There are also numerous video tutorials available on YouTube.</p><div class="sect3" title="Writer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="writer"/>Writer</h3></div></div></div><p>As I mentioned earlier, the word processor is the office application that the majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, LibreOffice Writer is a good one (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#libreoffice_writer" title="Figure 12-1. LibreOffice Writer">Figure 12-1</a>). It is chock-full of features and can read and save Microsoft Word files. Like Word, it will even let you save your documents as HTML files so that you can easily change your documents into web pages. In terms of usage, Writer is a very straightforward word processor, so I won’t go into any more detail here. Again, check out LibreOffice Help or the online documentation mentioned in the previous section if you require more information.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0010"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="libreoffice_writer"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14277"/><img alt="LibreOffice Writer" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263772.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-1. LibreOffice Writer</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Calc"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="calc"/>Calc</h3></div></div></div><p>Calc is the LibreOffice spreadsheet application, and it is similar to Excel in terms of capabilities and general layout (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#a_graph_created_in_libreoffice_calc" title="Figure 12-2. A graph created in LibreOffice Calc">Figure 12-2</a>). It can also, quite importantly, read and save Microsoft Excel files.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_graph_created_in_libreoffice_calc"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14292"/><img alt="A graph created in LibreOffice Calc" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263774.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-2. A graph created in LibreOffice Calc</p></div><p>Since most people who use spreadsheets generally understand what they are all about and, after a bit of poking around, can figure out how to use them, I won’t take up your time here with any sort of primer about using Calc. However, because many others don’t see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will mention a few of the simpler tasks that can be done with Calc in the hope of enticing some of you into trying it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0013"/></p><p>Many people who don’t use spreadsheets think of them as giant calculators used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, such as payrolls. That view is not incorrect, of course, since that was the original purpose of such applications, but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too. Projecting household budgets, calculating grade point averages (by teachers or students), figuring out how long it will take you to save up for your trip to San Marino, or even tracking prices for the four or five guitars you are trying to choose among . . . these are all tasks that spreadsheets are made for. What’s even nicer is that when doing any of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs to make abstract numbers show themselves to you visually.</p><p>If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating lists of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, and address lists. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order, sort them by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to find a use for Calc, so don’t ignore it entirely.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Impress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="impress"/>Impress</h3></div></div></div><p>Impress (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#libreoffice_impress" title="Figure 12-3. LibreOffice Impress">Figure 12-3</a>) is LibreOffice’s answer to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, with which it is compatible. It allows you to create attractive slides for use in presentations and allows you to create notes or handouts to accompany the slides. Although these features make Impress quite handy in business and education settings, you may not find as much value in it as a home user.</p><div class="figure"><a id="libreoffice_impress"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14324"/><img alt="LibreOffice Impress" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263776.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-3. LibreOffice Impress</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Draw"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="draw"/>Draw</h3></div></div></div><p>More useful to the home user is LibreOffice Draw, which just happens to be my favorite and, next to Writer, most frequently utilized LibreOffice module. Although Draw isn’t great for creating true graphics in the artistic sense, it is very useful for creating flowcharts; organizational diagrams (such as seating arrangements for wedding receptions or conferences); or any other document in which you want a bit more control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the two are combined), such as fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this sense, Draw can be used quite effectively as a simple page layout program, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#a_newsletter_created_open_parenthesis_an" title="Figure 12-4. A newsletter created (and displayed) in LibreOffice Draw">Figure 12-4</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0021"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_newsletter_created_open_parenthesis_an"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14373"/><img alt="A newsletter created (and displayed) in LibreOffice Draw" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263778.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-4. A newsletter created (and displayed) in LibreOffice Draw</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Microsoft Office and LibreOffice File Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="microsoft_office_and_libreoffice_file_co"/>Microsoft Office and LibreOffice File Compatibility</h2></div></div></div><p>Although I mention the point throughout this section, it is worthwhile to reemphasize that LibreOffice can read and write Microsoft Office files. This compatibility is quite good, though tables sometimes prove slightly problematic.</p><p>To read Microsoft Office files, all you need to do is double-click the file in question, and it will open in the appropriate LibreOffice module. When saving files within LibreOffice for use in earlier versions of Microsoft Office, however, you must save them into the appropriate format. Otherwise, LibreOffice will by default save files into its native format (<span class="emphasis"><em>.odt</em></span> for Writer documents, <span class="emphasis"><em>.ods</em></span> for Calc documents, and <span class="emphasis"><em>.odp</em></span> for Impress documents), and only the most recent versions of Microsoft Office can deal with these files.</p><p>To save a file in the format you will need, click the words <span class="strong"><strong>File type</strong></span> near the bottom left of the Save window and select the appropriate Microsoft Office format from the list of available file formats that appears below—choose <span class="strong"><strong>Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP/2003</strong></span> for a Writer document, for example.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="LibreOffice Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="libreoffice_features"/>LibreOffice Features</h2></div></div></div><p>The three main applications in LibreOffice (Writer, Calc, and Impress) are quite similar to their pre-Office 2007 equivalents in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), so switching to the LibreOffice applications should be relatively easy if you grew up with those versions of Microsoft Office.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0022"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0024"/></p><p>If you don’t have any experience with Microsoft Office, you should still find using LibreOffice applications straightforward because the basic layout is pretty intuitive. And if you are lacking in the intuition department, the built-in Help files are pretty good, too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just like tool tips in the Windows and Mac worlds. (In case you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, <span class="emphasis"><em>tool tips</em></span> are those little boxes that pop up to tell you what a button or menu item does when you place your mouse over that button or menu item.) Another cool and useful help feature is What’s This, which works like the Tips system but provides more detailed explanations of what a particular button does. If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>What’s This</strong></span>, your cursor will turn into a little question mark. Move that question mark cursor over almost any item in the LibreOffice interface, and you’ll find out what it does rather than just what the item is called.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0025"/></p><p>Despite all the straightforwardness I am speaking of, a few interface items will most likely be unfamiliar to you, so I will briefly discuss them. I’ll be using the word processor, Writer, as I describe these things, so you can run Writer while following along to make things easier.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting to Know the Buttons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_to_know_the_buttons"/>Getting to Know the Buttons</h2></div></div></div><p>Although you should be able to figure out what most of the buttons on the LibreOffice toolbars do, a few buttons, common to all LibreOffice modules, might deserve a bit more explanation.</p><div class="sect3" title="Export to PDF"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="export_to_pdf"/>Export to PDF</h3></div></div></div><p>The Export to PDF button is situated to the left of the two printer buttons (Print and Page Preview). You can use this button to <span class="emphasis"><em>export</em></span>, or save, your document as a PDF file.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Hyperlink"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="hyperlink"/>Hyperlink</h3></div></div></div><p>Clicking the Hyperlink button, the button to the left of the Table button, opens the Hyperlink window, from which you can assign links to specified documents—not only to web pages but also to documents on an individual computer and even targets within that document. Although a hyperlink on a web page is something we have all come to take for granted, the idea of hyperlinking between text documents sounds a little radical. It has, in fact, been around since before you or I even heard of the Internet.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Navigator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="navigator"/>Navigator</h3></div></div></div><p>The fourth to the last button in the top row (the one that looks like a starburst) is the Navigator button. Clicking this button (or just pressing the F5 key) opens the Navigator window (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_navigator_window" title="Figure 12-5. The Navigator window">Figure 12-5</a>), a pretty cool navigational feature that comes in handy when you are working with lengthy or otherwise complex documents.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0027"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_navigator_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14478"/><img alt="The Navigator window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263780.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-5. The Navigator window</p></div><p>The Navigator allows you to bounce back and forth easily between pages in a document or even between elements therein, such as sections, links, and so on. Let’s say you have a document with lots of illustrations in it (like this chapter), and you want to jump directly from graphic to graphic. In this case, you would double-click the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Graphics</em></span> in the main pane of the Navigator window and then click the jump buttons (the odd little buttons to the left of the page number selector) to begin jumping.</p><p>If you are dealing with a document containing various heading levels, such as all of the chapters in this book, you can also use Navigator to switch among those levels. Say you’ve decided to add a new main heading at the last minute to a document you’ve been writing. You thus need to drop all of the headings you had before down a notch, with the former main heading becoming a subheading and so on. When you double-click the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Headings</em></span>, the text of all the headings you have listed in the document appears. You can then select a heading in that list and click the Demote Level button (that’s the one at the far right of the second row of buttons) to move it down a level.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Gallery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gallery"/>Gallery</h3></div></div></div><p>To the right of the Navigator button is the Gallery button. By clicking this button, you cause the Gallery, a library of graphical elements for use in your documents or web pages, to appear in a separate pane at the top of your document window (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_gallery" title="Figure 12-6. The Gallery">Figure 12-6</a>). The elements within the Gallery range from various types of lines to buttons to colored three-dimensional doughnuts, and you can add items of your own.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_gallery"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14503"/><img alt="The Gallery" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263782.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-6. The Gallery</p></div><p>Inserting a graphic into your document is a simple enough task even when not using the Gallery. Just select <span class="strong"><strong>Insert</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Picture</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>From File</strong></span> and then locate the image file you want to insert. It can be handier to use the Gallery, however, when you intend to use certain graphics frequently. Once in the Gallery, your graphics are always only a click or two away and can be conveniently viewed in the Gallery browser window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0029"/></p><p>The collection of artwork that comes with LibreOffice is mostly geared toward building web pages, but other clip art is available elsewhere. For example, you can find a great collection online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openclipart.org/">http://www.openclipart.org/</a>. Everything there is in the public domain, so it is all free to use. Be sure to check out the “Game baddie” collection—it’s one of my favorites.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0030"/></p><p>Adding these (or any other) graphic files to the Gallery is relatively easy. First create a new category (called a <span class="emphasis"><em>theme</em></span>) for each group of images you want to add. To create a Gallery theme of your own, click the <span class="strong"><strong>New Theme</strong></span> button in the Gallery window. This will open the Properties of New Theme window, where you should give your theme a name. Once you’ve done that, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> tab and then the <span class="strong"><strong>Find Files</strong></span> button, which will open the Select Path window. From there, you can navigate to the folder in which you are storing your clip art, photos, or other graphics. Once you have found the folder, click the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button, after which a list of all the files in that folder will appear in the Properties of New Theme window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0031"/></p><p>From this window, you can easily add images to your new Gallery theme by clicking the name of each image you want to add and then clicking the Add button. (You might want to make sure that the box next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Preview</em></span> is checked to make things a bit easier.) Once you have done that, a copy of the image will immediately appear in the Gallery browser in your theme, where it will remain for future use (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#viewing_clip_art_and_your_own_collection" title="Figure 12-7. Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery">Figure 12-7</a>). When you are done adding images to your new theme, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. The Properties of New Theme window will close, revealing your new theme and its contents. To use one of the images in the Gallery, just right-click the image you want to insert into your document, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Insert</strong></span>, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Link</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_clip_art_and_your_own_collection"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14582"/><img alt="Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263784.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-7. Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Styles and Formatting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="styles_and_formatting"/>Styles and Formatting</h3></div></div></div><p>The final stop on our tour through LibreOffice’s unfamiliar buttons is the Styles and Formatting button, which is located at the far left side of the second row of buttons. This button acts as a toggle for the Styles and Formatting window (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_styles_and_formatting_window" title="Figure 12-8. The Styles and Formatting window">Figure 12-8</a>), from which you can select and then apply styles to any of the various elements within your document. Oh, and if you just can’t take your hands off the keyboard for a moment to fiddle with the mouse, you can also open the window by pressing the F11 key.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0033"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_styles_and_formatting_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14605"/><img alt="The Styles and Formatting window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263786.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-8. The Styles and Formatting window</p></div><p>To give you an example of how convenient using styles can be, imagine that you are typing a bibliography page for a report you’ve prepared. You typed each entry as you might any paragraph, as in the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. <span class="emphasis"><em>The Journal of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes</em></span>, 20(2), 125-147.</p></blockquote></div><p>As are most paragraphs you type, the entry is formatted with a first-line indent, which is fine and dandy—except that you want a hanging indent, which is the norm for bibliography entries. Rather than messing around with tabs or margins to get things the way you want, all you have to do is click your mouse anywhere within the paragraph and then double-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Hanging indent</strong></span> entry in the Styles and Formatting window. After that, as if by magic (though you know better), the transformation is made:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. <span class="emphasis"><em>The Journal of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes</em></span>, 20(2), 125-147.</p></blockquote></div><p>You could follow the same procedure for each of your other entries or, with Hanging indent selected, click the <span class="strong"><strong>paint can</strong></span> button in the Styles and Formatting window. Now your mouse cursor, when placed over the document, will appear as a paint can. Click in any other paragraph in your bibliography, and that entry, too, will be formatted in the new style. The process is essentially the same when applying different styles to any other document elements.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0035"/></p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Word Processing Done Lightly with AbiWord"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="word_processing_done_lightly_with_abiwor"/>Word Processing Done Lightly with AbiWord</h1></div></div></div><p>If LibreOffice’s Writer is a bit more powerful than what you need for your everyday word processing chores and you would prefer something that pops up as soon as you click the Launcher icon, then you might want to consider another word processor, AbiWord (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_other_linux_word_processormabiword" title="Figure 12-9. The other Linux word processor—AbiWord">Figure 12-9</a>).

Dlume is a simple standalone address book application that feels light and easy to use. It allows you to easily search for names in your address book and to export all your information in CSV or HTML formats. You can run Dlume from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> filter button, or just type the name in the search box and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="dlume_address_book_application"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14712"/><img alt="Dlume address book application" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263792.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-11. Dlume address book application</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="gLabels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="glabels"/>gLabels</h2></div></div></div><p>One of my personal favorite office-esque apps is gLabels (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#glabels-id1" title="Figure 12-12. gLabels">Figure 12-12</a>), which I’ve used from my very earliest days as a Linux user. As the name suggests, gLabels is an application for laying out and printing various types of labels; although the name does not suggest it, gLabels is also great for making business cards. It includes templates for most, if not all, of the label and card stock out there from Avery and a few other manufacturers. While it’s true that you can do most of what gLabels does in LibreOffice or Scribus (which I will mention later in this chapter), I’m sure you will find gLabels to be the easiest and most intuitive way to get the job done, especially when it comes to setting up cards or labels with graphics or special layouts.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0040"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0042"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Tomboy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="tomboy"/>Tomboy</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the downsides of the new Unity desktop environment is that you can’t run most GNOME panel applets anymore . . . well, not easily anyway. Sticky Notes, the app that allowed you to post little yellow Post-it-like notes on the desktop, is one such app. Fortunately, the more full-featured answer to Sticky Notes, called Tomboy (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#desktop_notes_with_some_oomphmtomboy" title="Figure 12-13. Desktop notes with some oomph—Tomboy">Figure 12-13</a>), does work in Unity. Once installed and launched, Tomboy works as a panel applet, positioning itself with the other status indicator icons at the right side of the Unity top panel. From that Tomboy menu, you can add and edit notes and control other Tomboy functions.</p><div class="figure"><a id="glabels-id1"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14743"/><img alt="gLabels" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263794.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-12. gLabels</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="desktop_notes_with_some_oomphmtomboy"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14751"/><img alt="Desktop notes with some oomph—Tomboy" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263796.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-13. Desktop notes with some oomph—Tomboy</p></div><p>One of the most touted of Tomboy’s features is its search and hyperlink functions. These allow you to search for entries within your entire Tomboy note library and create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to another linked note. In fact, Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink whenever you type a word that matches one of your existing note headings. To make matters even more exciting (or at least more useful), Tomboy, by means of its plug-ins feature, allows you to export notes to HTML or print them, either as hard copy or as PDFs.</p><p>Once you’ve downloaded and installed Tomboy, you can run it from the Dash, either by typing its name and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span> or by clicking the Applications lens and then the <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> filter button.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="FreeMind"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="freemind"/>FreeMind</h2></div></div></div><p>If you like to think graphically by charting out your ideas, then the mind-mapping application FreeMind (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#freemind-id1" title="Figure 12-14. Freemind">Figure 12-14</a>) might be perfect for you. FreeMind allows you to lay out your ideas graphically and save your results in a number of formats, including PDF, PNG, JPEG, and SVG.

Scribus is designed to produce commercial-grade output, and it supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK colors, PostScript handling, and creation of color separations, to name but a few. There is a fairly good support network out there for Scribus and an online tutorial too (<a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus">http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus</a>), so you won’t be alone if you find yourself getting into this application.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0044"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-12-0045"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="scribus-id1"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e14807"/><img alt="Scribus" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263800.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-15. Scribus</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
