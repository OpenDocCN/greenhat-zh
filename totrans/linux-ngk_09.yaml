    an environment in which you do everything the hard way by command line. In this
    era of graphical interfaces, the idea of typing commands to get things done seems
    a dreadful throwback to the days of DOS, and that puts many people off — especially
    those who remember what it was like in those “old days.”'

    the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some
    sort of graphical interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they hope
    to achieve through drop- down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many are able to survive
    quite happily without ever once opening their Terminal. The same could be true
    of you.

    of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be utilized within
    a graphical environment provided by the Terminal application also makes it much
    less forbidding. The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of graphical
    bodies (see [Figure 9-1](#figure.DDU92)). Using the command line can be as harmless
    as anything else you do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a
    little fun if you are willing to give it a try.

    whenever possible, to use the command line as a complement to the various graphical
    tools that you have at your disposal, rather than presenting it as the sole way
    of going about things. Of course, I am not going to cover every possible angle
    in this regard — just enough to give you some exposure and experience and, hopefully,
    make you feel at least a little more at ease with the command line. Who knows;
    you might actually come to think of using the command line as . . . fun? Well,

    the **rpm** command to update that file. If there is no such **dog** file on your

    flag, **v** (verbose), tells the **rpm** command to give you a progress report
    of what is going on. The last flag, **h**(hash), tells the command to use hash
    marks (###) as the means by which to indicate that progress — a sort of Terminal

    download.html. Once there, scroll down to the **Unix/Linux/X11** section and click
    the link that says **pyChing’s sourceforge download page**. This will take you
    to the download page, where you should download the latest tarball version. At
    the time of this writing, that would be **pyching-1.2.1.tar.gz**.

- en: pyChing is also a Python script, and it is created by the same person as pyWings,
    so the process of installing it will be exactly the same. The only difference
    is that you will type pyching in every place that you typed pywings earlier, and
    pyching-1.2.1.tar.gz instead of pywings-1.0.1.tar.gz. You also do not need to
    install tkinter and its dependencies again.

- en: Now that you have had some fun using the command line, let’s fill in one of
    the missing pieces in your system — the Macromedia Flash plug-in for your Mozilla
    browser. As you might know, there are a good number of Web sites that are written
    using Macromedia’s Flash. In order to view the Flash content of such sites, you
    must have the Flash player plug-in installed for your browser.

- en: If you go to the Macromedia plug-in test page at [http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/welcome,](http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/welcome)
    you can see what I mean. Without the Flash plug- in installed, any Flash content
    in a Web page will merely appear as a plug-in icon, which looks like a blue jigsaw
    puzzle piece (see [Figure 9-13](#figure.DDU104)). Needless to say, in order to
    remedy the situation, you need to install the plug-in.

    accompanying this book (Disk 3, if you are using the full three-disk set), so
    just copy the file from the CD to your Tarballs_and_RPMs folder. You could do
    this via the Command Terminal, but because the filename is long, it is probably
    easiest to just drag it there. (If you’re a Red Hat Linux 9 user, you can skip
    this step.)

    procedures that you now have experience with. To start off, install the RPM file
    by going to your Tarballs_and_RPMs folder and double-clicking on the **compat-libstdc++**
    file. After that, just follow the standard RPM installation procedures you learned
    in [Chapter 8](DDU0064_split_000.html#345).

- en: To extract the **install_flash_player_6_linux.tar.gz** tarball, just double-click
    it, which will open the File Roller program. In the first File Roller window,
    click **Extract**, and in the second window click **OK**. When the process is
    complete, you will have a new install_flash_player_6_linux folder in your Home
    folder. You can then quit the File Roller program.

    to see if your installation was successful. The Flash section should now look
    like that in [Figure 9-14](#figure.DDU105). If so, you can now drag the **install_flash_player_6_linux**
    folder to the Trash (or right-click it, and select **Move to Trash**), as its
    job is done. You can also do the same to the **install_flash_player_6_linux.tar.gz**
    tarball, though I would back up the tarball to CD first, just in case you need
    to do this all again someday.
