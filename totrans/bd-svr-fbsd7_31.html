<p class="docText1"><a name="of the" class="calibre8" id="of the"/>Lynx began as a project of the University of Kansas in 1989. The university wanted to create a campus-wide information system. Lynx was developed as an interface to this information-sharing project. Connections to the campus network were made using Unix-based consoles that did not support graphical interfaces. Early versions of Lynx supported a proprietary hypertext format; this feature was subsequently dropped after support for HTML was added.<a name="IDX-CHP-12-0196" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-12-0196"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="and Michael" class="calibre8" id="and Michael"/>Lou Montulli, Charles Rezac, and Michael Grobe were the initial designers of Lynx at the University of Kansas. They have since moved on to other pursuits. Lynx was adopted by an international team of volunteers in 1994; they continue Lynx development today.</p>
