      the company's product and company technology. At many small firms,
      planning is limited because of lack of time to take on the task. Even
      though day-to-day activities can be overwhelming, you should set aside
      some time on a regular basis to plan for the future.</p><p>This section discusses approaches and methods to help you make
      forward-looking planning more systematic. It includes techniques for
      selecting projects, project estimation and planning, and general

<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="setting_the_direction"/>Chapter 18. SETTING THE DIRECTION</h1></div></div></div><p>The development manager must oversee the product <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1055"/>and technical directions for the development team; he also
      works with marketing to set the product direction for the company.
      Developing the direction should be a collaborative effort that involves
      the technical leaders of the sales, marketing, and development teams.
      Important considerations in setting product direction include market
      requirements, customer requirements, industry technical direction, and
      company needs.</p><p>If you fail to set the direction, the direction will be set for
      you by default. Without specific direction, engineers can be influenced
      and motivated by factors that are not particularly business focused,
      such as the thrill of working with new technologies or approaches or
      rewriting code rather than reusing it. Engineers also have strong
      preferences for particular software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1056"/>and systems, and they may select third-party packages
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1057"/>based on short-term utility while not considering
      long-term costs, effect on quality, and business risks.</p><p>If you're new to the company, take a look at how development made
      technology decisions in the past before you set the direction for the
      future. Try to understand the reasoning behind past decisions. Think
      about choices of language, operating systems, computers, third-party
      software, and data formats. Consider past "create-versus-buy" decisions.
      Knowing how decisions were made in the past can help you understand any
      biases of the team and will give you ideas for improving the technical
      decision-making going forward. In some cases, the reasons for past
      decisions may not be clear—but this should not prevent you from
      documenting decisions now or in the future.</p><p>You cannot set technical direction in a vacuum. As you consider a
      strategy, review it with the executive team and encourage input and
      support. Decisions are affected by high- and low-priority issues, with
      trade-offs and compromises being common. Proper communication with the
      executive team ensures that everyone is aware of the big picture,
      including its pros and cons.</p><p>As the technical leader, your decisions in setting the future
      technical direction require that you consider five elements: Listen to
      the market, create a whole product, defuse hidden technical time bombs,
      plan for required technical overhauls, and optimize customer
      setup.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="listen_to_the_market"/>Listen to the Market</h1></div></div></div><p>As you plan a product and technology direction, consider the
        requirements of current customers and the current and future
        market.</p><p>Sales, marketing, and customer service teams can help you learn
        more about your customers' interests. Meet with customers. Spend time
        observing as users work with your product; this can provide great
        insight into how you might improve the product. Ask customers about
        their concerns, their future plans for using the product, and their
        ideas for new features. To appreciate the big picture, you can compile
        data gathered from multiple customers.</p><p>Current customers can provide great evolutionary advice about
        your product, and potential new customers can help identify key
        features that are missing. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1058"/>As most small companies grow by acquiring new customers
        and selling more products to current customers, looking ahead to new
        customers' needs should be an important part of your planning efforts.
        If you focus only on current customers' needs, you can run the risk of
        over-customizing your product to suit a smaller potential market. The
        product marketing team should regularly examine your company's
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1059"/>markets, talking to current and potential customers.
        This information allows the team to identify different groups of
        customers with similar problems. For each group, the marketing team
        can examine the value a potential solution would bring, and the
        development team can determine practicality and potential costs of
        solutions. With different options identified, marketing can set the
        product direction.</p><p>This may sound like a straightforward process, but it often
        involves multiple iterations and examination of different ideas to
        isolate those with the best potential for the next product offering.
        With the cooperation of marketing and engineering, this process can
        occur in a systematic way.</p><p>As you examine potential <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1060"/>markets, stretch your current product in different
        dimensions to consider potential for new opportunities. Some new
        opportunities require simplifying your product and offering it
        packaged at a lower price. Other opportunities require new specialized
        features. Still other opportunities include different industry
        "verticals"—meaning that your product can be used to solve a similar
        set of problems for a different industry.</p><p>Tackling new market verticals should not be considered lightly.
        Be prepared for a larger effort. Entering a new market vertical
        usually involves considerably more work than expanding a product line
        in an existing vertical—not just in customer sales efforts, but also
        in learning the problems and concerns of the new industry. The
        development team needs technical expertise in the requirements of the
        new industry before a new product is designed and built. Part of your
        planning should be to account for the engineering training time
        required to attack new verticals.</p><p>Investigating the product's future is an ongoing task for the
        development manager and others, and planning for the future should not
        be limited to an annual strategic planning session. These discussions
        provide valuable information that should be considered at least once a
        quarter. Failing to discuss the product future regularly can add huge
        time lags into planning processes and can make the product's (and
        company's) future less dynamic and less successful.</p></div></div>

        product</em></span> concept<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-18-FNOTE-1" id="CHP-18-FNOTE-1">7</a>]</sup> describes not only providing a software product that
        customers want to buy, but providing a complete solution to the
        customers' problems and needs. A whole product includes the software,
        customer services, technical support, appropriate technical
        interfaces, ease of integration with other tools, ease of
        installation, and a forward-looking plan. A development manager cannot
        focus solely on the product software. Instead, look at what it takes
        to expand the software into a whole product, with a focus on
        interfaces, integration with other tools, and ease of customer
        implementation.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1062"/></p><p>If the costs and effort required to assist customers with
        implementation of your product are high, you should examine this area
        carefully and often. Small company sales are influenced by customer
        implementation difficulties and costs. Customers find enterprise
        systems difficult to implement in general, so a simplified system will
        attract sales. Company management can neglect to attack product
        implementation improvements early enough in the company's growth
        cycle. High implementation costs will stall out a small company's
        growth.</p><p>Some software categories require extensive numbers of interfaces
        to different systems to be accepted by the market. The next new
        interfaces are not necessarily as fun to implement <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1063"/>as a new product feature, but they can result in high
        sales value. Examine your interface needs early with marketing and
        plan for growth.</p><p>For some software products, direct interfaces with other tools
        are essential for success. As with interfaces, this is not a glamour
        area for software engineering, but it is essential for maximizing your
        product's value for the customer and its overall success.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e15020"/></p><p>Looking <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1064"/>ahead often requires marketing binoculars to identify
        future directions. However, sometimes it requires donning a flak
        jacket and looking for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1065"/>hidden problems.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#CHP-18-FNOTE-1" id="ftn.CHP-18-FNOTE-1">7</a>] </sup>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1061"/>whole product concept is the topic of the book

        will go off when you least expect it. These <span class="emphasis"><em>technology time
        bombs</em></span> are caused by technical choices at the beginning of
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1066"/>product development that result in problems that explode
        in the future. Engineers can create such problems by focusing on a
        quick product construction while ignoring the long-term effects of
        their choices. In addition, engineers making technical choices can
        have personal biases that might not represent the best long-term
        business choices for the current situation.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1067"/></p><p>Technology time bombs have different delay times and different
        effects when they explode. Knowing what to look for as a development
        manager can help you spot these issues early enough so that the
        problem does not leave your company unable to support its customers.
        Consider the following areas when reviewing your technology and
        looking for potential problems:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span>How standard is the data format chosen
            for communicating with customers? Does it add to customer costs
            when they integrate with your system?</span></span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes data formats are not specified at the outset of
              the project, so the engineering team will use the most
              convenient format, which might prove to be very inconvenient for
              future customers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>Did the team build code for a software
            component, even though a reasonable commercial component was
            available?</span></span></dt><dd><p>This is referred to as "the not invented here syndrome."
              Some engineers want to re-create components for their own
              education or so that they have complete control over the
              code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>Was an uncommon language used in your
            product's construction?</span></span></dt><dd><p>This can result in difficulty finding and hiring
              appropriate replacement engineers. As a small growing company,
              actively avoid this problem, since use of common languages
              should be the norm. But uncommon languages may be used when a
              technologist has a personal interest in or preference for
              them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span>What are the reasons behind key

        reliability, and long-term costs. Although <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1074"/>avoiding a blowup might not always be possible,
        minimizing the effects usually is.</p><p>Some technical choices can present serious technical flaws that
        are not easily repaired. When this happens, you might need to make
        major changes to the code base. It may be time for a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1075"/>technology overhaul.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="plan_a_technology_overhaul"/>Plan a Technology Overhaul</h1></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>technology</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>overhaul</em></span>
        involves the replacement of major sections of the current code or
        redesigning the product's architecture, while keeping the
        functionality of the code roughly the same. A new technology may be
        required to solve systematic design flaws. Consider an overhaul in
        response to major issues that cannot be fixed gradually along with new
        development.</p><p>The need for an overhaul can often occur on a legacy system you
        inherited. On the other hand, an overhaul can be a nightmare for a
        development manager who supervised building the system in the first
        place. In either case, explain to your boss and peers why the choices
        were made in the first place and why significant changes need to be
        made now.</p><p>Time and resources are always scarce in small companies, so
        competition for them can be intense. If you don't get peer and
        management buy-in, dealing with expensive problems that are not easily
        visible and do not produce short-term visible results can result in
        misunderstandings and mistrust.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e15195"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e15200"/></p><p>Also consider the impact of an overhaul on your customers. These
        changes might (and often do) force changes in the customer's
        operations or technology. For example, your changes might require that
        the customer purchase a new third-party application, such as database
        software. You must consider the customer impact before starting the
        work and offer your customers sufficient notice of upcoming
        changes.</p><p>How the overhaul is handled depends on the projected cost and
        business needs. If the overhaul is "minor" and development can
        complete it in a single focused release over a three- to six-month
        period, implementing the changes at once makes the most sense. It will
        require the support of marketing and sales, because a release that
        does not improve the product features can cause problems with sales
        growth. You will need a strong business case for performing a
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1076"/>technology overhaul, as doing so will displace other
        important product work.</p><p>If the changes are not minor and cannot fit into a single
        short-term cycle, your choices are more difficult. A one- to two-year
        overhaul project rarely makes business sense for a small company. It
        leaves the company's product features static for too long. The time
        delay of the overhaul invites a large amount of risk from competition
        and from loss of momentum with existing and future customers.</p><p>One approach for an overhaul is to map out the effort by major
        sections per release. This can be difficult to coordinate along with
        normal releases and will drag out the effort over a longer time if
        additional staff is not available. Another approach is to build the
        new system in parallel with work supporting the existing system. This
        can be logically simpler but requires extra staff and infrastructure
        that you may need to scale back at the end of the effort.</p><p>In summary, when you believe a technology overhaul is needed,
        you must create and present a clear business case for it and continue
        to push the issue toward resolution. Don't wait until the system blows
        up and hurts your product and customers.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="optimize_customer_setup"/>Optimize Customer Setup</h1></div></div></div><p>Although shrink-wrapped, mass-produced software is sold "as is,"
        many products and services require additional setup procedures before
        the customer can realize the full potential of the software. Companies
        that sell products that require or benefit from setup efforts often
        overlook the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1077"/>costs of such operations. If these costs are ignored,
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1078"/>optimizing the customer setup is usually ignored as
        well.</p><p>Creating a great product that is expensive to deploy per
        customer may not be problematic if your customer base is small, since
        the costs in such a case could also be small. But as your customer
        base grows, so do the costs of these extra efforts—with increasing
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1079"/>customizations, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1080"/>rollout times, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1081"/>rollout costs. Most small companies cannot afford large
        time delays or high development costs with each new customer, and
        problems with implementation and setup can cause loss of sales, as
        more potential customers hear about problems associated with your
        product.</p><p>If customers are willing to pay for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1082"/>customization of your product, sales with more
        customization options might be viable. However, a product that
        requires heavy customization per customer means that your development
        staff must grow as sales increase. Such an approach defines a
        consulting business model, which requires a different consideration of
        costs, sales, and expenses than required for a one-size-fits-all
        software package.</p><p>Combining a consulting business model with a software product
        business model is a difficult task for a single software company.
        Customers will always try to push down the price of the custom coding
        or will expect it to be free with an expensive product. This will make
        the customization more of a cost than a sale for your company.
        Therefore, you must minimize customization efforts and costs early on,
        before the company's growth phase.</p><p>If customization is part of the company's business plan, create
        a separate group or business unit for customization efforts, with
        different price requirements determined for the product and service
        parts of the business. Top-level agreements about how concessions will
        be made will simplify the sales process when customers place pressure
        on the product or service element of a sale.</p><p>Whether paid for or not, delays from sale to rollout add time
        before a new customer can become a paying customer. Large delays
        during a growth phase will hurt your company's cash flow and ability
        to grow, even if the company has all the customers it wants. Growth
        strains cash flow because your company must spend cash well in advance
        of receiving payment from customers, and the current cash input will
        be less than the cash output.</p><p>The higher the growth rate and longer the delay from costs to
        revenues, the higher the profit required on past sales to sustain the
        company without outside investment. This situation is even worse for
        the software as a service (SaaS) model, in which customers pay your
        company over time instead of providing a lump sum payment.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1083"/>Rollout and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1084"/>customization requirements affect not only the
        development team, but also the operations, support, documentation, and
        project management teams. The development team can usually find ways
        to help reduce the costs and delays that other teams face if
        developers focus on the most important problems.</p><p>If your business model requires <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1085"/>customization to get users up and running, look for ways
        to optimize this process before you are inundated with orders. To cut
        time and costs, first figure out the current <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-18-1086"/>rollout time and cost per new customer. The process of
        calculating the costs will require that you examine the steps and the
        process to identify multiple ways of reducing time or minimizing
        error.</p><p>Other solutions vary for cutting times and cost depending on the
        analysis. Here are some examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Change the bundling and scope of the product to reduce

            of large companies, which expect more attention and customization
            with large software purchases. Large companies have the financial
            influence to demand free customizations while squeezing you on

            also enhance the product for the general market, but avoid making
            such rationalizations if they are not truly the case. From a
            business risk perspective, a CEO often prefers several smaller
            sales over one large sale. More sales can reduce risk if something
            goes wrong with a deal. However, the CEO's strategy may prefer
            large sales over smaller ones if company credibility will benefit

      financial plan—it requires a product strategy and a product roadmap
      based on thoughtful analysis of where the company began, where it is
      heading in the future, and how it plans to get there. The development
      manager plays a critical role in the process by producing a realistic
      product roadmap that sets the course and coordinates business needs with
      development, marketing, sales, and other team strategies.</p><p>Senior management must look continuously at the road ahead while
      remembering the paths the company has already taken. As a senior
      manager, you must watch your step to avoid pitfalls while focusing on
      the horizon that leads to your company's future.</p><p>After you have determined your destination, planned your route,
      and scouted out the immediate path, you can complete a short-term (less
      than one year), middle-term (one to three years), and long-term (three
      to six years) strategic plan.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="missing_the_middle"/><p class="title"><b>MISSING THE MIDDLE</b></p><p>At my company, I clearly observed the split between short-term
        and longer-term planning. The managers had no interest in aligning the
        two. Politics dictated the short-term tactics; investors wanted to see
        movement in selected areas. Management sold the long-term plan to
        investors as it showed a rosy future. Part of the reason for not
        aligning the two plans in the middle may have been management
        cynicism. If they built out the middle-term plan and saw a big gap
        between the longer-term promises and the direction they were heading,
        they could not tell investors they believed in the longer-term
        financial models.</p><p>Development met the short-term goals over the next nine months,
        but the company did not succeed in stepping toward its longer-term
        goal because management had no plan to get there.</p><p>—Project management director</p></div><p>Failing to see the short-term path in front of you can get you
      stuck in a hole, while a lack of long-term vision can leave you
      wandering; however, a common and dangerous problem at a small company is
      missing the middle term: No plan for getting from here to there (the
      destination) is determined and regularly updated. Without a complete
      strategic plan that includes the middle, you may seize short-term
      opportunities that lead away from longer term goals. Non-strategic
      short-term choices do not build on each other to increase corporate
      value. Instead, these choices bring in short-term revenue at the expense
      of future potential.</p><p>Creating a full strategic plan that includes a middle-term plan
      takes an executive team effort. The team will need to consider many
      aspects to provide a solution that meets the company goals, including
      the product roadmap, company finances, expected sales, and company
      staffing plan.</p><p>Even more important than creating the plan is reviewing it
      quarterly and making adjustments as needed. Many companies create
      strategic plans once a year and then file them away rather than updating
      them regularly. The process of replanning provides the real value in
      strategic planning, not the plan itself.</p><p>From a development leadership perspective, you will find it
      challenging to hold to the high road rather than go with the flow. It
      takes a bit of political skill to convince others that some short-term
      choices can be detrimental in the long term. However, don't simply and
      quietly accept short-term product choices that won't get your company
      where it wants to go; make your opinion heard on the big issues.</p><p>With this information in mind, let's look at the planning area in
      which development has the largest influence and concerns—the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>product roadmap</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1087"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="creating_a_product_roadmap"/>Creating a Product Roadmap</h1></div></div></div><p>Product roadmaps are usually developed with marketing to define
        the evolution of the product line(s) over time, and they focus on the
        major shifts that impact the product and its market. The roadmap must
        not be a marketing fantasy; it must be based on realistic development
        assumptions about a product course that is reasonable to achieve and
        that produces the product the company and its customers expect.
        Creating a product roadmap requires that you have a solid
        understanding of the current product goals, along with its flaws and
        limitations that can affect the course.</p><p>Start with the marketing strategy and consider several major
        product options. Also consider other major efforts that the company
        expects development to undertake, such as develop projects that
        improve productivity, repair faulty systems, close customer deals, and
        improve corporate image. All company project efforts should be
        considered while creating the product roadmap.</p><p>Let's look at a straightforward approach to comparing different
        options.</p></div></div>

        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1088"/>CB analysis is used to determine which projects will
        create the most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1089"/>revenue. This analysis is underutilized in the software
        market because of the complexities in estimating potential benefits of
        any investment and the ability to accurately forecast the costs of
        vaguely stated objectives. However, CB analysis can be an effective

        overall management team's judgment about what will happen during each
        product cycle, and they also allow you to compare potential successes
        of multiple projects. This information is valuable to consider when
        thinking about future product planning.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1092"/>Cost-benefit calculations can be wrong, but the relative
        values for projects proposed are likely to be close to actual relative
        values. You can use these calculations to make comparative choices on
        new project proposals. Some projects improve customer experience or
        simplify an internal task, but they need to be evaluated against all
        other projects and the returns compared before they can be
        selected.</p><p>Projects come in multiple types: <span class="emphasis"><em>Revenue</em></span>
        projects bring in money. <span class="emphasis"><em>Productivity</em></span> projects
        can improve the effectiveness of the team so they lower costs and
        improve services. <span class="emphasis"><em>Required</em></span> projects describe
        projects with an external mandate—such as projects based on federal
        regulations for medical software companies and Year 2000 software
        upgrades. <span class="emphasis"><em>Risk Reduction</em></span> projects reduce the
        chance of a disruption of your business. <span class="emphasis"><em>Image</em></span>
        projects improve the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1093"/>company's image but do not increase revenue directly.
        Typically, small growing companies avoid <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1094"/>image projects because the revenue is either zero or
        very difficult to define, but in some cases the right image project
        can be key to company success.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1095"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1096"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1097"/></p><p>In small companies, revenue is usually emphasized. Some
        companies focus only on revenue and ignore productivity and risk
        reduction until after problems become acute. Should revenue always
        trump productivity and risk projections? The short answer is
        no—revenue can dominate but it should not always win. Failure to
        consider risk reduction or productivity issues can be fatal to a small
        growing company, because both risk and productivity issues increase as
        the company grows.</p><p>Many small companies do not use <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1098"/>cost-benefit analysis to investigate future projects,
        relying instead on executive instinct or voting selection processes.
        Both instinct and voting can easily produce less-then-optimum results,
        however, when appropriate information hasn't been gathered. They also
        are subject to individual biases that may not be in the best interest
        of the company.</p><p>In general, cost-benefit analysis isn't the end-all solution,
        but it can offer good advice on what makes sense when planning an
        organization's future.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="project_selection_by_sales"/><p class="title"><b>PROJECT SELECTION BY SALES</b></p><p>At my company, year-long projects were voted on by a sales
          staff of about 12. The company needed to make three sales for the
          product to break even on development costs. Most sales people knew
          of only a single potential sale for the project in their region, so
          they had a strong incentive to place their vote where the next sale
          would occur, even if they knew that the company could sell only one
          product.</p><p>My company needed a stronger marketing department to survey
          the sales people and talk to customers. This would have let them
          determine the overall market for each customer and then select
          products with the highest potential sales over a three-year period.

          projects to ensure consistency. All project analyses should be
          weighted similarly for crucial factors.</p><p>One crucial factor is the time frame for the analysis—the
          length of time considered for benefits, risks, and costs. The choice
          of time frame can vary based on the type of business and on the size
          of the company's projects, with larger projects requiring longer
          time frames. For most small software businesses, using two or three
          years for the analysis works well. Use the time frame consistently
          for all projects you analyze.</p><p>The next step is to evaluate the time and expenses on the
          project for your standard time frame. This estimate will vary
          depending on the type of effort defined earlier: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1100"/>revenue, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1101"/>productivity, requirements, risk, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1102"/>image projects. Then, for different types of projects,
          consider the financial benefits versus the probability (odds) of
          achieving those benefits. For a revenue project, you can estimate
          the total sales expected. For a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1103"/>risk reduction project, calculate the odds of the risk
          being realized and the financial penalty of the risk happening (the
          negative benefit). For a productivity project, look at the benefit
          of saved time and money versus any probability of not realizing this
          benefit. For <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1104"/>required projects, do not calculate the benefit, but
          do estimate the costs; then assign a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1105"/>CB value to add at the top of the list. For <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1106"/>image projects, calculating the benefits can be very
          difficult, but getting the best guess down on paper is
          useful.</p><p>With all of this information in hand, you can calculate the CB
          for a project using this formula:</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>CB = Benefit dollar value</em></span> x
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Probability of benefit</em></span> ÷ <span class="emphasis"><em>Benefit

          million in sales over three years (benefit) with probability of
          sales success estimated at 70 percent and a cost of $200,000, then
          the CB is 3.5 ($1,000,000 x 0.70 ÷ $200,000). Alternatively, a risk
          reduction project with a cost of $1,000 to solve a problem that
          could cost $50,000 with a probability of 5 percent would have a CB
          of 2.5 ($50,000 x 0.05 ÷ $1,000).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-15"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>CB is a unitless value, as it divides money by

        which describes the underlying project at a high level and includes
        many of the assumptions. The one-page assessment is a useful tool that
        complements <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1111"/>cost-benefit analysis. Each assessment provides a quick
        overview of the proposed project, its costs, and its benefits. The
        executive team can review the assessments along with the CB project
        summary table when determining which projects to authorize. The
        one-page assessment is the initial guide to whether the team should
        investigate the project further. It is also handy months later if an
        executive team member asks for information about a particular
        project's assessment.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-19-1112"/></p><p>Anyone on the executive team can collect the information for the
        one-page assessments; however, most of the assessments will require
        that the information be collected from several different executives.
        Marketing and engineering should be consulted for all
        assessments.</p><p>A typical one-page assessment describes these items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Title (at top)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Author</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Date</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Version</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type of project (keyword)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Description (including dependencies)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Benefit (statement of reason for doing project)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Costs (in dollars and labor)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Timeline</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Recommendations</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch19s03.html#template_for_a_one-page_assessment" title="Figure 19-1. Template for a one-page assessment">Figure 19-1</a> shows a

If
          you determine that the smaller projects can be broken down into
          independent projects, consider breaking them up before performing
          the final analysis.</p><p>Sometimes projects can be divided into smaller portions that
          can be easily analyzed. For large projects that span a year, for
          example, consider breaking them up into blocks of functionalities
          that offer distinct values to the customer. For each component,
          perform a cost-benefit calculation specifically focused on the
          perceived value of the product to the customer with only that
          functionality. This analysis approach is more difficult than project
          cost-benefit calculations, because calculating the financial return
          for pieces of functionality can be an abstract concept. However,
          discussing with marketing the relative value versus cost for
          functional blocks offers considerable utility, since it forces
          marketing to prioritize and record the effective values of different
          feature sets. Allowing marketing or management to indicate that all
          features must be included in the product in no particular order
          before it has any value lowers the project's chance for
          success.</p><p>Collecting the effective value of subcomponents will involve
          discussions with multiple customers to understand how they perceive
          the value of the product. After these discussions, write down the
          relative values of the subcomponents; this information can be very
          useful in the future. Management and new customers can often drive
          new feature requests into the product without considering the impact
          these may have on other planned features. A broader perspective lets
          the team choose implementation sequences that benefit your company
          the most.</p></div></div>

      lot of ground. With so much information to consider, the path forward
      can seem daunting. Fortunately, you have a guidebook on hand to help you
      find your way.</p><p>If you are a new manager, don't worry if that feeling of being
      lost in the woods is still with you. At ground level, the trees look
      similar and they all block your view, but don't wander around the forest
      floor hoping to find yourself somewhere you want to be. Instead, change
      your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-20-1115"/>perspective regularly—climb a tree to get above the forest
      so you can view the landscape. A manager needs to be able to see the big
      picture and understand how his or her hard work relates to it.
      Consequently, make a regular effort to revisit the high-level view of
      your company and your development efforts. If you don't like what you
      see, make changes. To sum it up: Stop, assess, and then act.</p><p>A little retrospective thinking can also help. Think about where
      you've been and where you are now. If you like people, software,
      technology, and management, your job should be exciting and fun overall.
      If you haven't felt that way in a while, shake yourself awake and ask
      why work isn't energizing. This will lead you to change either where you
      are spending your time, what you are prioritizing, or how you are
      leading. It can also lead you away from your current company.</p><p>Remember that being the development manager isn't about ego, job
      perks, being in charge, or other direct benefits to you. It's about you
      guiding your team to success. Good management means supporting your
      team, helping development staff grow, treating team members fairly, and
      helping the business along. Treating others well may not always advance
      your career, but it will make you a good manager who earns the respect
      of your team, boss, co-workers, and ultimately yourself. And that will
      make the journey worthwhile.</p></div>
<div class="appendix" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="software_company_structure"/>Appendix A. SOFTWARE COMPANY STRUCTURE</h1></div></div></div><p>Structuring the organizational aspects of a growing software
      company requires that you understand the tasks that the company needs to
      perform. When the company first starts, the leadership often distributes
      the tasks among the staff. As the company grows, these tasks will also
      grow in size and number, and new employees will need to be hired. As new
      employees are hired, the organization of the company will shift, and
      roles will become more specialized.</p><p>This appendix illustrates how company structure changes as a
      company grows. To illustrate the changes, some key small company sizes
      are examined along with their associated <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1116"/>organizational structures. The companies described are
      modeled after small software product companies, rather than software
      contracting firms. Although the descriptions are detailed, they are not
      intended to define the only ways to structure a small company—in
      practice, other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1117"/>organizational structures can also be used
      successfully.</p><p>The sizes of companies discussed here are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>One-person software company</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Two-person software company</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Twelve-person software company</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fifty-person software company</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Hundred-plus–person software company</p></li></ul></div><p>The first four examples illustrate a
      functional/hierarchical<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-A-FNOTE-1" id="CHP-A-FNOTE-1">9</a>]</sup> organization, as it is the most common structure for
      smaller firms. A hundred-plus–person software company often uses other
      organizational structures. Although you don't need to wait until your
      company has more than 100 people on staff to reorganize, the pressure
      that occurs at that point becomes large enough that the issue of an
      effective organization becomes particularly pressing.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="company_tasks"/>Company Tasks</h1></div></div></div><p>To understand companies of different sizes, you must first
        consider the business and software development tasks that are required
        to create a working software company. These tasks fall into two
        general categories: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1118"/>business tasks and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1119"/>software life cycle tasks. <span class="emphasis"><em>Software life cycle

        as revenue grows are sales, customer support, and engineering.
        Engineering efforts can increase rapidly as the company grows, because

        or president may separate marketing from sales and HR from finance at
        this level. For the software-as-a-service model, the company may
        require an operations department. The following departments would be

        build and release engineer) as some functions can add to efficiency at
        a lower cost.</p><p>Compared to a 12-person company, a 50-person company does not

        the industry, overall goals of the company, background of the CEO, and
        specific short-term needs of the company. For example, for product
        companies with a stronger emphasis on quality, the ratio of quality
        team to engineering staff will be closer to 1:1. In some firms, this
        ratio can be as high as 10:1 engineers to QA, but this is definitely

        strong within the functional areas, but it is weaker between
        functional teams.</p><p>As companies grow to one hundred employees or more, management
        usually considers different methods of restructuring the organization.
        The CEO can choose multiple <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1135"/>organizational approaches but typically chooses a
        straight hierarchy, a matrix structure, or segmenting by small product
        teams.</p><p>As companies grow, communication that worked with fewer staff
        ceases to work well. In a small company, instant messaging (IM), many
        rapid emails, yelling over the cube walls, or walking to someone's
        desk every time you have a question works well. In a larger company,
        however, such approaches can overwhelm employees with too much noise
        and too many communications from too many sources.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm_d1e16219"/></p><p>Managers sometimes try to shield their employees, demanding that
        all communications go up the ladder and back down so management can
        triage. This can seem isolating, as it creates workgroup "silos." This
        approach is an inefficient way to get work done.</p><p>Let's consider several different approaches to organizing a
        larger software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1136"/>company. Structured approaches include a hierarchy, a
        matrix, many small product teams, and a flexible product team. For all
        of these approaches, bear in mind the main functions of management:
        organizing work for sale (such as project work), supporting individual
        employees (mentoring and coaching), and improving the overall
        organization (process improvement and hiring).</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hierarchical_structure"/>Hierarchical Structure</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>hierarchical structure</em></span> for a company
          has each person reporting to a single manager. In a hierarchy, a
          clear chain of command exists. A hierarchy divides tasks by
          functional area. In each area, a manager controls the
          function.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1137"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1138"/></p><p><a class="xref" href="apas06.html#company_hierarchy_example" title="Figure A-3. Company hierarchy example">Figure A-3</a> illustrates a
          simplified company hierarchy.</p><div class="figure"><a id="company_hierarchy_example"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e16256"/><img alt="Company hierarchy example" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266161.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure A-3. Company hierarchy example</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A hierarchical structure has some advantages over other
          structures. First, a hierarchy offers a clear chain of command. The
          top management makes directives and sends them down the management
          chain. Second, management can reduce communication paths by creating
          separate functional teams, which reduces communication noise. The
          different functional teams communicate mostly internally at a
          smaller scale, while inter-team communication is reduced. In
          addition, functional areas can optimize internal workflow.</p><p>On the other hand, many problems can exist in a hierarchical
          structure. First, each manager can optimize his or her department to
          the detriment of the overall company. This happens because each
          functional team is part of a production chain required to deliver
          the product or service, but each team is managed independently. As
          each functional manager is focused on the efficiency of his or her
          team, the manager may not focus on the efficiency of the
          organization as a whole. For example, a functional team can push
          part of its work onto the next team by reducing the scope of what it
          delivers, completing it with poor quality, or completing 80 percent
          of the work and promising that the rest will come later. These
          tactics make it appear as though the team has completed a milestone
          on time so the statistics look good, but such approaches lower the
          overall efficiency of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1139"/>company.</p><p>In addition, work is often backed up in functional areas
          because of staff limitations, a non-project focus, and different
          priorities for different teams. For example, if five projects are
          active, but only two QA engineers are on staff, situations may occur
          when all five projects require the full-time attention of the two QA
          engineers at the same time. This results in the delay of three or
          more projects.</p><p>Finally, project communication between different functional
          areas is slower and less reliable, if it happens at all. Depending
          on the company culture, many inter-team discussions go up to the top
          of the hierarchy and then back down in another functional
          area.</p><p>With these key deficiencies in functional and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1140"/>hierarchical organizations, companies often use other
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1141"/>organizational structures. This is especially true in
          companies with large numbers of projects.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="matrix_organizations"/>Matrix Organizations</h2></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>matrix structure</em></span> solves some of the
          problems of a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1142"/>hierarchical structure. It supports project management
          as well as functional management. Both <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1143"/>project managers and functional managers have
          authority in their respective roles: the project manager for the
          project development, and the functional managers for supplying
          staff, mentoring the team, and setting processes and
          polices.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1144"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1145"/></p><p>Companies select a matrix structure based on many factors,
          including company size, company culture, and business requirements.
          Companies with less rigid cultures, many projects, and the need for
          speed often use a matrix structure. With the project managers
          driving the individual projects, efforts are less likely to stall
          out or fall into an "information hole."</p><p>Consider different variations of the authority given to the
          hierarchical management versus project management. One solution is
          to split the authority between the functional management and the
          project management in half. However, how much authority senior
          management gives <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1146"/>project managers versus functional managers varies
          considerably from <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1147"/>company to company. Project managers dominate at some
          companies, while executives give project managers little authority
          but all the responsibility at others. Authority can be split in a
          company with a cooperative culture, and this proves to be an
          effective combination.</p><p>The classic <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1148"/>matrix organizational chart shows split authority with
          dotted lines from the project managers. When drawn, the organization
          chart resembles a grid or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1149"/>matrix—hence the name. <a class="xref" href="apas06.html#example_of_a_matrix_organization" title="Figure A-4. Example of a matrix organization">Figure A-4</a> shows a sample matrix
          organization.</p><div class="figure"><a id="example_of_a_matrix_organization"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e16342"/><img alt="Example of a matrix organization" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266163.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure A-4. Example of a matrix organization</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Many effective methods can be used to split the authority of
          the functional manager from that of the project manager. One
          approach is to give the functional manager authority to set
          standards and choose staff. The functional manager defines how a
          project will be completed in general, sets the standards for
          success, and ensures that the projects are meeting a high standard.
          The project managers get to drive the projects with staff and focus
          on project success.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1150"/>Matrix organizations do have problems, however. Staff
          employees can get contradictory instructions from direct managers
          and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1151"/>project managers. Who is actually "the boss" is not
          always clear, which can lead to politics and infighting between
          project managers and functional managers if the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1152"/>company culture is pushy.</p><p>In addition, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1153"/>matrix organizations can lead to significant morale
          problems. If the functional managers have most of the authority,
          project managers may believe they have all the responsibility but no
          control and will be demoralized. The reverse situation can happen as
          well in companies that have strong project management but weak
          functional management.</p><p>Finally, projects often collide in functional groups—multiple
          projects need the same staff to meet their timelines, forcing each
          project manager to demand top priority for particular projects.
          Often, the functional manager must make the call on the priorities
          of competing projects. Project collision can be time consuming to
          resolve and avoid because of the defused authority. Priority
          discussions can be much more difficult in matrix companies than in
          hierarchical companies.</p><p>Neither matrix management nor hierarchical structures are
          ideal. Finding the right combination of functional and project
          control can work reasonably well. However, keeping development
          organizations as small as is practical and then giving them
          independence is often the best approach.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="small_product_team"/>Small Product Team</h2></div></div></div><p>One alternative to large hierarchical or functional
          organizations is the <span class="emphasis"><em>small product team</em></span>. The
          company organizes each product team around individual products and
          provides functional support for each. Management empowers the team
          to make all of the decisions about the product. In a 100-person
          company, the product team will be relatively small, and this is its
          advantage: It has scaled down a piece of the company to the small
          company structure.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1154"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm_d1e16387"/></p><p>Product teams excel at creating products that are
          revolutionary—products that break the existing models of how they
          are built and used. Developing products that are upgrades to
          existing ones works well in existing organizations; trying to build
          revolutionary products in the same product group will encounter
          roadblocks that will greatly impede progress, including limiting
          processes, working with older use models, being compelled in the
          overall profit/loss <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1155"/>structure, changing team attitudes toward risk, and
          creating problems related to change. Separating revolutionary
          product teams into their own product groups enables the new team to
          drive the new product area to success.</p><p><a class="xref" href="apas06.html#small_product_team-id001" title="Figure A-5. Small product team">Figure A-5</a> illustrates an
          example structure for the small product team. Note that the CEO
          splits off some functions to report directly to him or her.
          Typically, HR and Finance will still report directly to the CEO.
          Sometimes the CEO will also choose sales to be a corporate
          activity.</p><div class="figure"><a id="small_product_team-id001"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e16404"/><img alt="Small product team" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266165.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure A-5. Small product team</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The structure of product teams will vary: It can be
          functional, matrix, or flexible based on what the product manager
          wants. However, the team will include roles for sales, development,
          operations, marketing, and other product-related functions. Each
          product team consists of sufficient team members to handle all the
          functions needed for the product. This does not mean that the team
          consists of a team member from each functional discipline. A team
          member could handle more than one functional area, for example, such
          as programming and QA. In this structure, upper management works to
          define overall strategy and provides support as needed for each of
          the product teams. This approach works for software products that
          small- to medium-sized teams can create and support. Teams can
          create products effectively and with more enthusiasm because they
          have more control over their particular tasks. This approach avoids
          the prioritization and communication disadvantages of the functional
          or matrix organization and is favored by many team members.</p><p>The small product team approach can have disadvantages, too.
          It is often necessary to "overstaff" some areas to create the
          product teams, for example. A product line may require only
          one-third of a marketing person's time, but a full-time person is
          assigned. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1156"/>Small product teams can also have problems with
          coordinating their efforts with other product areas; this makes
          sense because each area was set up to optimize the product. In
          addition, cost savings may be missed through corporate purchasing of
          equipment and software, although this is a relatively small problem
          compared to the effectiveness advantages. Finally, once the team is
          set up, this method offers less flexibility in going after new
          product areas. To do so requires that a new team be formed, often by
          pulling people off existing successful product teams.</p><p>Overall, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1157"/>small product team's disadvantages are minor compared
          to the advantages of a more effective organization that can produce
          quality software quickly. The small product team works best for
          companies with relatively stable products planned over a
          multiple-year time frame.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="flexible_project_teams"/>Flexible Project Teams</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>flexible project teams</em></span> approach can
          make a team nimble. As projects arrive, management chooses project
          team leaders based on the projects' needs. The project leaders then
          select teams as projects require and as team members are available.
          Project team membership often overlaps, with one team member
          belonging to other teams as each project progresses. This approach
          requires a higher percentage of people with project leadership
          abilities than other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1158"/>organizational structures.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1159"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-A-1160"/></p><p>The flexible project team approach works very well in
          companies with many varying projects that are looking for speed and
          flexibility. Flexible teams are empowered as they provide the
          opportunity to form rapidly and allow team members to make project
          decisions directly.</p><p>The flexible project structure requires separating the
          non–project management functions from the project leadership. This
          can be accomplished in several ways, and <a class="xref" href="apas06.html#flexible_project_leadership" title="Figure A-6. Flexible project leadership">Figure A-6</a> illustrates one approach to
          separating the management functions of mentoring, coaching, and
          evaluating employees working on teams. While the project teams are
          flexible based on project need, the management structure stays in
          place as projects change. This allows employees to have a consistent
          relationship with their managers to work through long-term
          issues.</p><p>Management needs to handle process improvement in this
          organization as well. One approach is to assign the job to the
          managers who are working directly with employees. A good alternative
          is for management to assign flexible project teams to handle
          specific improvement tasks.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm_d1e16451"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="flexible_project_leadership"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e16457"/><img alt="Flexible project leadership" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266167.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure A-6. Flexible project leadership</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Like the others, this approach has disadvantages. A company
          that has few projects on a yearly basis can wind up with excessive
          management overhead. Also, it may be difficult to find enough
          engineers willing to be project team leads, although mid-career and
          senior engineers usually like the opportunity to lead on a part-time
          basis. Staff corrective action can also be more difficult with the
          diffused authority as compared to that in a functional-hierarchical
          organization.</p></div></div>

      complex than it might first appear. When thinking about
      internationalization, an engineering team's first instinct may be to
      focus on translating the program's English text into another

        offers customized applications in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model
        and hosts the applications on the company's servers. International

        invoicing customers in a timely fashion and asks you to investigate.
        She also tells you that some finger-pointing is going on between
        sales, operations, and accounts payable about who's to blame for the
        problem.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1191"/></p><p>You start by drawing a high-level diagram of your company,
        showing the main interactions between the functional areas. Your
        sketch looks like <a class="xref" href="apcs02.html#high-level_view_of_your_companys_major_w" title="Figure C-2. High-level view of your company's major workflow">Figure C-2</a>. With this
        drawing as your initial reference point, you can mark it up with the
        specific <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1192"/>workflow that you are investigating. In some cases, you
        can zoom in on specific details of a group and prune away functions
        that are not relevant to your problem.</p><p>To continue your investigation, you interview people involved in
        the complete order-build-invoice workflow. As you are talking to
        individuals, you sketch out the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1193"/>workflow in steps and ask each of them if you have
        properly captured each step.</p><div class="figure"><a id="high-level_view_of_your_companys_major_w"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e17042"/><img alt="High-level view of your company's major workflow" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266183.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure C-2. High-level view of your company's major workflow</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>First, you talk to the sales team; they tell you that they
        receive orders from the customer and send a copy of the order over to
        finance, the accounts billable group, engineering, and
        operations.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1194"/></p><p>Next, you talk with engineering and learn that they receive the
        orders and then create the web application, working with other teams.
        To complete an order, the engineering team needs to use the services
        of a translation vendor and the graphics team. Engineering also works
        with QA to complete the website. Engineering has to ask purchasing for
        translation vendor support. The translation vendor gets requests
        directly from your purchasing group in finance while finance's
        accounts payable team looks for payment.</p><p>Next, you talk to QA. QA tests the website and requests
        corrections from engineering. When QA determines that the website is
        acceptable, they send the information to operations for
        deployment.</p><p>Next you talk to operations team members, whose jobs seem cut
        and dried. Operations receives the website from QA and deploys it.
        Operations also lets accounts billable know when a website goes up,
        but because no particular order number is used in the process,
        operations sends over a general description of the site and a date
        deployed. As you are leaving the operations area, the operations
        manager also tells you that he gets no advance notice of orders and
        really has to scramble to schedule deployment work.</p><p>Finally, you talk with the accounts billable and accounts
        payable groups in finance. They tell a different story. Too often the
        accounts billable team has to ask sales for an order when it comes in.
        They also have difficulty understanding whom to bill when operations
        puts up a website, because they don't have a purchase order number
        from operations. So they have to call sales, operations, and sometimes
        engineering to figure it out.</p><p>All of this information is too confusing in the abstract, so you
        revise your high-level diagram to focus on the specifics of this
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1195"/>workflow. You revise your sketch to remove groups not
        involved and to add specific subgroups when appropriate. Then, you add
        actions to each group to illustrate what they do in the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-C-1196"/>workflow. Your diagram looks like <a class="xref" href="apcs02.html#example_order-build-invoice_workflow_dia" title="Figure C-3. Example order-build-invoice workflow diagram">Figure C-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="example_order-build-invoice_workflow_dia"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e17076"/><img alt="Example order-build-invoice workflow diagram" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266185.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure C-3. Example order-build-invoice workflow diagram</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>From the diagram, you can follow the workflow of the purchase
        order. With the diagram, it is easier to see that the gap occurs
        between sales, accounts billable, and operations. The diagram also
        makes it easier to experiment with potential solutions.</p><p>One approach is to get agreement from sales always to send order
        information to both accounts billable and operations. Operations now
        has the reference order number and some notice of the order being
        completed by engineering. Operations is then required to attached the
        order number to the deployment notice given to accounts payable.
        Operations will also be the backup check if it finds a web deployment
        but no corresponding order from sales—operations can talk to sales
        directly to request the order and have enough information to identify
