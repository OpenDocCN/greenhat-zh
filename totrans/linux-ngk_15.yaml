    pleasure- above-all-else, wild ride through the world of Linux, with barely a
    mention of anything suggestive of the workplace . . . or even of work, for that
    matter. I am, after all, trying to get you to see that Linux is a warm and fuzzy,
    fun and friendly operating system.
  prefs: []

    the desk. Linux can get down to business and do it as well as the next OS. I think
    it’s safe to say that you are missing nothing and are probably gaining quite a
    bit in terms of home and office productivity programs in the world of Linux. In
    this chapter, I’ll walk you through the Linux offerings in this department.

- en: Whether they should be or not, people are quite obsessed with office suites,
    even though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The de facto standard
    among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in both the Windows
    and Macintosh worlds. Of course, as it is a Microsoft product, you can be quite
    sure that there is no Linux version available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, Linux does have an exceedingly capable office suite in the form
    of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in “free”)
    in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some lightweight sour-
    grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a full-featured
    contender, and in some cases, such as its onscreen font rendering, OpenOffice.org
    is a clear winner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like most other office suites, OpenOffice.org consists of a word processor,
    a spreadsheet program, a presentation program, and a couple of other programs.
    The main three applications are compatible with their Microsoft Office equivalents
    (Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, respectively) in terms of both reading
    and writing files, and as the basic look and feel of these applications is fairly
    similar to Microsoft Office, switching over to the OpenOffice.org applications
    should be relatively easy. If you don’t have any experience with Microsoft Office,
    you should still find it all pretty straightforward, as the basic layout is pretty
    intuitive. And if you are lacking in the intuition department, the built-in help
    files are pretty good, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get OpenOffice.org up and running, launch the application you wish to use
    (I’d recommend the word processor for now) by going to the Main menu, selecting
    **Office**, and then selecting the office application of your choice. Remember
    that the launchers for the word processor and spreadsheet should still be on your
    panel too.

    Once you have done that, a copy of the image will immediately appear in the Gallery

    can be used for everyday tasks too, such as projecting house- hold budgets, calculating
    grade point averages (for teacher or student), figuring out how long it will take
    you to save up for your trip to Hungary, or even for something as weird as comparing
    the seat heights for the four or five motorcycles you are trying to choose among.

    you are sending it to another Linux user (Linux and Mac users should actually
    be able to deal with either type of archive). Once you’ve done that, click **OK**,
    and the still-empty archive will be created.

- en: The easiest way to fill your archive with files is to just drag the files you
    want to the File Roller window of your new archive. You can add the files one
    by one, or you can add them by dragging and dropping an entire folder. Once you
    do this, File Roller will archive the files, and the new additions will appear
    in the File Roller window (see [Figure 15-12](#figure.DDU165)). Oh, and don’t
    worry, your original files will still be where they were — safe and untouched.

    and send your archived file to your friend. Note, however, that sometimes when
    the first item you drag to the archive is a folder, it will not appear in the
    archive window until you add yet another file, even though it is in fact there.
    This is a quirk in File Roller, but it is just superficial, so if the only item
    you are going to archive is a folder, worry not. You cannot save an empty archive,
    so if your archive appears in your folder or subfolders, you know you were successful.

- en: While we are still dealing with the serious side of things, we might as well
    make brief mention of viruses. It is true that most of the viruses that make the
    news are aimed at Windows systems and make use of Windows versions of Outlook
    and Outlook Express email clients to spread themselves far and wide. This does
    not mean, however, that Linux is immune to viruses. Because many Linux users think
    that viruses only happen to Windows, Linux systems are often unprotected and are
    an attractive potential target, especially as the number of Linux users continues
    to grow. There is also always the possibility that your system may be used a way
    station of sorts, passing a virus from someone else to one of your associates
    (and guess who’ll get the blame). So, while you really don’t have too much to
    worry about yet, it is always better to be safe than sorry.

    applications for Windows is far greater than the number for Linux. Of these Linux
    applications, many are somewhat cumbersome for the beginner to use, and most require
    you to pay for the right to use them. One program, called F-Prot Antivirus, by
    an Icelandic company called Frisk Software International ([www.f-prot.com](http://www.f-prot.com)),
    however, is available for free for “personal users on personal workstations.”
    If you are part of the readership I had in mind, then this means that F-Prot Antivirus
    is free for you. F-Prot Antivirus comes as an RPM file and is thus very easy to
    install. It is also very easy to use, even though it is run from the Linux Command
    Terminal and, thus, has no graphical interface.

- en: Before using F-Prot Antivirus, it is probably best that you update its virus
    database so that you can catch the newest of the viral meanies. To do this, you
    use an update script that is installed along with F-Prot Antivirus. Open a Terminal
    window, become root with the **su** command, type /usr/local/f-prot/tools/check-updates.pl,
    and press ENTER. The script will then contact the F-Prot server, check for updated
    virus information, download whatever there is available, and then install it —
    while, of course, telling you everything it is doing along the way.
  prefs: []

- en: Once you have updated the virus database, you are ready to use F-Prot Antivirus.
    As I already mentioned, F-Prot Antivirus is command driven, but the commands themselves
    are quite simple. The basic command structure consists of the main command, **f-prot**,
    plus the directory or files you want to scan. For example, if you want to scan
    your entire hard disk to see if you have any viruses there, you first become root,
    and then type f-prot / and press ENTER. F-Prot then scans your entire hard disk
    to check for known viruses. This will probably take, depending on the speed of
    your system and the number of files on it, around 30 minutes, so you had better
    do it while having lunch. When the scanning is complete, F-Prot Antivirus will
    show you its results, as in [Figure 15-13](#figure.DDU166).

    it took to do so, how many of those files were suspicious (meaning files that
    seemed odd to F-Prot, but did not match up with any known virus in the database),
    and how many were actually infected.

- en: One of the problems with the simple command string used in the previous example
    is that F-Prot Antivirus will give you no feedback while it is doing its business
    — you will see nothing in the Terminal until F-Prot is finished, it displays its
    results, and your user prompt reappears. I find this a bit disconcerting, so I
    prefer to add the **-list** flag to the **f-prot** command, which makes F-Prot
    show you every file it is scanning while it is doing so. This reassures you that
    F-Prot is doing what it is supposed to be doing (and gives you some indication
    of its progress).
