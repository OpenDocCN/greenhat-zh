    off-putting enough. The words *compile* and *source* seem to instill a sense of
    foreboding in the heart of the new user. That certainly was the case for me, anyway.
  prefs: []

    In fact, now that you have some experience in using the Terminal and command line,

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to understand what *source* is, you should understand a bit about how
    a program actually gets from its primitive state on the programmer’s computer
    to an up-and-running application on your machine. First the programmer writes
    a program in a programming language. You have probably heard of programming languages
    such as Basic or C, and there are many others. What the programmer actually writes
    with such a language is a set of instructions called the *source code*, or *source*.
    Your computer, however, cannot actually understand any of that source on its own.
    It is as if the computer speaks ancient Greek, and the source code is all written
    in French. The computer therefore needs some sort of interpreter to help it out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The various languages that programmers use are called *high-level languages*
    — they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, on the other
    hand, only understands what are called *low-level languages*, which are quite
    difficult for most mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the high-level
    language instructions to a low-level language, the computer needs some other program
    to translate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be done while a program is running, in which case the translator program
    is called an *interpreter*. Applications that run using an interpreter are usually
    called *scripts*. The pyWings application in [Chapter 9](DDU0068_split_000.html#372)
    is an example of such a script application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with such script applications is that they can be slower, because
    the computer must run an interpreter, interpret the source code, and run the actual
    application all at the same time. This is like having a French book translated
    to a Greek speaker by a live interpreter — very slow indeed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an alternative, many programs use a *compiler* instead of an interpreter.
    A compiler translates the high-level source code into low-level *machine code*,
    or *object code*, that the computer can understand before the application is actually
    run. Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother with the
    high- level instructions again; it can merely read the translated version each
    and every time it runs the program. This is like reading a translated version
    of a foreign book that you can read any time you want to without assistance. Because
    computers can run compiled programs without simultaneously using an interpreter,
    compiled programs run faster. Most applications for all operating systems are,
    therefore, compiled.

- en: Almost all source packages come in the form of tarballs (tarballs and RPM files
    are both referred to as *packages,* which is why the icon for such files looks
    like a little parcel-post box). Tarballs, like ZIP files on Windows systems or
    StuffIt files on the Mac, consist of a group of files, or even a single file,
    which have been compressed into one space-saving archive file. In Linux, the most
    common method of creating such archives is through the tar program, from which
    the tarball gets its name. Tar files, or tarballs, can be recognized by their
    file endings, which are .tar.gz or tar.bz2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may or may not realize it, but you have already used tarballs in two of
    the previous chapters. In [Chapter 5](DDU0040_split_000.html#213) you dragged
    tarballs into your Theme Preferences window to install new window borders and
    control sets, and in [Chapter 9](DDU0068_split_000.html#372) you untarred a tarball
    (extracted the archived files) in order to set up and use the pyWings application.
    The files archived in tarballs can be extracted by using the command line, but
    to keep things easy, you can just use the simple double- click method that you
    used in [Chapter 9](DDU0068_split_000.html#372).

    be working with a game called Xmahjongg. Now, you may think that, as you already
    have a GNOME mahjongg game and a KDE mahjongg game (not listed in the Main menu)
    installed on your system, having yet another mahjongg game is a tad redundant,
    to say the least. Maybe so, but in terms of gaming, the Xmahjongg game is easier
    on the eyes and snappier in performance. It looks prettier too, in my opinion.

    tiles that are open to one side. When you click the two matching open tiles, they

    it is a good idea to copy the makefile to the desktop. Then, once you are done

- en: You could simply run XPenguins by typing xpenguins in the Run Command window
    or the Command Terminal, but if you did that, getting rid of your new, pesky little
    friends would be more of a chore. Instead, add the XPenguins applet, which you’ve
    just compiled, to the GNOME Panel by right-clicking the Panel and selecting **Add
    to Panel** > **Amusements** > **XPenguins** in the pop-up menu. If XPenguins doesn’t
    appear in the menu straightaway, try again the next time you restart your machine.

    the penguins by clicking the top button, and then send them back where they came
    from by clicking the bottom button. A very convenient arrangement, to be sure.

- en: If you like the concept of XPenguins, but not the penguins themselves, right-
    click the XPenguins Panel applet and select **Properties** in the pop-up menu.
    In the Properties window, click the **Themes** tab, and you will find a few non-
    penguin alternatives. If none of these satisfies you, you can go back to the XPenguins
    project page and download an additional package that contains several cartoon-character
    themes, such as the Simpsons. The theme package is available as a tarball, but
    for convenience’s sake, just download the RPM file **xpenguins_themes-1.0-1.noarch.rpm**
    and install it.
