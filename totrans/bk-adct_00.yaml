    and mixer for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It comes packaged in easy-to-use installers
    for Mac OS X and all versions of Windows, and Linux users will find it in the
    software repositories of their favorite Linux distributions. Visit [http://audacity.sourceforge.net/](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)

- en: In this book, we’ll be using Audacity 1.3.12 (and newer) on Ubuntu Studio and
    Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7\. The stable 2.0 release will appear
    soon and should look very much like what you see in this book because the 1.3.*xx*
    series is the run-up to 2.*x*. This book is based on the very latest releases
    as they came out, so it is as current as any book can be. The 1.3.*xx* Audacity
    releases are considerably advanced from the old 1.2.*x* series. Every new release
    is full of wonderful improvements and bug fixes, so if you’re still using those
    old 1.2.*x* versions, you should consider upgrading.

    percent Ubuntu-compatible, and it uses the standard Ubuntu software repositories.
    You can download Ubuntu Studio or simply add the Ubuntu Studio packages and artwork
    to any Ubuntu installation. There are several excellent multimedia Linux distributions,
    which you can read about in [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Configuring Linux
    for Best Audio Quality"). You can use any Linux version you like; a few important
    system modifications you may need to make are covered in [Chapter 13](ch13.html
    "Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality").

    XP, Vista, and Windows 7.

    format, and it does not support MIDI. While it is wonderful for making mono and
    stereo recordings, it is not quite as good at making multichannel surround sound
    recordings.

    projects. In [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish"),
    we’ll plug a microphone into a computer and learn the basics of recording, editing,
    playback, and Audacity controls. We’ll also learn some important digital audio
    terminology and concepts. If you are new to digital audio production or new to
    Audacity, you should go through this chapter first.

- en: Another popular audio recording application for Linux (and Mac OS X) is Ardour,
    which calls itself a digital audio workstation. Ardour aims to meet the needs
    of professionals and competes with the likes of ProTools, Nuendo, Pyramix, and
    other expensive commercial audio applications. It has a more sophisticated mixer
    than Audacity and some nice audio-for-video tools. It has advanced dubbing abilities,
    synchronizes with MIDI sequencers, and supports control surfaces, which are hardware
    devices for controlling your software mixers. It has more automation, as well
    as a number of useful real-time features such as changing plug-ins on the fly
    and moving samples to different tracks or timelines while they are playing.

    free software because they are licensed under the GPL, both are excellent, and
    both are getting better all the time. For complex multitrack mixing or precise
    video soundtrack synchronization, go with Ardour. For recording long tracks such
    as live shows, converting LPs and tapes to digital formats, cleaning up files
    marred by hiss or hum or other defects, making podcasts, making simple video soundtracks,
    and recording in the field, Audacity is an excellent, quality application with
    a short learning curve and a lot of useful and advanced features.
