I’ve written for every kind of publication, ranging from countless print articles and magazine columns to website musings and multiple books. In 2001, I wrote about how Linux and GIMP were starting to make waves in the special-effects industry with the article “Linux Goes to the Movies” in <span class="emphasis"><em>Salon.com</em></span>. Open source has come a long way since then. And so has GIMP.</p><p>When GIMP was first started as a class project at the University of California, Berkeley, it was built on top of the venerable Motif toolkit, which at the time was really the only full-featured software library for X11-based windowing systems. Version 0.54 was my first taste of the GIMP in this form. Later, the GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) was born, and it replaced Motif for various technical reasons. Somewhere between version 0.54 and version 0.99, I ported John Beale’s Sparkle code to a GIMP plug-in. For that ancient yet still meaningful work, I’m listed as a contributor to the project. It even got me into the Red Hat “friends and family” plan when they had their IPO (I should’ve sold when it was at its peak—silly me). Eventually, my association with the project led me to write for the <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> and later <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, the latter of which led to my first book on GIMP, in fact <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> first book on GIMP, called <span class="emphasis"><em>The Artists’ Guide to the GIMP</em></span>. You might say I’ve followed Linux and GIMP from day one.</p><p>Of course, after all these years I’m no longer the only one writing on this subject, and GIMP is no longer just a class project. Plenty of texts exist that show you which button opens which dialog. In the first edition of this book, I hoped to go where no one else had attempted, beyond the application itself and into what it can do. In this second edition, I’m updating the old tutorials, tossing in some new ones, and giving you a look at how GIMP is evolving.</p><p>Linux and GIMP have grown up together, and they are no longer youngsters in the computing world. Linux comes with a serious desktop, and GIMP is a serious application. It’s time to get down to business: the business of graphic design. This book is about learning techniques applicable to the real world.</p><div class="sect1" title="What This Book Is About"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_this_book_is_about"/>What This Book Is About</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is about process, not buttons or menu paths. My goal is to show you that the processes required to perform a task can be done with GIMP as easily as with any other graphics editor. It isn’t the tool that’s important, it’s understanding the process. It’s far easier to grasp that a mask is a black region blocking out a section of an image than it is to find a use for an alpha channel and a black background. Don’t get bogged down in the mechanics of the tool. Focus on the task at hand. I’ll point you to the GIMP components necessary to finish the job. By the time you’re done with these tutorials, you won’t need any more pointing.</p><p>If you can’t find a dialog referenced in the text, just open the Dockable Dialogs menu, available from the Windows menu. Clicking a menu entry jumps to that dialog quickly if it’s already open or opens it if necessary.</p><p>This book was written during the development of GIMP 2.8, so it’s most relevant to that particular version of GIMP. But I’ve tried to keep my advice general enough that the book remains useful even as newer versions of GIMP are released.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What This Book Is Not About"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_this_book_is_not_about"/>What This Book Is Not About</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you won’t find manual pages for each filter, menu, or feature. I won’t be explaining each icon you find or why some dialogs look like they do. Instead, the tutorials presented here show how to use filters as if they were a set of tools in a toolbox. You seldom need just a hammer for a project. GIMP provides the hammer, the saw, the drill, even the kitchen sink. With this book, I hope you’ll learn to use all the tools in the toolbox.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How This Book Is Organized"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_this_book_is_organized"/>How This Book Is Organized</h1></div></div></div><p>The book has six chapters, each consisting of multiple tutorials. Each chapter covers a different area of graphic design: Fundamental Techniques, Photographic Effects, Web Design, Advertising and Special Effects, Type Effects, and Creative Inspiration (advanced projects). Each tutorial opens with introductory material on the subject at hand and includes a set of tips related to that area of design.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Techniques">Chapter 1</a> provides a set of core tips laid out in an introductory fashion, from the toolbox to common tasks like drawing and text manipulation. Users new to GIMP should read this chapter thoroughly, while more advanced users may glance through it or skip it altogether. Each tutorial after <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Techniques">Chapter 1</a> is an independent project, so try to find a project that strikes your fancy. These tutorials can be completed in any order.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Photographic Effects">Chapter 2</a> is for photographers. GIMP’s raster processing is ideal for working with photographs and stock imagery. The number of effects you can create is limitless, but this chapter will help you get started with some often-used photographic techniques.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Web Design">Chapter 3</a> is all about graphic design for the Web. In many areas of the Web, static images still play key roles. Features like background images, menus and buttons, and logos are all part and parcel of everyday GIMP work.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Advertising and Special Effects">Chapter 4</a> will take you to the world of advertising design and special effects. In this chapter, you’ll find techniques to create 2-D and 3-D designs for products ranging from posters to cell phones to underwater adventures.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Type Effects">Chapter 5</a> covers type effects. GIMP is wonderful at turning boring fonts into fantastic logos and 3-D designs. This chapter will walk you through re-creating some commonly used text effects.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Creative Inspiration">Chapter 6</a> is new to this edition of the book. It provides several advanced tutorials whose primary purpose is to inspire you to new creative heights. Use this chapter as your springboard to advanced use of GIMP.</p><p>Each tutorial starts with a project summary, accompanied by reasons for using the technique. The tutorials are designed to allow you to quickly re-create them step by step using the default tools and features that come with GIMP.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="A Few More Hints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="few_more_hints"/>A Few More Hints</h1></div></div></div><p>I won’t be referencing keyboard shortcuts very often—with a few exceptions like Select All (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-A) or Deselect All (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A)—because GIMP allows you to customize the shortcuts any way you like. Instead, I’ll reference the default menu locations where necessary. If the feature has a keyboard shortcut, it’ll be listed next to that option in the menu. Learn those to speed your work through these tutorials.</p><p>Note that the use of the <span class="smaller">CTRL</span> and <span class="smaller">ALT</span> keys are shown as they’re used with Linux. Users of Windows or Mac can map these keystrokes to their appropriate platform equivalents.</p><p>Also note that key presses for the keyboard are always listed with uppercase letters to make the key sequence easier to read. Unless <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span> is specifically listed with the keystroke, the <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span> key need not be used.</p><div class="sect2" title="A Useful Package"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="useful_package"/>A Useful Package</h2></div></div></div><p>GIMP Paint Shop (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/">http://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/</a></em></span>) is a package providing additional brushes, palettes, patterns, and excellent tool presets that provide simulated artist’s tools and techniques. It’s a must-have if you plan on taking your GIMP skills to the next level.</p><p>You can check out more ways to extend the power of GIMP at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://registry.gimp.org">registry.gimp.org</a></em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="About the Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="about_the_canvas"/>About the Canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>Unless otherwise noted, assume a default canvas size of 640 × 400 pixels to make the tutorials easier to produce on slower systems. This size works fine on the Web, but you’ll need to scale up the process if you intend to use a technique for a print project: increase the amount of blur, adjust the number of pixels to offset a layer, and so forth. The thing to remember in each tutorial is the basic set of steps: add text, blur, offset a layer, duplicate and rotate, and so on. The amount of each of these varies with the scale of the project, and print projects tend to use significantly larger canvases than the default 640 × 400 pixel, 72 dpi canvas used in these tutorials.</p><p>Be sure <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to create the project at the default canvas size and then try to scale it up at the end! Doing so produces grainy, unsuitable results.</p><p>In this book, the terms <span class="emphasis"><em>canvas</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>image window</em></span> are interchangeable. The official GIMP documentation refers to the main drawing area as an image window. I like to use <span class="emphasis"><em>canvas</em></span> because the term <span class="emphasis"><em>image</em></span> is somewhat overused—it can mean more than one thing, depending on context. Besides, artists work on a canvas. They produce images. It just makes sense to me.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
