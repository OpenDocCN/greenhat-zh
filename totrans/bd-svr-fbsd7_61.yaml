- en: Samba is an open source implementation of the SMB (Server Message Block) and
    CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocols, which are used for sharing files
    and printers over a Microsoft network. Samba was created to provide Windows-compatible
    file and printer sharing services with UNIX-like systems.

- en: SMB was originally developed to run atop the NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output
    System) protocol. However, because NetBIOS was conceived for small networks, it
    lacked routing capabilities, which limited SMB to local area networks. In 1996,
    Microsoft modified SMB so that it would not rely on NetBIOS, and renamed it Common
    Internet File System (CIFS). With the release of Windows 2000, SMB/CIFS was able
    to run atop TCP/IP.

- en: Samba shares appear just like other shared folders in a Windows network. Access
    privileges can be cascaded over the normal Unix file permissions, and configurable
    restrictions based on login may be implemented as well. Unix users may also mount
    and access shares with the Samba client, which is similar to an FTP client. Samba
    consists of two daemons, namely smbd and nmbd. The SMB daemon handles file and
    print services as well as authentication. The NMB daemon handles name resolution
    and file browsing capability.

- en: Dr. Barry Feigenbaum of IBM developed the SMB protocol in the early '80s as
    a solution for building small local area networks. Microsoft later built on the
    original SMB foundation and became the dominant user of the technology. Andrew
    Tridgell developed Samba in 1992 by reverse-engineering the SMB protocol to fit
    his needs. The Samba project is now a multi-national team and continues to develop
    new features.
