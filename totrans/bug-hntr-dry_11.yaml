  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ASLR randomizes the location of key areas of a process space (usually the base
    address of the executable, the position of the stack, the heap, the libraries,
    and others) to prevent an exploit writer from predicting target addresses. Say
    you find a *write4 primitive* vulnerability that presents you with the opportunity
    to write 4 bytes of your choosing to any memory location you like. That gives
    you a powerful exploit if you choose a stable memory location to overwrite. If
    ASLR is in place, it’s much harder to find a reliable memory location to overwrite.
    Of course, ASLR is effective only if it’s implemented correctly.^([[100](apcs03.html#ftn.APP-C-FN-1)])

    the function’s metadata associated with procedure invocation (e.g., the return
    address). Before the return address is processed, the validity of the cookie or
    canary is checked, and the data in the stack frame is reorganized to protect the
    pointers and arguments of the function. If you find a stack buffer overflow in
    a function that is protected by this mitigation technique, exploitation can be
    tough.^([[101](apcs03.html#ftn.APP-C-FN-2)])

- en: The *No eXecute (NX)* bit is a CPU feature that helps prevent code execution
    from data pages of a process. Many modern operating systems take advantage of
    the NX bit. Under Microsoft Windows, hardware-enforced *Data Execution Prevention
    (DEP)* enables the NX bit on compatible CPUs and marks all memory locations in
    a process as nonexecutable unless the location explicitly contains executable
    code. DEP was introduced in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1\. Under
    Linux, NX is enforced by the kernel on 64-bit CPUs of AMD and Intel. ExecShield^([[102](apcs03.html#ftn.APP-C-FN-3)])

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mitigations can be controlled by system policy, by special APIs, and by compile-time
    options. For example, the default system-wide DEP policy for Windows client–operating
    systems is called OptIn. In this mode of operation, DEP is enabled only for processes
    that explicitly opt in to DEP. There are different ways to opt a process in to
    DEP. For example, you could use the appropriate linker switch (/NXCOMPAT) at compile
    time, or you could use the `SetProcessDEPPolicy` API to allow an application to
    opt in to DEP programmatically. Windows supports four system-wide configurations
    for hardware-enforced DEP.^([[104](apcs03.html#ftn.APP-C-FN-5)]) On Windows Vista
    and later, you can use the *bcdedit.exe* console application to verify the system-wide
    DEP policy, but this must be done from an elevated Windows command prompt. To
    verify the DEP and ASLR settings of an application, you can use Sysinternals’s
    Process Explorer.^([[105](apcs03.html#ftn.APP-C-FN-6)])
