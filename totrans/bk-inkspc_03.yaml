    in Inkscape in a serious way. From here on, we will explore practical topics at
    a maximum level of detail, leaving no stone unturned. It is impossible to predict
    what features or techniques you will find most useful; this depends a lot on the
    nature of your work and your personal tastes. That’s why this book tries to cover
    absolutely everything Inkscape has to offer.

    the program’s capabilities and better adapt it to the way you prefer to work.
    Before you begin using Inkscape for anything of consequence, therefore, let’s
    see how and where all the various preferences are set and stored in Inkscape.

    To create a new document, Inkscape simply makes a copy of a template. Usually
    a template is empty but it can contain any objects, as well as show any snapping
    grids or guidelines. Inkscape ships with a collection of templates for standard
    paper sizes, standard icon and web banner sizes, desktop sizes (for wallpapers),
    CD/DVD covers, and business cards. For example, here is the template for a 16-by-16
    pixel icon (to create a website’s favicon), with pixel grid enabled:'

    point than the default empty canvas can be turned into a template. For this, just
    copy or save the document to the user templates directory, which is *~/.config/inkscape/templates*
    on Unix and *share/templates* inside the Inkscape application data directory (*Documents
    and Settings\<your login>\Application Data\Inkscape*) on Windows. If this directory
    does not yet exist, create it. In the **Save** dialog in Inkscape, there’s a shortcut
    in the left pane called **templates**; double-clicking it takes you to that directory
    (this shortcut is not available on Windows).

    for your custom template. For example, the default template is called *default.svg*;
    if you save a file under that name in your template directory, it will be used
    as the base for all new documents created when you run Inkscape or press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735406.png.jpg).

    (Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Xara Xtreme, Macromedia Freehand) as well as for
    some minor vector editors (Zoner Draw, ACD Systems Canvas). The file *right-handed-illustration.xml*
    is a variant of the standard layout which places the most often used commands
    under the left hand so you can avoid lifting your right hand from the mouse or
    tablet.

    corresponding file over *default.xml* and restarting Inkscape. Note that the alternative

    these alternative layouts or adding new ones will be appreciated by the developers.

    you can use outside-the-page canvas as clipboard or work area, but then place

    also ignores everything outside the page. Bitmap export, however, can take either
    the page, or the actual drawing (all objects), or just the selected objects no

    For example, you may be working on a collection of icons or logos, all in the
    same SVG file, not intending to share the SVG but exporting each icon to a separate
    bitmap file. In that case, the rectangle of the page is just a distraction. The
    page border controls at the bottom of the **Document Properties** dialog allow
    you to change the color and shadow of this rectangle or just hide it altogether.
    You can also place the border on top of the drawing so it remains visible over
    any objects that might otherwise obscure the edges of the page.

    choice makes window geometry a global rather than per-document preference, so
    that the whenever you change the size or position of any Inkscape window, this
    geometry is then applied to all subsequently opened windows. The last choice—per-document
    window geometry—is the default.

    directory; the maximized state of the window will be saved with it, and all newly

    is inconvenient. The simplest way to zoom in by mouse is by pressing the middle
    button (on many mice, this is not actually a button but a scroll-wheel that you
    can click as well as rotate). The point you click will keep its relative position
    in the window after the zoom, so by clicking some small object, you zoom into
    that object—unlike the plus sign and minus sign key zoom, which zooms into the
