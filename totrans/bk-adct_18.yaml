- en: There are a number of persistent, silly audio myths that refuse to die. The
    funny part is that a few blind listening tests would disprove them, or as the
    old geek saying goes, “One experiment is worth a thousand arguments.” Here are
    my favorites.

- en: Some audiophiles love to obsess over specs and are convinced that, yes, they
    too can hear super-high frequencies just like bats, and the super-low frequencies
    just like whatever animal hears super-low frequencies, and they need every last
    possible hertz, and it must be filtered through special organic electricity or
    their listening experience is ruined. Their equipment must be elite and overpriced,
    and the Sacred Listening Room must be specially engineered. They are more sensitive
    than ordinary mortals, and we just don’t appreciate what they go through.

    a proven way to sell overpriced gear. These salespeople and reviewers don’t have
    any special hearing abilities, just acute sensitivities to the smell of money.

- en: Of course, it is true that hearing acuity and perception vary among individual
    people, but in any random assortment of humans with good, undamaged hearing, the
    differentiator is how *educated* their ears are. This is true of all of our senses—when
    you know what to look for, you become an ace birdwatcher. When you learn to differentiate
    different flavors, aromas, and characteristics in wine, it becomes a multifaceted
    pleasure instead of just an easy, pleasant buzz. Experienced riders learn how
    to interpret all the signals a horse gives—mood, intent, what’s ahead—and how
    to communicate back to the horse. Just like everything else we do, listening is
    a learning process. You might start out unable to tell the difference between
    a viola and a violin, but with experience you learn to identify the individual
    musicians in a band or orchestra. Even when it’s the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone
    Quartet. That’s right, four saxophone players and nothing else; two alto, one
    tenor, and one baritone sax. To the inexperienced ear, it’s just a blur of saxophones,
    but with a bit of listening, you can tell right away who is playing what.

    studios, and they sure as heck didn’t have super-duper hi-fi playback devices.
    The best recordings from the olden days feature talented, skilled musicians and
    talented, skilled engineers who knew how to get the most out of their equipment.
    If specs are all that matter, we might as listen to pure sine waves. There are
    no shortcuts to spending time listening, comparing, experimenting, and learning
    to *listen*.

- en: This is another one that deserves a wooden stake through its vitals. Audio electronics
    and speakers sound the same when they’re brand-new as they do after decades of
    use, barring damage and component failure. Giving them a period of “burn-in,”
    which is simply switching them on and then leaving them on for whatever magic
    burn-in interval is required, is silly and does nothing to change how they sound.

    a new amp sounds “cold” and, after 24 hours or whatever, sounds “warm.” ’Taint
    so; it’s all the same. There are many things that affect how we perceive sounds:
    temperature, humidity, mood, whether we are rested or tired, whether we have been
    in a quiet or noisy environment all day. Audio electronics are pretty much always
    the same.'

- en: Tube amps are obsolete. Solid-state does everything they can do, cheaper and
    better and with less distortion. Tube amps need more service over their lifetimes
    because tubes burn out and lose power, and you might even need to re-tension their
    sockets. You’ve probably heard lyrical odes to the “tube sound.” Tube amps are
    perfectly good for those who prefer them. If there is a “tube sound” that you
    like, it is most likely distortion created by the amp. If you want your amps to
    be neutral and reproduce your audio as accurately as possible, you want solid-state.

- en: You’re welcome to spend significant wads of money on cables if you really want
    to. You’ll probably get more enjoyment out of papering your walls with dollar
    bills, lighting cigars with twenties, or making stylish garments out of Ben Franklins,
    because spending gobs of money on audio cables does not make them better than
    sensibly priced cables. You’ll want to avoid weird, cruddy, no-name brands, but
    otherwise any cable that is manufactured to the appropriate specifications is
    equal to any other. Look for good construction, strong connectors, good insulation,
    and specs and identifying information printed on the sheaths. Sometimes there
    are useful options like right-angle plugs or swivel plugs. If you want to waste
    your money, do please pick something more worthy than overpriced audio cables.

    resistance. They don’t make the sound better.

- en: Analog audio cannot compete with digital audio for fidelity; signal-to-noise
    ratio; lack of distortion; and ease of editing, manipulation, and reproduction.
    Some folks like analog artifacts such as the “fat” sound of pushing analog circuits
    to their limits, distortion, feedback, and so on. No worries, everyone is entitled
    to their preferences. Though it’s worth noting these can be reproduced in digital
    audio.

- en: This one really gets my goat. You enter the high-end snooty audio store to try
    out some high-quality equipment. Hey, why not, you won’t know until you listen
    to it, right? You are escorted to The Room of Acoustic Perfection. There you are
    seated in the precisely positioned Listening Chair, in front of banks of speakers,
    amps, preamps, no receivers because those are not snooty enough, and high-end
    CD players. These are all connected to a switching system so that you can easily
    try out different combinations. Very nice so far. Your salesperson will be into
    something above the common herd; perhaps jazz, maybe some classical, maybe some
    off-the-wall independent labels. Certainly no Top 40 or teenybop pop.

- en: So on goes the music, and you sink back into pleasant bliss. But as you listen,
    you notice it’s not quite right. You want a little less treble, perhaps, and a
    little more bass. Maybe the midrange is a touch wimpy and you want to kick it
    up a tick or two. Tough luck, buster, because those fine amps only control volume
    and balance. You don’t get tone controls. Why? Because, as the salesperson explains,
    real audiophiles listen to the music as it is “meant to be listened to.” So no
    tone controls for you, and if you want any, then you are defective. Though not
    too defective to drop a few thousand dollars on a hi-fi system with no tone controls;
    fortunately, the salesperson is magnanimous and will permit you to do that.

    all of them are compromises. Because even the best-engineered recordings are not
    proof against the environments they are played in or the individual characteristics
    of your hi-fi components. They will sound different depending what they are played
    on, the rooms they are played in, temperature and humidity, your moods—every day
    it’s a little different, and God gave us tone controls so we could hear recordings
    the way we want to. Maybe you have some big bad feelings to work off and need
    some aggressive subwoofering. Maybe you want it light and soothing. Maybe you
    just like to twiddle knobs. That is your right, and you must not allow pretentious
    salespersons to take it away from you.

- en: For the most part, fussy audiophiles are fussy about all the wrong things. There
    are two categories of people who can teach you actual useful knowledge, and those
    are musicians and recording engineers. I mean real musicians and real recording
    engineers, not wannabes who think that when the knob goes to 11 it means the amp
    is louder than amps that go to 10\. Recording engineers are just as much artists
    as engineers, and even mediocre ones can teach you a lot about the nuts and bolts
    of making recordings.

    decision about what is good is entirely yours. You have to learn to train your
    own ear and taste and not depend on what other people tell you because they don’t
    experience audio the same way you do. Especially if they’re trying to sell you
    something.
