- en: A cleaning lady discovered a scuff mark on the floor of the machine room and
    decided to remove it. First she tried wax, then an ammonia-based cleaner, and
    finally, as a last resort, steel wool. The combination proved deadly. Not for
    the scuff mark, but for the computers.

    down. Opening the cabinets, they discovered massive shorts in all the circuit
    boards.

- en: What had happened? The cleaning lady first applied a coating of wax to the floor.
    The ammonia vaporized the wax, which was sucked into the computers by the cooling
    fans. Thus every board was coated with an even layer of sticky wax. That wasn't
    too bad, but next came the steel wool. The steel fibers were sucked into the machine
    where they stuck to the wax coating on the inside of the machine.
