- en: A significant psychological barrier to getting started in hardware hacking is
    the perceived unavailability of hacking tools. While Radio Shack stocks a small
    supply of components and tools, the components are expensive and most of the tools
    are difficult to use with today’s miniaturized components. This appendix lists
    a few of the component and tool vendors that have a solid selection at reasonable
    prices. This appendix also includes Jameco order numbers for the basic tools required
    to do the projects in this book. You can enter these order numbers directly into
    Jameco’s secure ordering website to help get you started quickly.

- en: There are a wide variety of component and equipment distributors, from those
    that cater primarily to large businesses, to those that service individuals, hobbyists,
    and repairmen. You may experience some frustration when dealing with a distributor
    that caters to large businesses. These distributors service high-volume accounts,
    so accounts are serviced by a designated sales representative. As a result, it
    may be difficult to get a comprehensive catalog of parts or pricing and inventory
    information for small orders. The vendors listed in this section are friendly
    to individual orders and the their collective inventory will stock most of the
    parts you will ever need.

    to get you geared up for hacking. The “basic” order form contains all the bits
    and drivers necessary for opening up an Xbox, as well as some basic soldering
    tools. The “advanced” order form contains a set of tools and utilities that are
    useful to have on hand, but are expensive enough that those on a budget may consider
    ordering them only as they require them.

    necessary to disassemble an Xbox, including the T-10, T-15, and T-20 torx bits.
    I have included the 1/32” conical bevel tip in the order form above because the
    soldering iron comes with a horrendously large 1/8” chisel tip. A 1/8” tip is
    useful for soldering together small countries and creating solder shorts all over
    your fine-pitched components. Conical bevel and chisel tips feature a flattened
    region that enables rapid heat transfer, and thus are easier to use than conical
    sharp tips. I have also included some soldering iron tip cleaner and some rosin
    paste flux. They are a little bit pricey, but they will make your life a lot easier,
    trust me.

    amount of soldering. The stand safely stows the hot soldering iron tip, reducing
    the chance of burns and fires.

    supply replacement project. The crimping tool is sold by Digi-Key, not Jameco.
    The crimping tool is a bit on the pricey side, but unlike sub ten dollar tools
    it features shaped crimp dies for higher-quality solderless crimps.
