- en: Drupal is an open source web-based Content Management System (CMS). Content
    management systems can be used to organize, store, and distribute various kinds
    of content, including web pages, images, audio, and documents. Modern CMS applications
    like Drupal make it relatively easy for users to add, remove, and modify content.
    This provides a viable platform for company intranet sites and even personal blogs.
    Drupal is written in PHP and stores content in a MySQL (or PostgreSQL) database.

    version control, and built-in site analytics. It also has a powerful module/plug-in
    system that allows third-party developers to extend the default feature set. If
    you need functionality that isn't included with Drupal's default feature set,
    it is probably available as a module.

- en: Early Drupal development began in 2000 when Dries Buytaert, a student at the
    University of Antwerp, built a web-based bulletin board system that he and his
    friends used to share notes. After graduation, Buytaert continued to add features,
    and in 2001, he released Drupal as an open source project. Drupal's popularity
    has increased steadily over the years; it is now deployed on many sites, such
    as those for The Onion, Forbes magazine, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
    In 2006, Drupal's developers numbered over 400, with Buytaert serving as the project
    lead.
