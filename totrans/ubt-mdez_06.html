You’ve got a web browser, an email client, a full office suite, a music player, solitaire. . . . What more could you want? Well, no matter how much is crammed into the default install, it’s always good to have options. And Ubuntu is all about options.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0001"/></p><p>Software installation works differently on Ubuntu than what you’re probably used to. On Windows, you might have to root around on a website to find an <span class="emphasis"><em>.exe</em></span> file to download or go to a store and buy a CD with the software on it. You’d then run the installer and click through a seemingly endless procession of options and questions before it decides to start installing your new application. On Mac OS, you might have to do something similar, although perhaps with a little less hassle.</p><p>Ubuntu, on the other hand, has the <span class="emphasis"><em>Software Center</em></span>, a veritable one-stop shop for all of your software needs. No need to hunt around online for a download or wait for an install CD to arrive in the mail. No need to tell some snooty installer your shoe size and favorite color either. No, the Software Center does it all for you, with a minimum of fuss. In many ways, it’s like the “app store” on a smartphone, where you can get the latest and greatest apps with little more than a click.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0004"/></p><p>The engine behind this, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Package Tool (APT)</em></span>, allows you to easily download, install, update, and remove software packaged in DEB archives, or <span class="emphasis"><em>packages</em></span>.</p><p>APT is a pretty foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go missing, since APT automatically downloads and installs any files that the main application you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called <span class="emphasis"><em>dependencies</em></span>, used to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The painful quest of finding and then installing this file or that, as well as any dependencies that those files themselves might have, has led to the missing dependency problem being referred to as “dependency hell.” APT makes that pretty much a thing of the past.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0006"/></p><p>So, where does APT find all these files and applications? Well, the packages that APT searches for, downloads, and installs are located in a set of specific repositories. These <span class="emphasis"><em>repositories</em></span> are online servers on which a great number of applications, support files, and more are stored for use with your system. All of the files that originally came bundled with your system, including the system (kernel) itself and updates, when available, are stored there too.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0007"/></p><p>The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might consider a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means you control it by typing commands in a command Terminal. That’s where the Software Center comes in—it’s a <span class="emphasis"><em>frontend</em></span> to APT. Broadly, this means that the Software Center controls APT, running all of the commands needed to install software in the background, without you needing to worry about them. Neat, huh? In this chapter, you’ll be learning all about the Software Center, as well as a couple of other frontends that you might come across from time to time.</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 6A: Installing Applications via the Ubuntu Software Center"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_6a_colon_installing_applications"/>Project 6A: Installing Applications via the Ubuntu Software Center</h1></div></div></div><p>Being the most graphically satisfying of the frontends, the Software Center is especially useful when it comes to browsing for cool or handy applications. To get a feel for it, click the Launcher icon, which looks like an orange bag with stuff exploding out the top (if you hover your mouse over it, the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Software Center</em></span> will pop up). The window that opens will look similar to <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#the_ubuntu_software_center" title="Figure 6-1. The Ubuntu Software Center">Figure 6-1</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0009"/></p><p>It may not be the first thing to catch your eye, but the number at the very bottom of the window tells you just how much stuff there is available to download from the Software Center. As this book went to press, there were 41,091 items—enough to keep anyone busy for quite some time. Thanks to Ubuntu’s open source origins, most of those items are completely free to download. That’s a lot of software to choose from, at a price you can’t argue with. There’s also an increasing amount of commercial software available (more on that later).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0010"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_ubuntu_software_center"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4772"/><img alt="The Ubuntu Software Center" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263552.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-1. The Ubuntu Software Center</p></div><p>But for now, how on earth are you supposed to wade through the gigantic mound of software that’s just been dumped on your doorstep? Fortunately, the Software Center has a few routes open to you. On the left side of the window is a list of categories. If you click any of them, you will jump to a list of all the items available for that category, possibly with more subcategories for you to explore, as in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#browsing_the_selection_of_games_availabl" title="Figure 6-2. Browsing the selection of games available from the Software Center">Figure 6-2</a>. Applications that are already installed are marked with a green checkmark over their icons, while those that are not installed display just the plain icon. Each application also has a star rating, telling you how good other users think it is. All in all, it looks and acts very much like an online store—think of it as an Amazon.com for all your Ubuntu software needs.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0012"/></p><p>To see a list of all your installed programs, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Installed</strong></span> button on the toolbar at the top of the window. A list of categories will appear; click any of them to see a list of what’s already installed. You will already have seen many of the listed applications before, in the Dash or on the Launcher. Now, take a look at the very bottom of the list of categories. There, you’ll find a small button asking if you’d like to show a rather large number of “technical items.” Click the button if you like; the screen will update, and, when you open up some of the categories, you’ll find a lot more items in the list, most of them unfamiliar. What you’re looking at are some of the hundreds of other applications and tools that are installed by default in Ubuntu, ones that you’ll likely never use yourself. You see, the Software Center isn’t just a way of getting your hands on new, exciting apps. It also keeps track of important system software that is necessary for Ubuntu to work—the “technical items” that the button refers to.</p><div class="figure"><a id="browsing_the_selection_of_games_availabl"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4799"/><img alt="Browsing the selection of games available from the Software Center" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263554.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-2. Browsing the selection of games available from the Software Center</p></div><p>For most people, there’s no need to even think about these technical items, so you can happily hide them away again by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Hide</strong></span> button at the bottom of the window. But if you’re inclined to tinker with this sort of thing, you need to be aware of a few things before you dive in. Many of these items are actually quite important for the day-to-day running of your system, and removing them might have some negative side effects. There’s a program that’s responsible for managing your Internet connection, for example; it’s probably best to leave that one alone. Also, many of the technical items are needed to make some of the more familiar applications work, like the web browser and email client. Because of the way APT handles these dependencies, removing the technical item will cause everything that depends on in to be removed too. Again, this is probably not what you want. In general, if it’s hidden away in the “technical items” list, you probably don’t want to uninstall it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0016"/></p><p>That’s quite enough on the inner workings of Ubuntu for now. It’s time for something practical. It’s time to take the Software Center out for a spin.</p><div class="sect2" title="6A-1: Selecting Applications for Installation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_selecting_applications_for_ins"/>6A-1: Selecting Applications for Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>The Ubuntu Software Center can install multiple applications simultaneously, so to give it a whirl, you can try installing a few interesting applications. Let’s start by selecting the very cool and decidedly useful diary/journal application RedNotebook (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#rednotebook_comma_the_best_journal_app_o" title="Figure 6-3. RedNotebook, the best journal app out there">Figure 6-3</a>). If you’re not already there, click the <span class="strong"><strong>All Software</strong></span> button on the toolbar to go back to the Software Center’s start screen. To select RedNotebook, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> category in the list to the left. A rather long list of available applications will appear, sorted by popularity. Hmm . . . RedNotebook doesn’t seem to be at the top of the list. Hunting through the whole list for it could get tedious, so let’s try sorting it in a different way: From the drop-down box in the top right of the window, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>By Name</strong></span> option. This will put the list into alphabetical order. Scroll down the list of available applications until you start getting to the <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>s and double-click the <span class="strong"><strong>RedNotebook</strong></span> item. A page containing information about RedNotebook will be displayed. You’ll see that it comes highly recommended by other users—four and a half stars out of five—and that it’s completely free to download. There’s also a picture of it in action on the right that you can click to zoom in on. If you scroll farther down the page, you’ll find a few more bits of information, followed by a bunch of reviews. “The best diary notebook out there at the moment,” says Scott. Sounds good to me. Assuming you too are convinced by the glowing reviews, all you need to do is click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> and type your password if prompted. This will start the installation.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0019"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="rednotebook_comma_the_best_journal_app_o"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4873"/><img alt="RedNotebook, the best journal app out there" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263556.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-3. RedNotebook, the best journal app out there</p></div><p>A progress indicator will appear on the page while RedNotebook is being downloaded and installed. Once the installation has completed, the page will reload with a green check icon next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Installed</em></span> to show that it was added to your computer successfully. If you like, you can add RedNotebook to the Launcher by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Launcher</strong></span> on the bar that has appeared at the bottom of the window. Otherwise, go to the Dash and search for RedNotebook to start the program. That’s all there is to it!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="6A-2: Searching for Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-2_colon_searching_for_applications"/>6A-2: Searching for Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>Next up is Sound Converter (I’ll talk more about using this application in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Tux Rocks">Chapter 14</a>). Scrolling through the list of programs can be tedious, so this time, try using the search feature. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>All Software</strong></span> button in the toolbar to go back to the main Software Center screen and then start typing <strong class="userinput"><code>Sound Converter</code></strong> into the search box at the top right. The search results will start to roll in immediately. Sound Converter should appear at the top of the list of results before you’ve even finished typing, so click it once to select it and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span>. The installation will start as before—but this time, try clicking <span class="strong"><strong>All Software</strong></span> while the program is still installing.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0022"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0023"/></p><p>All the installation magic will continue in the background, and you can still browse for other programs. No need to wait!</p><p>Finally, let’s add a useful utility by the name of Sysinfo (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#keeping_tabs_on_your_system_information" title="Figure 6-4. Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo">Figure 6-4</a>), a system profiler that can tell you all sorts of things about your computer. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>sysinfo</code></strong> in the search box, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Sysinfo</strong></span> search result that appears, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to add it to the installation queue. It’ll be installed as soon as the Software Center has finished dealing with Sound Converter.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0026"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="keeping_tabs_on_your_system_information"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4954"/><img alt="Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263558.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-4. Keeping tabs on your system information with Sysinfo</p></div><p>You can run the applications you’ve installed by going to the Dash and searching for them, as usual. Alternatively, open up the Dash and click the icon for the Applications lens at the bottom of the screen (the one that looks like a ruler and some pencils, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#the_icon_for_the_applications_lens" title="Figure 6-5. The icon for the Applications lens">Figure 6-5</a>). Then, click <span class="strong"><strong>Filter results</strong></span> and select the category that your chosen application was in from the list on the right. That would be Office for RedNotebook, Media for Sound Converter, and Accessories for Sysinfo. You’ll find the application you’re looking for in the main part of the window.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_icon_for_the_applications_lens"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e4969"/><img alt="The icon for the Applications lens" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263560.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-5. The icon for the Applications lens</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="6A-3: Uninstalling Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-3_colon_uninstalling_applications"/>6A-3: Uninstalling Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>As you can see, installing applications via the Ubuntu Software Center is quite simple. And fortunately, it’s just as easy to uninstall them. Navigate to (or search for) the program you want to remove, click it once in the list, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button that appears. Enter your password again if asked and watch as the program is uninstalled. If you want to uninstall a few programs in one go, you might find it faster to click the <span class="strong"><strong>Installed</strong></span> button on the toolbar and browse through the list of installed applications. For each one that you want to uninstall, select it with a click, and you’ll see the Remove button appear again.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0029"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-4_colon_commercial_vs._free_software"/>6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software</h2></div></div></div><p>A relatively recent addition to Ubuntu is the availability of commercial software. Back in the early days, Linux distributions like Ubuntu would include only free software—free as in “no charge for it” but also free as in “freedom.” That was the open source way—lots of people sharing the programs that they wrote, usually just for the fun of it, without any hint of a desire to charge for them. For the most part, this is still how it works: The vast majority of the software developers writing programs for Linux have continued to share their apps openly. But more recently, a few distros have started to let in commercial software developers, people who charge for their products. Ubuntu is one of them. The idea is that most people are used to paying for software and aren’t so bothered about the open source aspect that they don’t like having more apps to choose from. The free apps will always be there, and they’ll always be in the majority. But all the same, you can now buy software for Ubuntu.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0031"/></p><p>To see what commercial software is available, click the arrow immediately to the right of the All Software button on the toolbar and select <span class="strong"><strong>For Purchase</strong></span> from the menu that pops up (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#finding_commercial_software_in_the_softw" title="Figure 6-6. Finding commercial software in the Software Center">Figure 6-6</a>). A pretty lengthy list will appear—there are lots of games, a number of ebooks and magazines, and the odd system utility here and there. The list is growing all the time as more and more software developers sign up to distribute their apps through the Software Center. To see what’s been added recently, click <span class="strong"><strong>All Software</strong></span> to go back to the main Software Center view and check out the What’s New pane in the middle of the window. There’s a More button at the top right of the pane that you can click to see a more complete list. You’ll find that not all of the software listed is commercial, but a lot of it seems to be.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0032"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It might seem a little strange that books and magazines are available through the Software Center, but that’s just the way it’s been set up. Many of the books that are available are about Linux and computers in general, so the Software Center isn’t such a strange place to display them.</p></div><p>Installing commercial software isn’t too different from installing the free stuff. The only difference is the payment step, which is quite similar to what you’re used to if you shop online. If you find a commercial app that you like in the list, double-click it to go to its information page. The price will be displayed at the top left of the page in US dollars. Now, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Buy</strong></span> button to the right. You’ll be taken to a page asking you to enter your <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu single sign-on account</em></span> details. If you don’t have an account already, click the <span class="strong"><strong>New Account</strong></span> button farther down the page and follow the instructions it gives you. Once you have an account, log in and follow the instructions to give your payment details. Once everything has gone through, the download will start, and you’ll be the proud owner of a brand new app.</p><div class="figure"><a id="finding_commercial_software_in_the_softw"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e5048"/><img alt="Finding commercial software in the Software Center" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263562.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-6. Finding commercial software in the Software Center</p></div><p>When you buy a commercial application through the Software Center, the purchase is recorded and kept with the details of your Ubuntu single sign-on account. If you ever need to reinstall Ubuntu, or accidentally uninstall an app that you bought, this means that all is not lost—you can easily reinstall any of your purchased applications. With the Software Center open, move your mouse to the very top of the screen to display the menu bar and click <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Reinstall Previous Purchases</strong></span>. If prompted for your single sign-on account details, enter them in the window provided and follow the instructions onscreen.

Updates are made available quite regularly and consist of newer versions of packages you already have installed. Most of the time, a newer version will have been released because it fixes some security issue, but updates may also fix problems with software and introduce new features.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0037"/></p><p>The Update Manager will pop up of its own accord when updates are available, so it’s probably best just to forget about it until it decides to appear. But just this once, let’s be a little more proactive. First of all, make sure that the Software Center isn’t currently installing or removing anything; although it doesn’t become an issue very often, be aware that you can’t use two APT frontends at the same time. Now, open the Dash and search for Update Manager. Once the Update Manager window appears (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#upgrading_packages_en_masse_via_update_m" title="Figure 6-7. Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager">Figure 6-7</a>), click the <span class="strong"><strong>Check</strong></span> button to make sure the package information is as up-to-date as possible. Strictly, you don’t <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to do this—it automatically checks for updates every day all by itself. But hey, you never know. A small window will pop up detailing its progress, and after a short while, a list of all the available updates will appear in the Update Manager window.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0038"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="upgrading_packages_en_masse_via_update_m"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e5108"/><img alt="Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263564.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 6-7. Upgrading packages en masse via Update Manager</p></div><p>If you’ve only recently installed Ubuntu, there might be quite a few updates in the list. You’ll see just how many, and how long they will all take to download, just below the list. If there are any applications you don’t want to upgrade, you can go through the list and uncheck the box next to their names. But for now, it’s safest just to leave all the boxes checked. Either way, once you’re ready, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install Updates</strong></span> button. The selected updates will then be downloaded and installed. Once the installation is complete, the Update Manager window will refresh itself, leaving you with a (hopefully) empty list. And there you have it—a thoroughly up-to-date system. Depending on what you installed, another notification may appear telling you that you will have to restart your system in order for the changes to take effect. If so, it’s best to be obedient and reboot (but not before saving all of your work, of course).</p><div class="sect2" title="How Often Should You Install Updates?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_often_should_you_install_updates_que"/>How Often Should You Install Updates?</h2></div></div></div><p>As I already mentioned, Ubuntu will check for updates every day, and the Update Manager window will appear on your desktop if it finds any. If this is happening too often and you find yourself feeling pestered, open the Ubuntu Software Center and click <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Software</strong></span> Sources.

Weekly updates should be fine if you’re finding daily updates a bit too stressful. You’ll find a couple of other interesting options there too. Under the When there are security updates option, if you select Download and install automatically, updates will happen silently, without any intervention from you.

This happens quite rarely nowadays, but it’s still a possibility no matter what operating system you are using. It can happen in Windows, it can happen in Mac OS, and it can happen in Linux. Therefore, it is always a good idea to wait a bit before installing a seemingly major update and to check the user forums first for any disaster stories about a particular update.

All is not lost. In fact, nothing is lost . . . most likely. Just start up your machine again. If you have a dual-boot system, you will arrive at the GRUB boot menu, just like always. If you’re not a dual-booter, you’ll have to get to this menu by holding down <span class="keycap">shift</span> as soon as you start the computer. Don’t let go of the shift key until the GRUB menu appears (or Ubuntu starts, in which case you missed your cue, and you’ll have to restart the computer and try again). In the GRUB menu, you will see that you seem to have more than one Ubuntu system installed on your hard disk, which is true to some extent. For a short-term fix, you can take advantage of this by traveling back in time to the core system (the Linux kernel) that you had in place before your ill-fated upgrade. Just use your arrow keys to select a kernel that ends in a number lower than the highest (3.2.0-22 rather than 3.2.0-24, for example), press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, and voilá! You are back to the system you have come to know and love. You’ll have to do this each time you start up your machine, but at least you will have the chance to back up your valuable files before doing some research on the problem and trying again later.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0048"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0049"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0050"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0051"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0053"/></p><p>With all this disaster and recovery talk, I hope I haven’t scared you away from the idea of updating your system.

But as it turns out, a whole world of software is waiting for you outside the official Ubuntu repositories, and it’s not much more difficult to reach. Various individuals and companies compile small numbers of packages that are not available in Ubuntu into their own <span class="emphasis"><em>third-party repositories</em></span>. These are typically free to access, if you can find them. All you need to do is tell APT to search for packages in one of these repositories as well as Ubuntu’s, and you’ll be able to get at the extra software.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0056"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0057"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0058"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0059"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0060"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0061"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0062"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0064"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0065"/></p><p>Each repository has its own <span class="emphasis"><em>APT line</em></span>. This is similar to a web address but contains extra information about the repository, which APT uses to figure out what sort of packages it contains. You’ll need to get the correct APT line from the website of the repository you’re trying to add, so let’s pick an example to see how it works. Open Firefox and head over to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install">http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install</a>. GetDeb specializes in making packages for software that hasn’t officially made it into Ubuntu yet. There should be some instructions on installing packages from GetDeb in a box at the top of the page, so skip to the second item in the list and find the APT line, which should look something like this: <code class="literal">deb</code> <a class="ulink" href="http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu">http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu</a> <code class="literal">precise-getdeb apps</code>. This follows the same format as all APT lines: the word <code class="literal">deb</code>, followed by a web address, followed by a couple of other words that specify which part of the repository should be checked by APT when it’s looking for programs. Highlight the APT line, right-click it, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0066"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0067"/></p><p>While you’re in Firefox, you’ll also need to grab the repository’s <span class="emphasis"><em>GPG key</em></span> (which I’ll explain more at the end of this section). It should be linked to from the same website you got the APT line from; in the case of GetDeb, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key">http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key</a>; when the Opening getdeb-archive.key window appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Save File</strong></span> and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save the key file.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0068"/></p><p>Now that you’re in possession of these vital bits of information, adding the repository to your system is pretty straightforward:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In the Software Center, click <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Software Sources</strong></span> and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Other Software</strong></span> tab in the Software Sources window that appears.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>.

It was related to a security measure that checks whether the packages are from where you think they’re from. (In theory, it’s possible that someone could hijack a repository and put harmful fake packages in there.) If you don’t add the GPG key, the Software Center will refuse to display any of the packages from the repository since it won’t trust it. Having the GPG key isn’t enough to keep you completely safe from nasty surprises, though. You should always exercise caution when using a third-party (that is, non-Ubuntu) repository; make sure it’s trustworthy before you add it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0073"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0074"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0075"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0076"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0077"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0078"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0079"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0080"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0081"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0082"/></p><div class="sect2" title="APT-URL: Installing from Websites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="apt-url_colon_installing_from_websites"/>APT-URL: Installing from Websites</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you’ve added GetDeb to the list of available software repositories, you can take advantage of yet another APT frontend. Go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getdeb.net/">http://www.getdeb.net/</a> and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Apps</strong></span> tab. Peruse the list of programs until you find something agreeable—I chose a time management application called <span class="emphasis"><em>hamster-applet</em></span>—and click <span class="strong"><strong>Install this now</strong></span>, just below its picture.

When it’s all over, close the Software Center and go find your new application in the Dash. Quick and easy.</p><p>Plenty of websites support APT links, but you won’t be able to download software from them unless you’ve added their repository to your computer, as you did with GetDeb.

There are all sorts of little programs out there that someone has written to scratch an itch of theirs, and plenty of them are available to you, for free, if you know where to get them. Luckily, most of them can now be found in <span class="emphasis"><em>personal package archives (PPAs)</em></span> on Ubuntu’s project website, Launchpad. PPAs are miniature software repositories that are an easy way for people to share their home-brewed software with others (emphasis on the home-brewed—sometimes software from PPAs doesn’t work very well). Increasingly, PPAs are also being used by the developers of important software like Firefox to get their latest and greatest out to users. Whether it’s official updates or homebrew apps that you’re looking for, you can find software in PPAs by visiting <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/</a> and searching for what you want.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0083"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0084"/></p><p>In this example, you’ll see how to install Turtle Arena, a ninja battle game that involves a strangely familiar cast of turtles(see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#playing_turtle_arena" title="Figure 6-12. Playing Turtle Arena">Figure 6-12</a>):<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0085"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-6-0086"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>games</code></strong> into the search box at <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/</a> and click <span class="strong"><strong>Search</strong></span> to get underway.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Look through the results to find Turtle Arena, and then click that link.
