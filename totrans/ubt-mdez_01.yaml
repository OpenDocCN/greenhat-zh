- en: As the saying goes, there’s no place to begin like the beginning, so in this
    chapter we’ll do just that by introducing you to the world of Linux. We’ll then
    get you up to snuff on what this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want
    to install and use it, and what you will need in order to do so. For those of
    you who already have joined the Linux world and have Ubuntu or another distribution
    installed on your machines, some of this may be old news, but a few bits of information
    may still be of interest to you. For those others who may be curious but are still
    unsure whether or not to take the plunge, or those of you who have no idea what
    Linux even is and have picked up this book to find out, this chapter will prove
    especially useful.

    and, like most people, you may also have a few doubts or worries. Hopefully by
    the time you finish, you will have your Linux system up and running; any doubts
    or worries you might have had will have been dispelled; and your questions, for
    the most part, will be answered. If you are reluctant to make a commitment by
    installing Ubuntu on your hard disk, remember that you can still follow along
    because the disc that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu
    installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu
    Linux experience without having to even touch your hard drive.

    really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own,
    it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it
    to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The
    OS takes a well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and educates
    it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do.

    operating systems in terms of both its capabilities and its heritage. *Linux*
    was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wannabe out to make money.
    The Linux core, referred to as the *kernel*, was created by computer enthusiast
    Linus Torvalds, a member of Finland’s Swedish ethnic minority, who wanted to create
    a Unix-like system that would work on home computers—particularly his.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world,
    so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it better and more
    powerful. It is this combination of applications built around the core of the
    Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions today.

    devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, reliable,
    free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, on
    its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no
    windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are
    behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen,
    command line-driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as DOS on
    steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing
    commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is
    used as a server), you don’t have to do that. It is fair to say that with the
    advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,
    pronounced “goo-ee”), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They
    began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which
    gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go graphical.
    The community at large developed various GUIs (called window managers and desktop
    environments) and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly
    referred to as the *Window System*). The graphical desktop environment that is
    included in your Ubuntu distribution—Unity—is one example of the fruit of that
    development.

    as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux
    mascot, and what has come to be thought of as *the* Linux penguin was designed
    by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see [Figure 1-1](ch01.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot
    "Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot")). This explains not only the ornithological
    references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin
    icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include *penguin* or *Tux*
    in their names, such as TuxRacer, Tux Paint, and Pingus. This, combined with the
    fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes
    referred to as Penguinistas. True, Ubuntu doesn’t play up the penguin as much
    as other distributions, but Linux is Linux so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too
    . . . just a bit less conspicuously.

    want usually comes bundled in a Linux distribution, and there are still thousands
    of additional applications that you can add for free. And unlike the freeware
    and shareware applications in the Windows and Mac worlds, which eventually ask
    you for $25 here and $35 there, you will not be hit up for money when you least
    expect it. You will also not have to worry about the applications installing,
    unbeknownst to you, *backdoors* or *keyloggers* or making your system a sudden
    garden of adware.

    reason Linux users make the switch. For some, it is a matter of personal philosophy—the
    belief that software should be freely accessible to all. Others like it because
    it gives them total control over almost everything, from how things behave to
    how they look; in other words, Linux lets them geek around. Others like it because
    of the stability Linux is noted for. Try running your current system for a month
    without restarting and see what happens. Linux has been known to run without a
    reboot for more than a year without a hitch or decrease in performance. With its
    multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a perfect choice for language students
    or users in a multilingual environment.

    functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and distribute
    the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in
    working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen
    to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user groups, and even private
    individuals. These entities create Linux system and application collections called
    *distributions*, or *distros*. You could bypass such distros and try to collect
    everything you’d need to set up a system all on your own, but you would undoubtedly
    lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt for the distros.
  prefs: []

    graphical interface support; one or more graphical desktop environments; and a

    is the software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other convenience
    features such as the package (or application) installation mechanism and the installer
    for the system itself. Some distros are especially appropriate for home users
    because of their ease of installation. Ubuntu, a relative newcomer to the Linux
    world, is one of these, joining other distros that have long been popular in the

    Well, as they say, numbers don’t lie, and Ubuntu’s popularity is not without good
    cause. Like most Linux distributions these days, Ubuntu is easy to install and
    quite robust and dependable in terms of everyday use. Unlike other distributions,
    however, Ubuntu is based on the *Debian* distribution, which means that it utilizes
    Debian’s very convenient DEB package system for application handling and installation.
    The graphical package installer that comes with Ubuntu, Ubuntu Software Center,
    makes installing those applications even easier, and with so many applications
    available there, you are likely to find more software than you’ll ever know what
    to do with.

    it is designed primarily as a desktop system, and perhaps for that reason, Ubuntu’s
    desktop environment, called Unity, is a very comfy place for the average desktop
    user.

    six-month release cycle. In this time frame, it tries to stay as up-to-date as
    possible, while at the same time making sure that things are not released before
    they are ready for prime time. In this way, you are ensured of having an up-to-date

    installing a Linux distribution, but these days it’s less of an issue for a number
    of reasons. Of course, there are so many minor parts to your machine that it is
    difficult to say whether each part will cooperate with your installation. There
    are video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, and so on, and they all need
    to be considered. Nevertheless, chances are good that Ubuntu will run on your
    machine. The even better news is you can test whether your setup will work by

    see whether you can identify what part of your hardware puzzle is causing your

    you can search for hardware that is supported by Linux.) Of course, before you
    can do this, you need to know what models of hardware you have. You should know
    at least what motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, and video card
    you have if you want to be able to find out anything of value. Identifying your

    Manager** button and see what you can find out about your system components. Sometimes
    the information there is limited, so you might instead want to try a shareware
    application such as HWiNFO ([http://www.hwinfo.com/](http://www.hwinfo.com/))

    recommend doing this if you have a laptop. Once inside, you needn’t worry about
    damaging anything because you don’t need to touch anything—so don’t. You may need
    a flashlight to find it, but the model name and number should be stamped on there
    somewhere, either in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example,
    says quite clearly in the middle of the board “AOpen MX46-533V.” You should be
    looking for similar information.
