Most of the critical protocols of the suite function at the lower layers of the OSI Reference Model (covered in <a class="xref" href="pt02.html" title="Part I-2. THE OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION (OSI) REFERENCE MODEL">Part I-2</a>): layers 2, 3 and 4, which correspond to the network interface, Internet, and transport layers in the TCP/IP model architecture (described in <a class="xref" href="pt03.html" title="Part I-3. TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE AND ARCHITECTURE">Part I-3</a>). Included here are the all-important Internet Protocol (IP) at layer 3 and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) at layer 4, which combine to give TCP/IP its name.</p><p>Due to the importance of these and other TCP/IP protocols at the lower layers, this is the largest of the three sections of this book. It contains eight parts. The first describes the two TCP/IP protocols that reside at the network interface layer (layer 2 of the OSI Reference Model): the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and the Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP). The second part describes a couple of special protocols that reside architecturally between layers 2 and 3: the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). The third and fourth parts describe the IP versions 4 and 6 (IPv4 and IPv6). The fifth and sixth parts discuss IP-related feature and support protocols, and the seventh part describes IP routing protocols. Finally, the eighth part covers the two TCP/IP transport layer protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and related topics such as the use of TCP/IP ports.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. TCP/IP SERIAL LINE INTERNET PROTOCOL (SLIP) AND POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL (PPP) OVERVIEW AND FUNDAMENTALS">Chapter 9</a></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PPP CORE PROTOCOLS: LINK CONTROL, NETWORK CONTROL, AND AUTHENTICATION">Chapter 10</a></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PPP PROTOCOL FRAME FORMATS">Chapter 12</a></p><p>The lowest layer of the OSI Reference Model is the physical layer, which is responsible for the nitty-gritty details of transmitting information from one place to another on a network. The layer just above the physical layer is the <span class="emphasis"><em>data link layer</em></span>, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>network interface layer</em></span>, or just the <span class="emphasis"><em>link layer</em></span>, in the TCP/IP architectural model. Its primary jobs are to implement networks at the local level and to interface between the hardware-oriented physical layer and the more abstract, software-oriented functions of the network layer and the layers above it.</p><p>In the case of TCP/IP, the Internet Protocol (IP) is the main protocol at layer 3, and it serves as the foundation of the whole TCP/IP protocol suite. IP is designed to be layered on top of any number of layer 2 technologies. However, some types of connections do not include a layer 2 protocol over which IP can run. To enable TCP/IP to operate on these kinds of links, two special TCP/IP protocols operate at the network interface layer, connecting IP to the physical layer below.</p><p>In this part, I provide a description of the two protocols that reside at the data link, or network interface layer, in the TCP/IP protocol suite. These are the older, simple Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP) and the newer, more capable Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). I begin with a chapter that provides a brief overview of SLIP and PPP, showing how they fit into the TCP/IP protocol suite as a whole and describing them in general terms.</p><p>The rest of this part contains three chapters that describe the more important of the two protocols, PPP, in more detail. The first of these three explains the core protocols that are responsible for setting up PPP links and basic operation. The second covers the protocols used to implement various special features in PPP, such as compression and encryption. The last chapter on PPP provides detailed information about the various frame formats used by PPP protocols.</p></div></div>

That model also defines the network interface layer, which corresponds to the data link layer. However, in most network implementations, TCP/IP doesn't define any protocols operating at this layer. Instead, TCP/IP assumes that layer 2 functionality is provided by a wide area network (WAN) or local area network (LAN) technology like Ethernet, Token Ring, or IEEE 802.11. These technologies are responsible for the classic layer 2 functions: physical layer addressing, media access control, and especially, layer 2 framing of datagrams received from layer 3.</p><p>There's a problem with the assumption that Internet Protocol (IP) can run on top of an existing layer 2 protocol because sometimes there isn't one. Certain technologies, such as a simple serial connection between two devices, establish only a basic, low-level connection at the physical layer. And, of course, one type of serial connection is still <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> popular: serial dial-up networking. When you connect with a dial-up modem to your ISP, the modems negotiate a connection that architecturally exists only at the physical layer.</p><p>Since IP assumes certain services will be provided at layer 2, there is no way to make it operate directly over a serial line or other physical layer connection. At a minimum, the most important layer 2 function that is required is some mechanism for framing the IP datagram for transmission; that is, a mechanism that provides the necessary data packaging to let datagrams be transmitted over the physical layer network. Without this, IP datagrams cannot be sent over the link.</p><div class="sect1" title="SLIP versus PPP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="slip_versus_ppp"/>SLIP versus PPP</h1></div></div></div><p>To fill the gap between IP at layer 3 and the physical connection at layer 1, two protocols operate at layer 2 and provide the services that IP requires to function. One protocol is <span class="emphasis"><em>Serial Line Internet Protocol</em></span> (SLIP), a very simple layer 2 protocol that provides only basic framing for IP. The other is <span class="emphasis"><em>Point-to-Point Protocol</em></span> (PPP), a more complex, full-featured data link layer protocol that provides framing as well as many additional features that improve security and performance.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0432"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0433"/></p><p>SLIP is extremely simple and easy to implement but lacks certain features of PPP (like authentication, compression, and error detection), which is full featured but more complicated. To draw an analogy, SLIP is a mostly sturdy, ten-year-old compact sedan, while PPP is a shiny, new luxury SUV. Both will get you from here to grandma's house, but the SUV is going to be safer, more comfortable, and better able to deal with problems that might crop up on the road. If they cost the same to buy and operate, you'd probably choose the SUV. Both SLIP and PPP cost about the same, and unlike an SUV, PPP causes no air pollution and doesn't guzzle gas. For this reason, PPP is the choice of most serial line connections today and has all but replaced SLIP.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-58"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>SLIP</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>PPP</em></span> provide layer 2 connectivity for TCP/IP implementations that run directly over a physical layer link without a layer 2 technology.

Since there are only two devices, A and B, communication is straightforward: A sends to B and B sends to A, and since both deal only with simple two-device connections, they do not have to manage complexities like media access control, collisions, and unique addressing schemes in the way that technologies like Ethernet must.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-38"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Some people don't consider SLIP and PPP to be part of the true TCP/IP protocol suite.

<div class="sect1" title="Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="serial_line_internet_protocol_slip"/>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)</h1></div></div></div><p>The need for a data link layer protocol to allow IP to operate over serial links was identified very early on in the development of TCP/IP. Engineers working on IP needed a way to send IP datagrams over serial links. To solve the problem, they created the very simple protocol <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0434"/>SLIP to frame IP messages for transmission across the serial line.</p><p>Unlike most TCP/IP protocols, SLIP has never been defined as a formalized standard. It was created informally in the early 1980s, and it became the de facto standard before it was ever described in a Request for Comment (RFC). When it was published in 1988 (RFC 1055, "A Nonstandard for Transmission of IP Datagrams over Serial Lines: SLIP"), the decision was made to designate it a "nonstandard protocol."</p><p>SLIP was designated nonstandard because it was developed as a very rudimentary, stopgap measure to provide layer 2 <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0435"/>framing when needed. SLIP is so simple that there really isn't much to standardize. Too, it has so many deficiencies that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) apparently didn't want to formalize it as a standard. RFC 1055 specifically mentions various problems with SLIP (as I'll discuss later in this chapter) and the fact that work was already under way to define PPP as a more capable successor to SLIP.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-59"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> SLIP provides a <span class="emphasis"><em>layer 2 framing service</em></span> for IP datagrams but no other features or capabilities.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="SLIP Data Framing Method and General Operation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="slip_data_framing_method_and_general_ope"/>SLIP Data Framing Method and General Operation</h2></div></div></div><p>SLIP performs only one function: the framing of data for transmission. Here's how SLIP framing works. An IP datagram is passed down to SLIP, which breaks it into bytes and sends those bytes one at a time over the link. After the last byte of the datagram is sent, a special byte value is sent that tells the receiving device that the datagram has ended. This is called the SLIP <span class="emphasis"><em>END character</em></span>, and it has a byte value of 192 in decimal numbers (C0 in hexadecimal and 11000000 binary). That's basically SLIP framing in a nutshell: Take the whole datagram, send it one byte at a time, and then send the byte 192 to delimit the end of the datagram.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0436"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0437"/></p><p>One minor enhancement to SLIP's basic operation is to <span class="emphasis"><em>precede</em></span> the datagram with an <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> character as well, thus clearly separating the start of the datagram from anything that precedes it. To see why this might be needed, you can imagine that at a particular time you have only one datagram to send: datagram 1. You send 1, and then send the <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> character to delimit it. Now, suppose there is a pause before the next datagram shows up. During that time, you aren't transmitting, but if there is line noise, the other device might pick up spurious bytes here and there. If you later receive datagram 2 and just start sending it, the receiving device might think the noise bytes were part of datagram 2.</p><p>Starting datagram 2 off with an <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> character tells the recipient that anything received between this <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> character and the previous one is a separate datagram. If that's just noise, then this "noise datagram" is just gibberish that will be rejected at the IP layer. Meanwhile, it doesn't corrupt the real datagram you wish to send. If no noise occurred on the line between datagrams, then the recipient will just see the <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> at the start of datagram 2 right after the one at the end of datagram 1 and will ignore the "null datagram" between the two.</p><p>But what if the <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> character is 192 in decimal numbers; what happens if the byte value 192 appears in the datagram itself? Transmitting it as is would fool the recipient into thinking that the datagram ended prematurely. To avoid this, an <span class="emphasis"><em>Escape character</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>ESC</em></span>) is defined, which has a decimal value of 219 (DB in hex, 11011011 in binary). This symbol means that "this byte and the next are special." When a value of 192 appears in the datagram, the sending device replaces it with the ESC character followed by the value 220 decimal. Thus, a single 192 becomes 219 220 (or DB DC in hexadecimal). The recipient translates back from 219 220 to 192.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-39"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The SLIP</em></span> ESC <span class="emphasis"><em>character is not the same as the ASCII</em></span> ESC <span class="emphasis"><em>character.

IP datagrams are passed down to the SLIP software at layer 2 (a simplified one with only five bytes is shown here). There, they are framed by surrounding them with <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> characters (hexadecimal value C0h, shown with diagonal hatching). Special characters with hexadecimal values DBh and C0h are replaced by two-byte sequences. Note that the presence of the bracketing <span class="emphasis"><em>END</em></span> characters forces the receiving device to see the noise byte (03h, in black) as a separate IP datagram, rather than part of either of the real ones.

SLIP simply doesn't provide many of the features and capabilities you really need on modern serial links. SLIP is most deficient in the following areas:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0439"/></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Standardized Datagram Size Specification</strong></span> SLIP's maximum supported datagram size is not standardized and depends on each implementation. The usual default is 1,006 bytes, which becomes the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the link (see <a class="xref" href="ch27.html" title="Chapter 27. IPV6 DATAGRAM SIZE, FRAGMENTATION, REASSEMBLY, AND ROUTING">Chapter 27</a>). If a different size is used, you must program this into the IP layer.</p><div class="figure"><a id="operation_of_the_serial_line_internet_pr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9816"/><img alt="Operation of the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) SLIP's only function is to frame data from layer 3 (usually IP datagrams) by surrounding them with END characters and replacing special characters as needed." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages287725.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-1. Operation of the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) SLIP's only function is to frame data from layer 3 (usually IP datagrams) by surrounding them with END characters and replacing special characters as needed.</p></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Error Detection and Correction Mechanism</strong></span> SLIP doesn't provide any way of detecting or correcting errors in transmissions. While such protection is provided at higher layers through IP header checksums and other mechanisms, it is a job traditionally also done at layer 2. The reason is that relying on those higher layers means that errors are detected only after an entire datagram has been sent and passed back up the stack at the recipient. Error correction can come only in the form of resending any datagrams that were corrupted. This is inefficient, especially because serial links are generally much slower than normal LAN links.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Control Messaging</strong></span> SLIP offers no way for the two devices to communicate control information that may be required to manage the link.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Type Identification</strong></span> Since SLIP includes no headers of its own, it is not possible to identify that SLIP is being used. While developed for IP, there is no reason why other layer 3 protocols could not be sent using SLIP (if you were running more than one internetworking protocol at the higher layers). However, without type identification, there is no way to mix datagrams from two or more layer 3 protocols on the same link.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Address Discovery Method</strong></span> Addressing isn't needed at layer 2 because there are only two devices in a point-to-point connection, so each device is obviously only sending to the other one. However, devices do need some way of learning each other's IP addresses for routing at layer 3. SLIP provides no method for this.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Support for Compression</strong></span> Compression would improve performance over serial lines that are otherwise slow compared to other technologies. SLIP provides no compression features. (Note, however, that modems usually do support compression at layer 1 for serial connections that use them.) A variant on SLIP called <span class="emphasis"><em>Compressed SLIP</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>CSLIP</em></span> was created in the late 1980s, but it was not as widely deployed as regular SLIP.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0440"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0441"/></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Security Features</strong></span> SLIP lacks even basic security features, with no means for authenticating connections or encrypting data.</p><p>SLIP's many shortcomings have led most implementations to move from SLIP to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0442"/>PPP, which is a much richer data link protocol for direct connections that resolves SLIP's problems. SLIP is now outdated. Still, SLIP continues to be used in many places. Simplicity is attractive, and people are famous for their inertia: If something is implemented and is working well, many will refuse to change unless they are forced to do so.</p></div></div>

Each encompasses a general class of PPP functionality and is represented by either one protocol in the suite or a set of protocols. The PPP standard describes three main components of PPP:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPP Encapsulation Method</strong></span> The primary job of PPP is to take higher-layer messages, such as IP datagrams, and encapsulate them for transmission over the underlying physical layer link. To this end, PPP defines a special frame format for encapsulating data for transmission, based on the framing used in HDLC. The PPP frame was designed to be small and contain only simple fields in order to maximize bandwidth efficiency and speed in processing.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Control Protocol (LCP)</strong></span> LCP is responsible for setting up, maintaining, and terminating the link between devices. It is a flexible, extensible protocol that allows many configuration parameters to be exchanged to ensure that both devices agree on how the link will be used.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Network Control Protocols (NCPs)</strong></span> PPP supports the encapsulation of many different layer 3 datagram types. Some of these require additional setup before the link can be activated. Once the general link setup is completed with LCP, control is passed to the NCP that is specific to the layer 3 protocol being carried on the PPP link. For example, when IP is carried over PPP, the NCP used is the PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP). Other NCPs are defined for supporting the Internetworking Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol, the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) protocol, and so forth.</p><p>The PPP encapsulation method and LCP are defined in the main PPP standard and some support standards; the NCPs are described in separate standard documents, one per NCP.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="PPP Functional Groups"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ppp_functional_groups"/>PPP Functional Groups</h2></div></div></div><p>While PPP's main components constitute much of the total package, I would add two additional functional groups.

Examples include the authentication protocols Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), which are used by LCP during the optional Authentication phase.

For example, the PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) allows compression of PPP data; the PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) enables datagrams to be encrypted for security; and the PPP Multilink Protocol (PPP MP) allows a single PPP link to be operated over multiple physical links. These protocols often also require additional setup during link negotiation, so many of them define extensions (such as extra configuration options) that are negotiated as part of LCP.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-42"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Each optional protocol is defined by a specific standards document, as you will see later in this chapter</em></span>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="General Operation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="general_operation"/>General Operation</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the PPP suite includes dozens of protocols, its general operation is really quite straightforward.

During link setup, the devices agree on all the parameters needed to manage the operation of the link. LCP begins this process and invokes the help of support protocols as needed, for options like authentication. Once the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0458"/>link is set up, in order to complete link setup, the appropriate NCP is called for whatever layer 3 technology is being carried on the link.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0459"/>Operation</strong></span> The devices use the link to send datagrams. Each device transmits by encapsulating layer 3 datagrams and sending them down to layer 1 to be transmitted.

Only when this is completed can frames actually pass over the link.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-9-0460"/></p><p>LCP is generally in charge of setting up and maintaining PPP links. LCP may invoke an authentication protocol (PAP or CHAP) when PPP is configured to use authentication. Once an LCP link has been opened, PPP invokes one or more NCPs for the layer 3 protocol being carried on the link. These perform any network-layer-specific configuration needed before the link can carry that particular network layer protocol.</p><p>The operation of a PPP link can be described as having a life of sorts: A PPP link is established, configured, used, and eventually terminated. The process of setting up, using, and closing a PPP link is described in the PPP standard as a series of <span class="emphasis"><em>phases</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>states</em></span>. This is a type of <span class="emphasis"><em>finite state machine (FSM)</em></span>, which is a tool used to explain the operation of protocols.

For the sake of clarity, this description is based on an example for which Device A is a PC connecting via dial-up networking to Remote Host B (see <a class="xref" href="ch09s03.html#ppp_phases_a_ppp_connection_follows_a_ma" title="Figure 9-4. PPP phases A PPP connection follows a mainly linear sequence of transitions from the Link Dead Phase through the Link Open Phase.">Figure 9-4</a>).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-43"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When we talk about a PPP link overall, we are talking about the status of the LCP connection between the two devices.

If Device B doesn't agree, it returns a negative acknowledgment or rejection, telling Device A what it won't accept. Device A can then try a different configuration request with new parameters that Device B may accept. (This process is described in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PPP CORE PROTOCOLS: LINK CONTROL, NETWORK CONTROL, AND AUTHENTICATION">Chapter 10</a>.)</p><p>If Device A and Device B eventually come to agreement, the link status is considered <span class="emphasis"><em>LCP open</em></span> and will proceed to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Authentication</em></span> phase.

These may include a user request (you click Disconnect when you want to log off your dial-up session); link quality problems (the modem hangs up on you due to line noise); or some other cause (you spend too much time in the bathroom and your ISP's idle timer logs you out).

Closing an NCP link does not cause the LCP link to be closed. Even if all NCPs are closed, the LCP link remains open. (Of course, no data can be passed until an appropriate NCP link is reestablished; a device is required to discard frames received that contain any layer 3 protocol that does not have an open NCP.)

<div class="sect1" title="The Network Control Protocols (IPCP, IPXCP, NBFCP, and Others)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_network_control_protocols_ipcp_ipxcp"/>The Network Control Protocols (IPCP, IPXCP, NBFCP, and Others)</h1></div></div></div><p>Although PPP was originally created to carry IP datagrams, its designers realized that it could easily carry data from many types of network layer protocols, and that, on some networks, it might even be advantageous to let it carry datagrams from different layer 3 protocols simultaneously.</p><p>Allowing <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0482"/>PPP to support multiple network layer protocols would require it to have knowledge of each one's idiosyncrasies. If you used only LCP for link configuration, the device would need to know all the unique requirements of each layer 3 protocol. This would also require you to update LCP constantly as new layer 3 protocols were defined and as new parameters were defined for existing ones.</p><p>To eliminate this potential issue, PPP takes a modular approach to link establishment. LCP performs the basic link setup, and after (optional) authentication, invokes an <span class="emphasis"><em>NCP</em></span> that is specific to each layer 3 protocol that is to be carried over the link. The NCP negotiates any parameters that are unique to the particular network layer protocol, and more than one NCP can be run for each LCP link (see the discussion of PPP link setup and phases in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. TCP/IP SERIAL LINE INTERNET PROTOCOL (SLIP) AND POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL (PPP) OVERVIEW AND FUNDAMENTALS">Chapter 9</a>).</p><p>Each of the common network layer technologies has a PPP NCP defined for it in a separate RFC. The most common ones, "The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)," "The PPP Internetworking Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP)," and "The PPP NetBIOS Frames Control Protocol (NBFCP)," are NCPs for IP, IPX, and NBF (also called NetBEUI), respectively. A separate NCP is also defined for IP version 6, the "PPP IP Version 6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP)."</p><div class="sect2" title="Operation of NCPs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="operation_of_ncps"/>Operation of NCPs</h2></div></div></div><p>Each NCP operates very much like a light version of LCP, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#ppp_ip_control_protocol_ipcp_message_exc" title="Figure 10-3. PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) message exchanges The message exchanges, performed to configure and terminate IPCP, are quite similar to those used for LCP.">Figure 10-3</a>. (To see the similarities, you should compare <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#ppp_ip_control_protocol_ipcp_message_exc" title="Figure 10-3. PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) message exchanges The message exchanges, performed to configure and terminate IPCP, are quite similar to those used for LCP.">Figure 10-3</a> to <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#ppp_link_control_protocol_lcp_message_ex" title="Figure 10-1. PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) message exchanges This diagram shows the different message exchanges performed by LCP during link configuration, maintenance, and termination.">Figure 10-1</a>, which shows the messaging for LCP.) Like LCP, each NCP performs functions for link setup, maintenance, and termination, except that it deals only with its particular type of NCP link and not the overall LCP link. Each NCP uses a subset of the following seven of the message types defined in LCP in very much the same way that LCP uses each message type of the same name, as shown for each of these three main link activities:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0483"/></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Configuration</strong></span> The process of setting up and negotiating the parameters of a particular NCP link (once an LCP link is established) is accomplished using Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, and Configure-Reject messages as discussed for LCP (except that these are particular to each NCP). The configuration options are the network layer protocol parameters being negotiated.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Maintenance</strong></span> Code-Reject messages can be sent to indicate invalid code values (NCP frame types).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Termination</strong></span> An NCP link can be terminated using Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack messages. But remember that NCP links are set up within an LCP link, and that there can be more than one NCP link open. Closing NCP links doesn't terminate the LCP link. (NCP links do not need to be closed when an LCP link is terminated.)</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#ppp_ip_control_protocol_ipcp_message_exc" title="Figure 10-3. PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) message exchanges The message exchanges, performed to configure and terminate IPCP, are quite similar to those used for LCP.">Figure 10-3</a> shows how the overall operation of the NCPs, such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0484"/>IPCP, is very similar to that of LCP. Once LCP configuration (including authentication) is complete, IPCP Configure-Request and Configure-Ack messages are used to establish an IPCP link. IP data can then be sent over the link. If the IPCP connection is no longer needed, it may be terminated, after which the LCP link remains open for other types of data to be transmitted. It is not necessary, however, to explicitly terminate the IPCP link before terminating the LCP connection.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ppp_ip_control_protocol_ipcp_message_exc"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e11033"/><img alt="PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) message exchanges The message exchanges, performed to configure and terminate IPCP, are quite similar to those used for LCP." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages287737.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-3. PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) message exchanges The message exchanges, performed to configure and terminate IPCP, are quite similar to those used for LCP.</p></div><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-61"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Once the primary PPP link is established using LCP, each network layer protocol to be carried over the link requires the establishment of the appropriate NCP link.

When <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0487"/>PPP is set up to carry IP datagrams, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0488"/>IPCP is invoked in the network layer protocol phase to set up an IP NCP link between the two devices. The setup is carried out using the four Configure- messages. For IP, two configuration options can be specified in an IPCP Configure-Request message:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IP Compression Protocol</strong></span> Allows devices to negotiate the use of Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression, which shrinks the size of TCP and IP headers to save bandwidth. This is similar in concept to the Protocol-Field-Compression and ACFC options in LCP.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IP Address</strong></span> Allows the device sending the Configure-Request message either to specify an IP address it wants to use for routing IP over the PPP link or to request that the other device supply it with one. This is most commonly used for dial-up networking links.</p><p>Once configuration is complete, data can be sent for the layer 3 protocol corresponding to the NCP negotiated. This is indicated by using the appropriate value for the Protocol field in PPP data frames containing that layer 3 data.</p></div></div>

For example, suppose you connect two machines in your office with a serial cable and want to run PPP between them. When one of these initiates a PPP link with the other, you don't really need to worry about who's calling. On the other hand, consider an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0489"/>Internet service provider (ISP) using PPP for remote dial-in users. They generally want to allow only their customers to connect.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0490"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0491"/></p><p>The PPP protocol suite allows for the use of an optional authentication protocol when devices negotiate the basic link setup. The PPP suite initially defined two such protocols: PAP and CHAP. Once an LCP link is set up between two devices, a series of authentication messages are sent using these protocols to verify the identity of the device initiating the link. Only if authentication is successful can the link configuration proceed.</p><div class="sect2" title="PAP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pap"/>PAP</h2></div></div></div><p>PAP is a very straightforward authentication scheme, consisting of only two basic steps, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10s03.html#pap_authentication_pap_uses_a_simple_exc" title="Figure 10-4. PAP authentication PAP uses a simple exchange of a request containing name and password information and a reply indicating whether or not authentication was successful.">Figure 10-4</a>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Authentication Request</strong></span> The initiating device sends an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0492"/>Authenticate-Request message that contains a name and a password.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Authentication Reply</strong></span> The responding device looks at the name and password and decides whether to accept the initiating device and continue setting up the link. If so, it sends back an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0493"/>Authenticate-Ack message. Otherwise, it sends an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0494"/>Authenticate-Nak message.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0495"/>PAP is another example of something that is just too simple for its own good. Chief among its flaws is that it transmits the user name and password in clear text across the link. This is a big "no-no" because eavesdroppers can get the password.</p><p>PAP also provides no protection against various security attacks. For example, an unauthorized user could try different passwords indefinitely until he discovered the correct one. PAP also puts control of the authentication squarely on the shoulders of the initiating device (usually a client machine), which is not considered desirable, because this is normally a server function that administrators prefer to manage.</p><div class="figure"><a id="pap_authentication_pap_uses_a_simple_exc"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e11140"/><img alt="PAP authentication PAP uses a simple exchange of a request containing name and password information and a reply indicating whether or not authentication was successful." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages287739.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-4. PAP authentication PAP uses a simple exchange of a request containing name and password information and a reply indicating whether or not authentication was successful.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="CHAP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="chap"/>CHAP</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0496"/>The most important difference between PAP and CHAP is that CHAP doesn't transmit the password across the link. When using PAP, the initiator (calling client) sends the authenticator (generally the server that is deciding whether to grant authentication) a message saying essentially, "Here's the password I know; see if it matches yours." Each device uses the password to perform a cryptographic computation, and then checks to see if it gets the same result. If so, they know they have the same password.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-0497"/></p><p>In CHAP, a basic LCP link is first set up between the initiator and authenticator. The authenticator then takes charge of the authentication process, using a technique called a <span class="emphasis"><em>three-way handshake</em></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-47"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Three-way handshakes are a fairly common general authentication procedure.

The Response is calculated based on the password, but the content of the Response is encrypted, and thus it's much harder to derive the password from. CHAP also provides protection against replay attacks, whereby an unauthorized user captures a message and tries to send it again later on. This is done by changing an identifier in each message and varying the challenge text.

However, PPP's popularity is based not just on its highly capable link establishment and management <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0505"/>features, but it also has a number of very useful features that provide important security and performance benefits to network users.</p><p>In this chapter, I describe the protocols that implement several of the most common extra features in PPP. I begin with a discussion of PPP link quality monitoring. I describe the sets of protocols used to configure and implement data compression and data encryption. I then discuss the PPP Multilink Protocol (MP, MLPPP), which allows PPP to bundle multiple low-speed links into a single high-speed link. I also cover the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Bandwidth Allocation Control Protocol (BACP)</em></span>, which are used to manage the operation of MLPPP.</p><div class="sect1" title="PPP Link Quality Monitoring and Reporting (LQM, LQR)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ppp_link_quality_monitoring_and_reportin"/>PPP Link Quality Monitoring and Reporting (LQM, LQR)</h1></div></div></div><p>PPP includes optional authentication in recognition of the varying <span class="emphasis"><em>security</em></span> needs of the many different kinds of links over which PPP may operate. These links also differ greatly in terms of their <span class="emphasis"><em>quality</em></span>. Just as you don't need to worry about authentication much when two machines are linked with a short cable, you also can feel pretty confident that data sent between them is going to arrive intact. Now contrast that with a PPP session established over a long-distance telephone call. For that matter, how about PPP over a dial-up call using an analog cellular phone?</p><p>PPP includes in its basic package a provision for detecting errors in sent frames, and higher-layer protocols like TCP also include methods of providing robustness on noisy lines. These techniques allow a link to tolerate problems, but provide little in the way of useful information about what the status of the link is. In some situations, devices may want to be able to keep track of how well the link is working, and perhaps take action on it. For example, a device experiencing too many errors on a dial-up connection might want to cut off and retry a new call. In some cases, a device might want to try an alternate method of attachment if the current physical link is not working well.</p><p>Recognizing this need, the PPP suite includes a feature that allows devices to analyze the quality of the link between them. This is called <span class="emphasis"><em>PPP Link Quality Monitoring</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>LQM</em></span>. PPP is set up generically to allow any number of different monitoring functions to be used, but at present, there is only one, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Link Quality Reporting (LQR)</em></span>. LQR allows a device to request that its peer (the other device on the link) keep track of statistics about the link and send periodic reports about them.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0506"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0507"/></p><div class="sect2" title="LQR Setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="lqr_setup"/>LQR Setup</h2></div></div></div><p>Before LQR can be used, it must be set up, which is done by LCP as part of the negotiation of basic link parameters in the Link Establishment phase (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PPP CORE PROTOCOLS: LINK CONTROL, NETWORK CONTROL, AND AUTHENTICATION">Chapter 10</a>). The device opening the link requests link monitoring by including the Quality Protocol configuration option in its Configure-Request frame. The configuration option also specifies a <span class="emphasis"><em>reporting period</em></span> that indicates the longest period of time that the requesting device wants to go between receiving reports.</p><p>Assuming that the negotiation is successful, LQR will be enabled. A number of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0508"/>counters are set up that keep track of various link statistics, and a timer is used to regulate the sending of quality reports over the link. Each time the timer expires, a link quality report is generated and sent in a PPP frame over the link using the special PPP Protocol field hexadecimal value 0xC025.</p><p>Each counter holds information about a different statistic regarding the use of the link. Each counter is reset to zero when LQR is set up and then incremented each time a transmission is made or an event occurs that is relevant to the counter. The statistics tracked include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The number of frames sent or received</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of octets (bytes) in all frames sent or received</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of errors that have occurred</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of frames that had to be discarded</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of link quality reports generated</p></li></ul></div><p>These counters are reset only at the start of the link, so they contain figures that are kept cumulatively over the life of the connection. The counters can be used in the absolute sense, meaning that the counter value itself is reported. Alternatively, they can be expressed as relative (or <span class="emphasis"><em>delta</em></span>) values, which represent the change since the last report. This is done when a report is received, simply by subtracting the previous report's numbers from the ones in the current report.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Link Quality Reports"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_link_quality_reports"/>Using Link Quality Reports</h2></div></div></div><p>LQR specifies the quality reporting mechanism, but not specific standards for link quality, since these are so implementation-dependent.

<div class="sect1" title="PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) and Compression Algorithms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ppp_compression_control_protocol_ccp_and"/>PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) and Compression Algorithms</h1></div></div></div><p>PPP is primarily used to provide data link layer connectivity to physical serial links. One of the biggest problems with serial links compared to many other types of layer 1 connections is that they are relatively slow. Consider that while 10 Mbps regular Ethernet is considered sluggish by modern LAN standards, it is actually much faster than most serial lines used for WAN connectivity, which can be ten, one hundred, or even one thousand times slower.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0509"/></p><p>One way to improve performance over serial links is to compress the data sent over the line. Depending on the data transferred, this can double the performance compared to uncompressed transmissions, and can, in some cases, do even better than that. For this reason, many hardware devices include the ability to compress the data stream at the physical layer. The best example of this is probably the set of compression protocols used on analog modems.</p><p>Some physical links don't provide any compression capabilities, but could still benefit from it. To this end, an optional compression feature was created for PPP. It is implemented using the following two distinct protocol components:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)</strong></span> This protocol is responsible for negotiating and managing the use of compression on a PPP link.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0510"/>PPP Compression Algorithms</strong></span> A set of compression algorithms that perform the actual compression and decompression of data. Several of these are defined in RFCs. In addition, it is possible for two devices to negotiate the use of a proprietary compression method if they want to use one that isn't defined by a public standard.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-63"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> PPP includes an optional compression feature that can improve performance over slow physical links. A variety of different compression algorithms are supported. To enable compression, both devices on a PPP link use the <span class="emphasis"><em>PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)</em></span> to negotiate a compression algorithm to use. The compression algorithm is then used to compress and decompress PPP data frames.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="CCP Operation: Compression Setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ccp_operation_compression_setup"/>CCP Operation: Compression Setup</h2></div></div></div><p>When most people talk about compression in PPP, they mention CCP, which is considered "the" compression protocol for PPP. However, CCP is actually used only to configure and control the use of compression; in fact, the algorithms do the real work of compressing and decompressing. This separation of powers provides flexibility, because it allows each implementation to choose what type of compression it wants to use.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0511"/></p><p>CCP is analogous to the Network Control Protocols (NCPs) that negotiate parameters specific to a network layer protocol sent on the link. An NCP lets two devices decide how they will carry layer 3 traffic, such as how Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) lets the devices determine how to carry IP. CCP lets two devices decide how they will compress data, in the same basic way.</p><p>Similarly, just as each NCP is like a "light" version of LCP, CCP is like a light version of LCP. It is used to set up a compression connection called a <span class="emphasis"><em>CCP link</em></span> within an LCP link between two devices. Once established, compressed frames can be sent between the two devices. CCP also provides messaging capabilities for managing and eventually terminating a CCP link. Again, this is very similar to how each network layer protocol sets up an NCP link within LCP. A CCP link is maintained independently of any NCP links.</p><p>CCP uses the same subset of seven LCP message types that the NCPs use, and it adds two additional ones. The use of these <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0512"/>messages for each of the life stages of a CCP link is as follows (this should look familiar if you've read about how the NCPs and LCP work in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PPP CORE PROTOCOLS: LINK CONTROL, NETWORK CONTROL, AND AUTHENTICATION">Chapter 10</a>):</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Configuration</strong></span> Like the NCPs, compression configuration is done once CCP reaches the <span class="emphasis"><em>network layer protocol</em></span> phase. The process of setting up compression and negotiating parameters is accomplished using Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, and Configure-Reject messages, just as it is for LCP, except the configuration options are particular to CCP.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Maintenance</strong></span> Code-Reject messages can be sent to indicate invalid code values in CCP frames. The two new message types are Reset-Request and Reset-Ack, which are used to reset the compression (the CCP link) in the event of a detected failure in decompression.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Termination</strong></span> A CCP link can be terminated using Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack. Again, remember that, like the NCP links, the CCP link is set up within an LCP link, and closing it doesn't terminate the LCP link, which controls <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0513"/>PPP overall.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="CCP Configuration Options and Compression Algorithms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ccp_configuration_options_and_compressio"/>CCP Configuration Options and Compression Algorithms</h2></div></div></div><p>CCP configuration options are used only to negotiate the type of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0514"/>compression to be used by the two devices, and to acquire the specifics of how that algorithm is to be employed. The device initiating the negotiation sends a Configure-Request with one option for each of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0515"/>compression algorithms it supports. The other device compares this list of options to the algorithms it understands. It also checks for any specific details relevant to the option to see if it agrees on how that algorithm should be used. It then sends back the appropriate reply (Ack, Nak, or Reject), and a negotiation ensues until the two devices come up with a common algorithm that both understand.

This can be done at higher layers using something like IPsec, but PPP also provides an optional feature that allows data to be encrypted and decrypted at the data link layer itself using two protocol components:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP)</strong></span> This protocol is responsible for negotiating and managing the use of encryption on a PPP link.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0520"/>PPP <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0521"/>Encryption Algorithms</strong></span> A family of encryption algorithms that perform the actual encryption and decryption of data.

This technique allows each implementation to choose which type of encryption it wishes to use.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0523"/></p><p>The original ECP defined only a single encryption method, and a couple of others have since been added. Like CCP, ECP is analogous to the NCPs that negotiate parameters specific to a network layer protocol sent on the link, but it deals with how devices encrypt data, rather than how they transport layer 3 traffic. This also means that like the NCPs, ECP is a light version of LCP and works in the same basic way. Once an ECP link is negotiated, devices can send encrypted frames between each other. When no longer needed, the ECP link can be terminated.</p><p>ECP uses the same subset of seven LCP message types that the NCPs use, and it adds two more. The use of these <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0524"/>messages for each of the life stages of an ECP link is as follows:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0525"/>Configuration</strong></span> Like the NCPs (and also like CCP, of course), encryption configuration is done once ECP reaches the <span class="emphasis"><em>network layer protocol</em></span> phase. The process of setting up encryption and negotiating parameters is accomplished using Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, and Configure-Reject messages, as I explained in the description of LCP in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PPP CORE PROTOCOLS: LINK CONTROL, NETWORK CONTROL, AND AUTHENTICATION">Chapter 10</a>, except the configuration options are particular to ECP.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Maintenance</strong></span> Code-Reject messages can be sent to indicate invalid code values in ECP frames. The two new message types are Reset-Request and Reset-Ack, which are used to reset the encryption (the ECP link) in the event of a detected failure in decryption.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link Termination</strong></span> An ECP link can be terminated using Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack. Again, remember that like the NCP links, the ECP link is set up within an LCP link, so closing it doesn't terminate the LCP link.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="ECP Configuration Options and Encryption Algorithms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ecp_configuration_options_and_encryption"/>ECP Configuration Options and Encryption Algorithms</h2></div></div></div><p>ECP configuration options are used solely to negotiate the type of encryption algorithm that will be used by the two devices and the specifics of how that algorithm will be employed.

The other device compares this list of options to the algorithms it understands. It also checks for any details relevant to the option to see if it agrees on how that algorithm should be used. It then sends back the appropriate reply (Ack, Nak, or Reject), and a negotiation ensues until the two devices come up with a common algorithm that they both understand.

However, there are some situations for which there may actually be two layer 1 connections between the same pair of devices. This may seem strange. Why would there be more than one link between any pair of machines?</p><p>There are a number of situations in which this can occur. A common one is when two links are intentionally placed between a pair of devices. This is often done to increase performance by widening the pipe between two devices, without going to a newer, more expensive technology. For example, if two machines are connected to each other using a regular analog modem that's too slow, a relatively simple solution is to use two analog modem pairs connecting the machines to double bandwidth.</p><p>A slightly different situation occurs when multiplexing creates the equivalent of several physical layer channels between two devices, even if they have only one hardware link between them. Consider <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0530"/>ISDN, for example. The most common form of ISDN service (ISDN <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0531"/>basic rate interface or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0532"/>BRI) creates two 64,000 bps <span class="emphasis"><em>B channels</em></span> between a pair of devices. These B channels are time division multiplexed and carried along with a D channel on a single pair of copper wire, but to the devices, they appear <span class="emphasis"><em>as if</em></span> there were two physical layer links between devices, each of which carries 64 Kbps of data. And the ISDN <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0533"/>primary rate interface (PRI) actually creates 23 or more channels, all between the same pair of hardware devices.</p><p>In a situation where you have multiple links, you could just establish PPP over each connection independently. However, this is far from an ideal solution, because you would then have to manually distribute the traffic over the two (or more) channels or links that connect them. If you wanted to connect to the Internet, you would need to make separate connections and then choose which one to use for each action. That isn't exactly a recipe for fun, and what's worse is that you could never use all the bandwidth for a single purpose, such as downloading the latest 100 MB Microsoft security patch.</p><p>What you really want is a solution that will let you combine multiple links and use them as if they were one high-performance link. Some hardware devices actually allow thisto be done at the hardware level itself. In ISDN, this technology is sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>bonding</em></span> when done at layer 1. For those hardware units that don't provide this capability, PPP makes it available in the form of the PPP Multilink Protocol (MP).

Here is what it does for each direction of communication:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Transmission</strong></span> MP accepts datagrams received from any of the network layer protocols configured using appropriate NCPs. It first encapsulates them into a modified version of the regular PPP frame, and then takes that frame and decides how to transmit it over the multiple physical links. Typically, this is done by dividing the frame into <span class="emphasis"><em>fragments</em></span> that are evenly spread out over the set of links. These are then encapsulated and sent over the physical links. However, you can also implement an alternative strategy as well, such as alternating full-sized frames between the links. Also, smaller frames typically aren't fragmented, and neither are control frames such as the ones used for link configuration.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Reception</strong></span> MP takes the fragments received from all physical links and reassembles them into the original PPP frame. That frame is then processed like any PPP frame by looking at its Protocol field and passing it to the appropriate network layer protocol.</p><p>The fragments used in MP are similar in concept to IP fragments, but of course these are different protocols running at different layers. To PPP or MP, an IP fragment is just an IP datagram like any other.</p><p>The fragmenting of data in MP introduces a number of complexities that the protocol must handle. For example, since fragments are being sent roughly concurrently, you need to identify them with a sequence number to facilitate reassembly. You also need some control information to identify the first and last fragments. A special frame format is used for MP fragments to carry this extra information. I describe this in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PPP PROTOCOL FRAME FORMATS">Chapter 12</a>, which also contains more information about how fragmenting is accomplished, as well as an illustration that demonstrates how it works.</p></div></div>

This offers tremendous advantages to many PPP users, because it lets them make optimal use of all their bandwidth, especially for applications such as Internet connectivity. It's no surprise, then, that MP has become one of the most popular features of PPP.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0539"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0540"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0541"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0542"/></p><p>The original standard defining MP basically assumed that multiple links would be combined into a single bundle. For example, if you had two modem links, they would both be connected and then combined, or two B channels in an ISDN link would be combined. After MP was set up, the bundle would be available for either device to use in its entirety.</p><p>There's one drawback to this system: The fat pipe is always enabled, and in many cases, it is expensive to have this set up all the time. It often costs more to connect two or more layer 1 links than a single one, and it's not always needed. For example, some ISDN services charge per minute for calls on either of the B channels. In the case of modem dial-up, there are per-minute charges in some parts of the world. Even where regular phone calls are free, there is a cost in the form of tying up a phone line. Consider that in many applications, the amount of bandwidth needed varies over time.</p><p>It would be better if you could set up MP so that it could dynamically add links to the bundle when needed (such as when you decided to download some large files), and then automatically drop them when no longer required. This enhancement to the basic MP package was provided in the form of a pair of new protocols described in RFC 2125:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-0543"/>BAP)</strong></span> Describes a mechanism where either device communicating over an MP bundle of layer 1 links may request that a link be added to the bundle or removed from it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bandwidth Allocation Control Protocol (BACP)</strong></span> Allows devices to configure how they want to use BAP.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-66"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>BAP</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>BACP</em></span> are used to provide dynamic control over how PPP MP functions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="BACP Operation: Configuring the Use of BAP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bacp_operation_configuring_the_use_of_ba"/>BACP Operation: Configuring the Use of BAP</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's start with BACP, since it is the protocol used for the initial setup of the feature. BACP is very similar conceptually to all those other PPP protocols with "Control" in their names, such as LCP, the NCP family, CCP, and ECP, but is actually even simpler. It is used only during link configuration to set up BAP. This is done using Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, and Configure-Reject messages, just as described in the LCP topic.</p><p>The only configuration option that is negotiated in BACP is one called Favored-Peer, which is used to ensure that a problem does not occur if the two devices on the link try to send the same request at the same time. If both devices support BAP, then the BACP negotiation will succeed and BAP will be activated.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="BAP Operation: Adding and Removing Links"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bap_operation_adding_and_removing_links"/>BAP Operation: Adding and Removing Links</h2></div></div></div><p>BAP defines a set of messages that can be sent between devices to add or drop links to and from the current PPP bundle. What's particularly interesting about BAP is that it includes the tools necessary to have a device actually initiate different types of physical layer connections (such as dialing a modem for bundled analog links or enabling an extra ISDN channel) when more bandwidth is required. It then shuts them down when they're no longer needed.</p><p>Here's a brief description of the BAP message types:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Call-Request and Call-Response</strong></span> When one device on the link wants to add a link to the bundle and initiate the new physical layer link itself, it sends a Call-Request frame to tell the other device, which replies with a Call-Response.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Callback-Request and Callback-Response</strong></span> These are just like the two previous message types, except that they're used when a device wants its peer (the other device on the link) to initiate the call to add a new link. So, if Device A says, "I need more bandwidth but I want you to call me, instead of me calling you," it sends Device B a Callback-Request.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Call-Status-Indication and Call-Status-Response</strong></span> After a device attempts to add a new link to the bundle (after sending a Call-Request or receiving a Callback-Request), it reports the status of the new link using the Call-Status-Indication frame. The other device then replies with a Call-Status-Response.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Link-Drop-Query-Request and Link-Drop-Query-Response</strong></span> One device uses these messages to request that a link be dropped, and the other uses them to respond to that request.</p><p>Note that the decision of when to add or remove links is not made by these protocols. It is left up to the particular implementation.</p></div></div>

Each of these packages information into messages called <span class="emphasis"><em>frames</em></span>, each of which follows a particular <span class="emphasis"><em>frame format</em></span>. PPP starts with a general frame format that encompasses all frames sent on the link and then includes more specific formats for different purposes. Understanding these formats not only makes diagnosing PPP issues easier, but also helps make more clear how the key PPP protocols function.</p><p>In this chapter, I illustrate the most common frame formats used for sending both data and control information over PPP. I begin with an explanation of the overall format used for all PPP frames. I also describe the general format used for the various control protocols and the option format that most of them use. (One of the nice things about PPP is that so many of the protocols use control frames with a common format.)</p><p>I then specifically list the frames used for Link Control Protocol (LCP) and the authentication protocols (PAP and CHAP). I also describe the special format used by the PPP Multilink Protocol (MP) to transport fragments of data over bundled links.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-53"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Due to the sheer number of different protocols in PPP (dozens) and the fact that many have their own unique options, I won't describe all the specific frame formats and option formats for every protocol in detail here.

The fields are the Address and Control fields. Why bother sending two bytes that have the same value for every frame and aren't used for anything? Originally, they were maintained for compatibility, but this reduces efficiency.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0554"/></p><p>To avoid wasting two bytes in every frame, it is possible during initial link setup using the Link Control Protocol (LCP) for the two devices on the link to negotiate a feature called <span class="emphasis"><em>Address and Control Field Compression (ACFC)</em></span> using the LCP option by that same name. When enabled, this feature simply <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0555"/>causes these two fields not to be sent for most PPP frames (but not for LCP control frames). In fact, the feature would be better named <span class="emphasis"><em>Address and Control Field Suppression</em></span>, because the fields are just suppressed and compressed down to nothing.</p><p>Even when devices agree to use field compression, they must still be capable of receiving both compressed and uncompressed frames. They differentiate one from the other by looking at the first two bytes after the initial Flag field. If they contain the value 0xFF03, they must be the Address and Control fields; otherwise, those fields were suppressed. (The value 0xFF03 is not a valid Protocol field value, so there is no chance of ambiguity.)</p><p>Similarly, it is also possible for the two devices on the link to negotiate compression of the Protocol field, so it takes only one byte instead of two. This is done generally by dropping the first byte if it is zero, a process called <span class="emphasis"><em>Protocol Field Compression (PFC)</em></span>. Recall that the first byte must be even and the second odd. Thus, a receiving device examines the evenness of the first byte of the Protocol field in each frame. If it is odd, this means that a leading byte of zeros in the Protocol field has been suppressed, because the first byte of a full two-byte Protocol value must be even.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-54"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This field compression (really suppression) has nothing to do with data compression using PPP's Compression Control Protocol (CCP) and compression algorithms.</em></span></p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="PPP General Control Protocol Frame Format and Option Format"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ppp_general_control_protocol_frame_forma"/>PPP General Control Protocol Frame Format and Option Format</h1></div></div></div><p>The general frame format you just saw is used for all of the many frame types defined in the PPP protocol suite. Within that format, the Information field carries either encapsulated layer 3 user data or encapsulated control messages. These control messages contain specific information that is used to configure, manage, and discontinue PPP links, and to implement the various features that comprise PPP.</p><p>There are many different PPP control protocols that usually can be distinguished by the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Control</em></span> appearing their names. These include the main PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP); a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) such as IPCP, IPXCP, and so forth; and also control protocols for implementing features, such as the Compression Control Protocol (CCP) and the Encryption Control Protocol (ECP). The authentication protocols Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) lack Control in the name but also fall into this category.</p><p>The control protocols each use control messages in a slightly different way, but there is also a great deal of commonality between the messages. This is because, as I explained in my discussions of the PPP protocols, most of the control protocols—such as the NCP family, CCP, and ECP—are implemented as subsets of the functionality of the LCP. They perform many of the same functions, so the PPP designers wisely adapted the LCP messaging system for these other control protocols.</p><p>This all means that <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0556"/>control protocol frames have a common format that fits within the overall general frame format in PPP. Even protocols like PAP and CHAP, which aren't based on LCP, use this general control frame format, which is described in <a class="xref" href="ch12s02.html#ppp_control_message_format" title="Table 12-4. PPP Control Message Format">Table 12-4</a>.</p><div class="table"><a id="ppp_control_message_format"/><p class="title">Table 12-4. PPP Control Message Format</p><div class="table-contents"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " summary="PPP Control Message Format"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Field Name</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Size (Bytes)</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Code (Type)</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>A single byte value that indicates what type of control message is in this control frame.

<div class="sect1" title="PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) Frame Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ppp_link_control_protocol_lcp_frame_form"/>PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) Frame Formats</h1></div></div></div><p>You just explored the general format used by the various protocols in PPP that exchange control messages. Of the many control protocols in PPP, LCP is the most important, because it is responsible for basic PPP link setup and operation. It is also the protocol used as a template for many of the other control protocols.</p><p>Since it is so central to PPP, and since many of the other protocols use a similar messaging system, let's make the general frame format (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch12s02.html#ppp_control_message_option_format-id002" title="Figure 12-5. PPP control message option format">Figure 12-5</a>) more concrete by showing the specific frame formats used for each of the LCP control frames. There are 13 different frame formats, however, and since they have many fields in common I've combined them into a single large summary table. <a class="xref" href="ch12s03.html#ppp_link_control_protocol_lcp_frame_type" title="Table 12-7. PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) Frame Types and Fields">Table 12-7</a> shows the contents and meaning for each of the fields in the 13 LCP frame types.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-56"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>LCP frame types 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 allow an additional amount of data to be included in the Data field in a manner not strictly described by the protocol. The PPP standard says that there may be zero or more octets that "contain uninterpreted data for use by the sender" and "may consist of any binary value" (RFC 1661). The inclusion of this uninterpreted data is left as an implementation-dependent option.</em></span></p></div><p>All LCP control frames are encapsulated into a PPP frame by placing the frame structure into its Information field, as you saw earlier. The Protocol field is set to 0xC021 for LCP.

In either case, PPP MP can be used to aggregate the bandwidth of these physical links to create a single, high-speed <span class="emphasis"><em>bundle</em></span>. I describe how this is done in <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. PPP FEATURE PROTOCOLS">Chapter 11</a>.</p><p>After MP is configured and starts working, it operates by employing a strategy for dividing up regular PPP <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0566"/>frames among the many individual physical links that compose the MP bundle. This is usually accomplished by chopping up the PPP frames into pieces called <span class="emphasis"><em>fragments</em></span> and spreading them across the physical links.
