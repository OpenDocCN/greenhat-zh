<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In order to get connected to the Internet, you have to have the hardware to do it.  There are a number of possible ways to do this, ranging from the higher-speed  local area networks (LANs), cable modems, and ADSL connections from phone  companies. Most computers also have internal 56 Kbps modems or can connect to  external modems for slower dial-up connections over regular phone lines.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you have a high-speed Internet connection from your cable television or  phone company, or if you are connected to the Net by a LAN system at your  office, you are really in luck, as these setups are probably the easiest to deal with. Most likely, all you have to do is connect the Ethernet cable from the wall (if you  are using a LAN), or from your cable modem, to the port of the network card on  your machine. After that, once you start up your machine you will be ready to go. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you have a problem getting online, and you are trying to connect to the Net via  a LAN or cable modem, the problem could very likely be that your network card  is not supported by your system. This is easily remedied (by replacing it) and,  fortunately, is relatively rare. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">However, the problem could also be that your network or service provider  does not automatically assign addresses via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  (DHCP). DHCP is a means by which your Internet provider can automatically (dynamically) provide your system with the configuration information it needs in  order to connect to the Internet. If your provider does not utilize DHCP, you will  have to get the necessary information about settings from the network administrator or service provider and enter them yourself. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If this happens to be the boat you are in, you will enter them into the  Network Configuration window. To access this window, go to the Main menu and  select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Network</b>. After you provide the requested root password,  the configuration window will open. Your Ethernet or network card should  already be highlighted, so just click <b class="calibre13">Edit</b>.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Many, if not most, of you are still using dial-up Internet connections, which  means that you need to have a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your  box to the outside world. These modems, in case you’ve forgotten, are those  wonderful machines that whistle, chime, screech, and spit whenever you dial up  your Internet provider. I suppose you could think of them as noisy telephones in  need of a good burp.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The biggest drawback to dealing with modems in Linux is that very few  modems are supported by Linux. On the positive side of things, though, once  you do find a modem that works, it is relatively easy to set up. The main culprit in  the compatibility problem is a beast called the Winmodem. As hardware makers try to bring you cheaper and cheaper machines, they inevitably try to cut costs  here and there. The Winmodem is one of these cost-cutting developments. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Although a Winmodem is, technically speaking, a piece of hardware, it is a  far cry from what is known as a hardware modem. A hardware modem is, to oversimplify things a bit, a telephone without a handset and dial that plugs in to  your computer somewhere. It is a fully functioning machine that only needs your  system for dial-up and connection information. A Winmodem, on the other  hand, is totally system dependent. It is a faux modem that has more in common  with a lamprey than a telephone, in that it must utilize the Windows system in  order to do its chores. As you are not using a Windows system when you are using  Linux, you are sort of sunk, as the Winmodem has nothing to utilize. The fact  that most of a Winmodem’s work is done by the system itself means that it is a  very simple piece of hardware. This means, of course, that Winmodems are  much cheaper to produce than true hardware modems. That being the case,  you can be fairly sure that if you have a built-in modem in your machine, it is a  Winmodem.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with these Winmodem beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. When they do work, Winmodems are called Linmodems, but support for the wide variety of  modem models is still rather spotty. If you are not sure what kind of modem you  have installed, my advice would be to go through the Internet connection setup  process to see if your modem works or not. If it doesn’t, you can replace the  modem with one that is known to work, preferably a true hardware modem.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Probably the best way to find out what modems do work with Linux is to go  to one of the online forums, such as Linux Questions (<a target="_top" href="http://www.linuxquestions.org">www.linuxquestions.org</a>) or JustLinux (<a target="_top" href="http://www.justlinux.com">www.justlinux.com</a>), and ask for suggestions. The US Robotics  models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal slot) and 56 PC Card <a name="165" id="165"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Modem (PC Card slot, for notebooks) are both true hardware modems that are  easily available and said to work, though I must admit that I haven’t tried these  myself. You can check out the US Robotics site for more information on these  models (<a target="_top" href="http://www.usr.com">www.usr.com</a>). </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre11">When purchasing a modem, beware of generic, no-name internal modems that say they are Linux compatible. Check out the Internet first to verify such a claim. Sometimes, such  modems are only compatible after you do all sorts of dreadful things to your system that even  a hard-core Linux geek wouldn’t want to bother with. A cute little Tux icon on the box doesn’t necessarily mean that the modem is Tux-friendly. It might just be that the poor bird  was hoodwinked.</i>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The best solution if you are going to use a modem with your Linux system is to  use an external serial modem. An external modem sits in a box outside your  computer, and it connects to the serial port in the back of the computer, which  is the one that looks like a hole with little prongs in it (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU32">Figure 4-2</a>). Because  the modem doesn’t use your operating system to operate, it does not tie up  system resources while it’s busy, which may result in a possible pickup in  computer speed.</p>
<div class="calibre10">
<a name="168" id="168"/><a name="figure.DDU32" id="figure.DDU32"/><span><a href="0402_0.jpg" name="IMG_33" target="_parent" id="IMG_33"><img src="0402.jpg" alt="Click To expand" border="0" class="calibre40"/></a></span>
<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 4-2: </span> Serial port and connector</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Most external serial modems should work with your system, or at least that is what  most people will tell you. If you are worried and are looking for a sure thing,  Zoom Telephonics (<a target="_top" href="http://www.zoom.com">www.zoom.com</a>) makes an external serial modem that is compatible with Linux, and they say so right on their site. The US Robotics 56KV.92 External Faxmodem is also said to work, though I haven’t tried this model  out myself.<a name="169" id="169"/><a name="IDX-56" id="IDX-56"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you find another model that you think will do the trick, before you commit  to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo or Google search with that modem’s  make and model number, along with the word “Linux,” and see what search results you get. Of course, you can also try out one of the Linux forums and ask  about the modem make and model there. There are a lot of people in the same  boat as you, so you are sure to get plenty of opinions and advice.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">So let’s say that you finally get a modem that is supposed to work with your Linux  system. What you have to do now is make sure that your system recognizes it. To set it up, connect your modem to the computer and to the telephone jack in the  wall. Turn the modem on (if it’s an external modem) and then start up your  machine. If all is as it should be, Fedora will automatically find and configure  your modem. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">However, you may first have to go through a couple of very simple steps to  configure your modem soon after you start up your machine. If so, you will see a  semi-graphical screen telling you that Kudzu (the Red Hat hardware browser)  has found a new piece of hardware. To configure the new device, just press any  key to continue and then press ENTER to configure it. That’s all there is to it.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Your modem is now all set up and ready to go, but before it can actually go anywhere, virtually speaking, you will have to set things up so that it can dial up  your Internet provider. This is pretty easy to do, and through this process you can  also make sure that your modem actually works with your system.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There is a way to set this up via GNOME, it isn’t really as smooth or satisfactory as using KPPP, which is the KDE Internet dialer. KDE applications will work within GNOME, so don’t worry about that point. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get to KPPP, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Internet </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More Internet  Applications </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> KPPP</b>. After that, you will be prompted for your root password, so  type that in and click <b class="calibre13">OK;</b> the KPPP window will soon appear (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU33">Figure 4-3</a>). </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is where the tab feature comes in handy. To see how it works, try it out  yourself right here and now. Open your Mozilla browser by clicking the Mozilla  launcher on the GNOME Panel; then go to <a target="_top" href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> and do a search for <span>metro boiling frogs</span>, for a fun example. Once the results are shown, right-click  on the top link, and in the pop-up menu select<b class="calibre13"> Open Link in New Tab </b>(see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU39">Figure 4-10</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have done this, the new page will appear in a new tab, and your  original page of search results is still there, ready and waiting in the other tab  (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU40">Figure 4-11</a>). I am pretty confident in saying that, once you get used to this feature, you will never miss your old Internet Explorer again.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can also set up Mozilla to open pages in a new tab when you type in a URL.  Just go to the<b class="calibre13"> Edit</b> menu and select <b class="calibre13">Preferences</b>. In the Preferences window, click  <b class="calibre13">Tabbed Browsing</b> in the pane on the left side of the window, and then check the  checkbox next to <b class="calibre13">Control+Enter in the Location Bar</b>. While you are there, you  might as well also check the box next to <b class="calibre13">Middle-click or Control-click of links in a  Web page</b>. Once you have done that, just click<b class="calibre13"> OK</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now when you type in a URL and then simultaneously press the CTRL and  ENTER keys, the new page will open up in a new tab rather than the same window.  Also, if you press the CTRL key while clicking a link, it too will open up in a new tab (or if you have a three-button mouse, clicking the middle button alone will  do the same trick) — a variation on the right-click method.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The more recent versions of Mozilla, which come with Fedora Core, have a  handy new feature called the Popup Manager. When you first come to a Web  page that shoots out one of those annoying pop-up windows, Mozilla will bring  up a dialog box to ask you if you want to set up your preferences to suppress the  appearance of such windows. If you opt to use this feature, the Preferences will  open to the Popup Windows section where you can do away with most of those  pesky nuisances (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU41">Figure 4-12</a>). You can still allow pop-ups for sites that you  specify by clicking the <b class="calibre13">Allowed Sites</b> button. Needless to say, this is an extremely  useful, effective, and welcome feature.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Mozilla not only lets you view Web pages, it lets you make them as well. Mozilla  Composer (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU42">Figure 4-13</a> on the next page) is a rather simple, but  powerful enough, HTML editor. It is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get,  pronounced <i class="calibre11">wiz-ee-wig</i>) editor, which means that you can see what your page will  look like as you build it — you don’t have to learn or deal with HTML coding (unless you want to, of course).

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Evolution is the default email program in Fedora Core, and it could probably  best be described as a better-groomed, spunkier clone of Outlook (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU43">Figure 4-14</a>). It allows you to send and receive mail, make appointments, and  keep a list of tasks. It can also display weather conditions for a wide variety of  cities around the world and news headlines from a variety of sources, all of which  is customizable in the program settings. By providing direct access to information  of this kind, it does Outlook one better. It is also a much more handsome  program to look at than Outlook, and the more recent versions, which ship with  Fedora Core, look even better than their predecessors. <a name="197" id="197"/><a name="IDX-64" id="IDX-64"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To use Evolution, just click the email launcher on the GNOME Panel or go  to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Internet </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Evolution Email</b>. When you first run  Evolution, you will be greeted by a setup wizard, so have the account details you  received from your Internet service provider handy. These should consist of your  POP host address (for receiving mail), your SMTP host address (for sending  mail), and your mail password, which is very often different from your Internet  logon password. Your mail password is not actually entered during the various  wizard steps, so check the <b class="calibre13">Remember this password </b>checkbox when filling in the POP details. When you first connect to your mail server, you will be prompted for  your mail password, so you can type it in at that time and you won’t have to deal  with it again. </p>

</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Evolution is, without a doubt, the most popular email software in the Linux  world, but despite its obvious attractions and popularity, I prefer the more  straightforward Mozilla Mail for my email chores. In contrast to the multi- functional Evolution, Mozilla Mail is a mail-only program that is very straightforward to use. It is also the program you want to use if you have to deal with mail  in multiple character sets (English and Japanese, for example), as Evolution  seems weaker in this area. Mozilla Mail also has a handy and effective Junk Mail  Control feature to help you deal with junk email (spam). If you would like totry out Mozilla Mail, you can run it from the Main menu by selecting<b class="calibre13"> Internet </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  More Internet Applications </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Mozilla Mail</b>. Try both Evolution and Mozilla Mail and use whichever you like better. That’s one of the great things about  Linux: choices.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you find that you prefer Mozilla Mail to Evolution, you can change the  mail launcher in your GNOME Panel to launch Mozilla Mail to make things  easier on yourself. Just right-click the email icon in the panel, and then in the  Properties window, change the name “Evolution Email” to <span>Mozilla Mail</span> and the  command “evolution” to <span>/usr/bin/mozilla -mail</span>. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="200" id="200"/><a name="IDX-65" id="IDX-65"/>Fedora Core allows you to do instant messaging too. It doesn’t matter if you  usually use MSN/Windows Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, AOL Instant  Messenger (AIM), or ICQ; you can set up Gaim, a single application, to check<i class="calibre11"> all </i>of these messaging accounts. The question most people had in the past, however, was<i class="calibre11"> how </i>to set up Gaim to do this — it was, shall we say, less than intuitive. In the  new version of Gaim that ships with Fedora Core, however, things have gotten  much easier, so you are really in luck.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get Gaim set up and ready for action, go to the Main menu and select  <b class="calibre13">Internet </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Instant Messenger</b>. Click the <b class="calibre13">Accounts</b> button, and in the Accounts  window click <b class="calibre13">Add</b>.

<span><span>Figure 4-15: </span> Adding instant messaging accounts to Gaim</span>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">From this point on, setting up Gaim is easy enough to do. First, select the  appropriate protocol for your messaging service in the drop-down menu. Then  type in your screen name (usually the email address under which your messaging  account is registered), your password (your messaging password, that is), and  finally, your alias (the nickname that other people see when you are in their buddy’s list). Once you’ve done all this, click <b class="calibre13">Save</b>, and then close the other  Gaim windows, including the main one. Now run Gaim again, and your new  account will appear in the main Gaim window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU45">Figure 4-16</a>). All you have to  do now is click <b class="calibre13">Sign On</b>, and you will be blabbing in no time.</p>
