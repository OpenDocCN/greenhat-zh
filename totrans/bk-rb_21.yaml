- en: RDoc is the name given to a Ruby source code documentation format and tool.
    The RDoc tool, which comes standard with Ruby, can process Ruby code files and
    Ruby’s C-code class library in order to extract documentation and format it so
    that it can be displayed in, for example, a web browser. You can explicitly add
    RDoc documentation to your own code in the form of source code comments. The RDoc
    tool can also extract elements of the source code to provide the names of classes,
    modules, and methods, along with the names of any arguments required by methods.

- en: 'It is easy to document your own code in a way that is accessible to the RDoc
    processor. Either you write a block of ordinary single-line comments before the
    code being documented (such as a class or method) or you write an embedded multiline
    comment delimited by `=begin rdoc` and `=end`. Note that `rdoc` must follow `=begin`;
    otherwise, the RDoc processor will ignore the comment block:'

- en: The RDoc tool will create a nicely formatted HTML file (*index.html*) with three
    panes at the top and a fourth, larger pane at the bottom. The three top panes
    display the names of the files, classes, and methods, while the bottom pane displays
    the documentation.

- en: The HTML contains hyperlinks so that you can click class and method names to
    navigate to the associated documentation. The documentation is placed into its
    own subdirectory, *\doc*, along with a number of required HTML files and a style
    sheet to apply formatting.

- en: You can add extra formatting to your RDoc comments by placing formatting characters
    around single words or by placing tags around multiple words. Use `*` and `*`
    for bold, `_` and `_` for italic, and `+` and `+` for a monospaced, “typewriter”
    font. The equivalent tags for longer pieces of text are `<b>` and `</b>` for bold,
    `<em>` and `</em>` for italic, and `<tt>` and `</tt>` for typewriter.

    in a variety of ways and output in alternative formats to HTML. If you really
    want to master RDoc, be sure to read the complete documentation, available online
    at [http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html).
