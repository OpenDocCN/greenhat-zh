    any pair of nodes. Large networks can have very complicated structures with many
    branches and extensions, but the core of every network can be reduced to just
    a few patterns. The simplified layout of a network is known as its *topology*.

- en: The most common network topologies are a big loop known as a *ring*; a hub system
    with everything connected to a central core called a *star*, a common path (not
    a loop) that connects nodes using a time-sharing method; and a *mesh*, in which
    there's a direct connection from every node to every other node. [Figure 3-1](ch03.html#every_network_uses_a_specific_topology
    "Figure 3-1. Every network uses a specific topology.") shows simplified diagrams
    of each network topology.

- en: In a loop network, such as IBM's old token ring design, data moves around the
    loop until it reaches its destination. In the much more common hub system, each
    data packet travels to a central location, where a control device reads the address
    and sends it back out to the right destination. Ethernet networks, which include
    most small LANs, are hub systems.

    connections between networks. Unless you're connecting just two nodes, these hubs,

    "Figure 3-2. A hub or switch is the central connection point in an Ethernet network.").
    Each computer or other network node connects to a hub or switch through a cable
    plugged into a socket called a *port*. In a small network, a hub or switch is
    almost always a tabletop box with indicator lights on the front and Ethernet ports
    on the back. In a larger network, the hub or switch might be a panel that mounts
    in an equipment rack.

    hub or switch. You might find a 10 Mbps Ethernet hub, but as faster devices have
    become less expensive, there's not much reason to use one. Today, the most common
    hubs and switches are designed for both 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps operation. The latest
    generation of switches and hubs supports even faster Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps)
    switches, often at prices only slightly higher than those of older 100 Mbps versions.

- en: When a data packet enters a hub, the hub relays that packet to all of the hub's
    ports (and onward to the nodes connected to those ports). Each node compares the
    address on the packet with its own address and either accepts it if the address
    is the same or ignores it if the packet is addressed to some other node. Because
    the hub sends each packet to every port, only one packet can travel through the
    network at a time (we're talking about many packets per second, but they still
    move through the network one at a time). If two or more computers try to send
    packets at exactly the same time, Ethernet's collision detection feature forces
    them to stop, wait, and try again a fraction of a second later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to prevent collisions, each node must examine the network to be certain
    that no other node is already using the hub before it transmits a packet. Therefore,
    a network with a 10/100 hub is no faster than the slowest node. If all the computers
    in your network use 100 Mbps network adapters but the printer connects through
    a 10 Mbps port, the whole network will run at only 10 Mbps or less.

- en: 'As more nodes try to use a hub at the same time, the data transfer speed through
    the entire network drops. This could have a significant effect on a busy network
    that uses a hub: The actual data transfer could be only a fraction of the nominal
    10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.'

- en: In general, hubs are slow, simple, and cheap. But the difference in cost between
    a hub and a switch is often insignificant, so a switch is almost always the better
    choice.

- en: A data switch performs the same function as a hub—it connects the nodes of a
    network to one another—but it does the job quite differently. Rather than sending
    every packet to every port, a switch reads the address section of each incoming
    packet and sets up a direct connection from the source of each packet to its destination.
    In the meantime, if some other node tries to send a data packet to another unused
    port, the switch can set up the link without breaking the other connection. As
    [Figure 3-3](ch03.html#an_ethernet_switch_can_support_two_or_m "Figure 3-3. An
    Ethernet switch can support two or more simultaneous connections.") shows, a switch
    can handle more than one connection at the same time. Because a network node connected
    to a switch doesn't have to monitor the entire network for possible collisions,
    it can send and receive data at the same time (this is called *full duplex* mode).
    Both of these features—multiple segments and full duplex operation—mean that data
    can move through a switch more quickly than through a hub.

    often have four, five, or eight ports, inside a box that can sit on a table or
    shelf, like the one shown in [Figure 3-4](ch03.html#this_switch_connects_five_network_nodes
    "Figure 3-4. This switch connects five network nodes."). When your network expands
    to need more ports than your original switch can provide, you can connect one
    or more additional switches to one of the ports on the original unit.

    All of the computers connected to a LAN can share peripheral devices (such as
    a printer or a scanner), they can run programs and read data from other computers
    on the same LAN, and they all share a common connection to the Internet. In a
    home network, the LAN might also include home entertainment systems and game controllers.

    called a *wide area network (WAN)* that can use communications channels such as

    When the device simply examines the address on each packet and decides which packets
    to forward to the other network, it's a *bridge*. When the device examines the
    address (or routing) information in each packet and sends the packet along to

    LAN. This kind of router is sometimes called a *gateway router* because packets
    from your LAN must pass through it on their way to the Internet (and, of course,
    packets from the Internet also pass through the router on their way to your LAN).
    The most common gateway routers are specifically designed to supply the right
    kind of signaling and address conversion required by DSL or cable TV connections.

    is almost always a better choice than two or more separate pieces. A single unit
    is almost always less costly than separate components because the case and the
