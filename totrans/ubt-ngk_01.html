If you have already made the commitment and have Ubuntu installed on your machine, you are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have made the commitment psychologically but have yet to act on that commitment. And some of you are probably reading these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering about Linux and about whether you should spend your money on this book or on a latté every morning for the next couple of weeks. For those in this last group, I can only say, "Get this book." Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.</p><p>In any case, the first thing we need to do is get you up to snuff on what this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and what you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions along the way and, if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by the time you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, your doubts will be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. Anyway, until you are ready to make the commitment, you can still follow along, because the CD that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience without having to even touch what you have on your hard drive. You can kick back, put your worries in check, and go with the flow.</p><div class="sect1" title="What Is Linux?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_linux_question"/>What Is Linux?</h1></div></div></div><p>Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The OS takes a well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many operating systems that exist today, or did in the past. Windows, DOS, OS/2, and Mac OS are all such operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different from these other operating systems, in terms of both its capabilities and its heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wanna-be out to make money. The Linux core, referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel</em></span>, was created by computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a member of Finland's Swedish ethnic minority, who wanted to create a Unix-like system that would work on home computers—particularly his.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world, so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it better and more powerful. It is this combination of applications built around the core of the Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions today.</p><p>Linux has acquired many fans and followers since its creation in 1991. Such devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen, command line–driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.</p><p>Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is used as a server), you don't have to do that. It is fair to say that with the advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI, pronounced "goo-ee"), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.</p><p>Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go graphical. The community at large developed various GUIs (called <span class="emphasis"><em>window managers</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>desktop environments</em></span>) and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>X Window System</em></span>) to bring about the change. The graphical desktop environment that is included in your Ubuntu distribution—GNOME—is one example of the fruit of that development.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0010" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="About the Penguin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="about_the_penguin"/>About the Penguin</h1></div></div></div><p>You may have been wondering about the penguin in the chapter title, so I might as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux mascot, and what has come to be thought of as <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> Linux penguin was designed by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot" title="Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot">Figure 1-1</a>). This explains not only the ornithological references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include <span class="emphasis"><em>penguin</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Tux</em></span>, such as TuxRacer, XPenguins, and Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>Penguinistas</em></span>. True, Ubuntu doesn't play up the penguin as much as other distributions, but Linux is Linux, and so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too . . . just a bit less conspicuously.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="tux_comma_the_linux_mascot"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e764"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656094.png.jpg" alt="Tux, the Linux mascot"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Why Should You Use Linux?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_should_you_use_linux_question"/>Why Should You Use Linux?</h1></div></div></div><p>People use Linux for different reasons. For many, it is a matter of power, stability, multilingual capabilities, or even personal philosophy. However, for others, crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money. Just think for a moment about what it usually costs to get started with an operating system. Go to wherever it is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make a list in your head of all the things you want to buy and how much each costs: an office suite; a game or two; maybe a graphics program with which to make yourself look better in your digital photos; and a collection of all those firewall, antispam, antivirus, and anti-adware programs that you really need to protect yourself in the Windows world. Now do the math.</p><p>After you pick yourself up off the floor, you will understand that we are talking big bucks here. On the other hand, for the price of this book, you will have all of the things you wanted and more in the Linux world. Despite the worries that many people have, making the move to Linux means not only savings for you but also more computing versatility. You will not be hamstrung at some point along the way because you don't have this or that program when you need it most—you'll have it all from the get-go or else be able to download it easily . . . and at no cost!</p><p>You might counter with the fact that there are a lot of freeware applications out there for other operating systems, but c'mon, let's face it—these are often rather limited in terms of their capabilities. The programs with a little more oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these days are limited in some way, or they let you use them only for a short time unless you are willing to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, but $25 here and $35 there eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of change. There is also the problem that some of these programs, unbeknownst to you, install backdoors or keyloggers or make your system a sudden garden of adware. Finally, at least in my experience, the majority of such programs are hardly worth the money asked.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Is It All Just About Money?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="is_it_all_just_about_money_question"/>Is It All Just About Money?</h2></div></div></div><p>Although money is important to the average user, it is certainly not the only reason for taking the Linux plunge; there are a variety of other reasons as well. As I mentioned, Linux is noted for its stability. Try running your current system for a month without restarting and see what happens. Linux has been known to run without a reboot for more than a year without a hitch or decrease in performance. With its multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a perfect choice for language students or users in a multilingual environment.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0023" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In addition, Linux is infinitely customizable: You can get your system to look and act the way you want it to without being "wizarded" to death. And then there are the applications that come with most Linux distributions. In addition to their wide variety, most are well up to industry snuff, with some, such as Evolution, the GIMP, and Inkscape, being sources of envy for those outside the Linux world.</p><p>Finally, with the advent of Microsoft's Windows 7 system and its more demanding hardware requirements (especially if you want to take advantage of its most touted new features), you may find your current machine on the fast track to obsolescence. Turning it into a Linux machine will ensure it several more years of working life. After all, it's a shame to put good hardware out to pasture so early.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="But Is Linux Really Ready for the Desktop?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="but_is_linux_really_ready_for_the_deskto"/>But Is Linux Really Ready for the Desktop?</h1></div></div></div><p>Despite the advances Linux has made in recent years, this question still pops up quite often, and that's fair enough. But consider this: When you install a program on your current Windows system and get an error message saying that the program can't run because some DLL file is missing, or when you connect a piece of hardware and can't get it to run, no one asks if that operating system is ready for the desktop.</p><p>In my own experience, I have found no reason to doubt that Linux is ready. Sure, Linux has its occasional quirks, but so does every other operating system. Linux is ready and able. If my mother, hardly a computer wiz, can do the work she needs to do and can keep herself amused until the middle of the night using her Linux system (without blowing the whole thing up), then I think it's pretty safe to say that you'll do all right too.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="What Is a Distribution?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_a_distribution_question"/>What Is a Distribution?</h1></div></div></div><p>An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and distribute the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user groups, and even private individuals. These entities create Linux system and application collections called <span class="emphasis"><em>distributions</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>distros</em></span>. You could bypass such distros and try to collect everything you'd need to set up a system all on your own, but you would undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt for the distros.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0026" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Most of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, basically consist of the same main elements: the core operating system (that's the Linux kernel I mentioned earlier); some sort of installer program to get all the system parts and applications properly installed on your machine; the X Window System to provide graphical interface support; one or more graphical desktop environments; and a series of applications, such as word processors, audio players, and games; as well as all the files needed to make these things work.</p><p>There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared toward specific audiences, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, programmers, system administrators, and specific language users. What makes each distro different is the software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other convenience features such as the package (or application) installation mechanism and the installer for the system itself. Some distros are especially appropriate for home users because of their ease of installation. Ubuntu, a relative newcomer to the Linux world, is one of these, joining other distros that have long been popular in the ease-of-use arena, such as Mandriva, SUSE, and Fedora Core. Although some of these entities charge for their distros, most also provide them free for download.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="What Is Ubuntu?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_ubuntu_question"/>What Is Ubuntu?</h1></div></div></div><p>Ubuntu is a completely free, easy-to-use, and extremely popular Linux distribution that is geared toward the desktop user. It is one of the hottest Linux distros in the marketplace today. It is also one of the few Linux distros with what could be described as a social agenda behind it.</p><p>Ubuntu was the brainchild of South African millionaire entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth, who is probably better known for being one of the first space tourists—the first African in space, to be exact. Shuttleworth invested more than $10 million in starting the Ubuntu Foundation based on his belief in free software and in order to fix what he describes as "bug #1"—Microsoft's dominance of the desktop PC marketplace (<a class="ulink" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1</a>).</p><p>As Shuttleworth states the following in his blog (available at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I believe that free software brings us into a new era of technology, and holds the promise of universal access to the tools of the digital era. I drive Ubuntu because I would like to see that promise delivered as reality.</p></blockquote></div><p>As you can see, it's a vision thing.</p><p>Befitting the nationality and goals of the man who brought it into being, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>ubuntu</em></span> comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu, according to Wikipedia, is a concept meaning something along the lines of "humanity toward others" or "I am because we are." If you're interested, the 2005 film <span class="emphasis"><em>In My Country</em></span>, although not one of the greatest films ever produced, is on many levels a 100-minute examination of the concept of ubuntu.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Why Ubuntu Then?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_ubuntu_then_question"/>Why Ubuntu Then?</h1></div></div></div><p>With so many distros out there, you may wonder why you should opt for Ubuntu. Well, as they say, numbers don't lie, and Ubuntu's popularity is not without good cause. These traits are especially crowd pleasing:<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0032" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Easy to install</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>It's fair to say that most Linux distributions these days are pretty easy to install (and definitely easier and faster to install than Windows). Ubuntu is right in line with these improvements, and the fact that you can install it with only a few mouse clicks while running the live CD means it is pretty much ready to go whenever you are.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Easy to use</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Ubuntu is easy to use in that it is very Windows-like in operation, and yet it's more Linux-like than other Windows user–oriented distributions. It is designed with the needs of real people in mind, not just compu-nerds and geeks.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>DEB based</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Ubuntu is based on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Debian</em></span> distribution, which means that it utilizes Debian's very convenient DEB package system for application handling and installation. The two preconfigured, graphical package installers that come with Ubuntu make installing applications even easier. So many packages are available for Debian systems like Ubuntu that you are likely to find more software out there than you'll ever know what to do with.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Up-to-date</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Some distros are updated at a snail's pace, while others strive to be so cutting edge that they are often plagued with bugs. Ubuntu, with its reasonable six-month release cycle, tries to stay as up-to-date as possible, while at the same time making sure that things are not released before they are ready for prime time. In this way, you are ensured of having an up-to-date yet less buggy distro at your disposal.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Dependable and robust</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>I know these terms come across as mere hype, but after you smack Ubuntu around a bit, you come to understand what they mean. Knock things down and around, and they bounce right back—this is very important for beginners who often have a knack for screwing things up. Nothing turns a new user off more than a twitchy system that has to be velvet-gloved all the time.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Desktop user–oriented</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>A lot of Linux distributions, although quite capable in the desktop arena, cater more to geeks and developers, taking up valuable disk space with a lot of junk you'll probably never use. Ubuntu's purpose is to grab desktop market share from the Redmond folks, so the needs of the common end user are always in mind. The result is that Ubuntu's GNOME desktop environment is a very comfy place for the average desktop user to be.</p></dd></dl></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Hardware Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hardware_compatibility"/>Hardware Compatibility</h1></div></div></div><p>Well, enough of this background babble; it's time to get things rolling. If you haven't installed Linux on your machine yet and are wondering whether you can, rest assured: Ubuntu will run on most machines out there today. Of course, you just never know until you get up and running. There are so many minor parts to your machine that it is difficult to say whether each part will cooperate with your installation. There are video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, and so on, and they all need to be considered.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0033" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Diving In"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="diving_in"/>Diving In</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are going to buy a new machine on which to run Ubuntu, then it is reasonable enough to do a bit of worrying and check things out first, but if you are going to install it on the machine you have, I recommend just diving in. After all, you don't really have to install anything the first time out. You have a live CD right here in this book, after all, so you can just pop that CD in your drive, boot up your machine, and, <span class="emphasis"><em>biff</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>bam</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>zowie</em></span>, you'll be up and running (or not) in a minute or two. If everything seems to be going as it should . . . well, your worries are over, and you can go ahead and install the system when you're ready and willing. That is one of the Ubuntu advantages—not only do all the essentials fit on a single CD (compared to four or more for other distros), but that CD is both a live operating environment and the installer! You can't get much more convenient than that.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0035" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="When Research Is Required"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="when_research_is_required"/>When Research Is Required</h2></div></div></div><p>If things don't work out for you with the live CD, you can start by taking a look at <a class="xref" href="ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. WOUNDED WINGS">Chapter 21</a>. If you don't find the answer to your problem there, search the Web to see whether you can identify what part of your hardware puzzle is causing your problems. (Or if you are looking to buy a machine on which to install Ubuntu, you can search for hardware that is supported by Linux.) Of course, before you can do this, you need to know what models of hardware you have. You should know at least what motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, and video card you have if you want to be able to find out anything of value. Identifying your CPU and monitor should be easy enough, but the motherboard and video card may require a bit more searching.</p><p>If you have no documentation that clearly states the make and model of these devices, you can find out most things you need to know from within Windows by going to the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span>, and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Hardware</strong></span> tab in that window. Once on the Hardware tab, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Device Manager</strong></span> button, and see what you can find about your system components. Sometimes the information there is rather limited, so you might instead want to try a shareware application such as HWiNFO (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hwinfo.com/">http://www.hwinfo.com/</a>) or Sandra (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sisoftware.net/">http://www.sisoftware.net/</a>) to get more useful details, such as the specifications of your motherboard or the supported video modes for your current setup.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0038" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Both HWiNFO and Sandra should give you the information you need about your motherboard, but if they don't (or if you don't feel like bothering with them), you can always just open the case of your computer and look at your board, though I wouldn't recommend doing so if you have a laptop. Once inside, you needn't worry about damaging anything because you don't need to touch anything—so don't. You may need a flashlight to find it, but the model name and number should be stamped on there somewhere, either in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example, says quite clearly in the middle of the board "AOpen MX46-533V." You should be looking for similar information.</p><p>Once you have all your information, you can do a variety of things to check out your hardware's compatibility with Ubuntu. You can simply do a Yahoo! or Google search by entering your motherboard's make and model plus the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span>. This works for other hardware devices too.</p><p>You can also post a question to the Ubuntu User Forums (at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) or one of the other various Linux forums or mailing lists on the Web. <a class="xref" href="ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. A COLONY OF PENGUINS">Chapter 20</a> might provide you with additional sources of information, and <a class="xref" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. RESOURCES">Appendix D</a> lists still other sources. When posting a forum question, just write that you are a newbie and want to know whether anyone has had any experience using Ubuntu with the board (or other hardware) in question. You will probably get quite a few responses. Linux users are usually rather evangelical in terms of trying to draw in new Penguinistas.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Hardware Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hardware_requirements"/>Hardware Requirements</h1></div></div></div><p>All worries about compatibility aside, you will need to meet some minimum hardware requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Any computer with a 1 GHz or higher i386-based processor, or an Intel or AMD 64-bit processor</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>About 5 gigabytes (GB) of hard disk space, though having at least 10GB would be a bit more comfy</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sufficient memory (RAM)</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The CD that comes with this book is designed to work on machines with i386-based processors (basically, all the Pentium chips, including Celeron, Xeon, and the new Core Duo, as well as processors from AMD). Though this CD will install Ubuntu on a computer with an AMD or Intel 64-bit processor, it will run in 32-bit mode only. To make full use of your 64-bit processor, you need to download the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Additional information is provided in <a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. UBUNTU DESKTOP CDS FOR AMD64, OPTERON, OR INTEL CORE 2 USERS">Appendix B</a>.</p></div><p>As for random access memory (RAM), the official specs tell you that you need a minimum of 512 megabytes (MB) to run Ubuntu. Although you can no doubt get by with this, you'd get by much better with more. My basic rule of thumb, no matter what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recommended (not the minimum) memory plus at least 128MB. Regardless of what the official specs say, put in more. You won't regret it.</p><p>Saying "the more memory you have, the better" may sound a bit simple, and perhaps even cavalier, but trust me on this one. When you have too little memory, no matter what system you are running, weird things happen: Applications seem to take years to open or don't open at all, menus take forever to render their little icons, and freezes and general system meltdowns just happen much more often. In other words, running your machine on too little RAM is sort of like trying to do jumping jacks in a broom closet. Sure, you could do it, but you would be all contorted, and you'd be smashing your hands into the walls every 1.4 seconds.</p><p>Fortunately, it is pretty hard to find a machine with less than 512MB of RAM these days (256MB, perhaps, on the really old beasties), but if you do happen to have such a machine, you can at least take solace in the fact that memory is relatively cheap, so go for it.</p></div>

Unfortunately, as of the Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn release, this is no longer the case. This means that if you are a PowerPC Mac user, you will have to use one of the older Ubuntu releases or use an unofficial, community-supported release of Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx (more on that name in the following section) for PowerPCs (<a class="ulink" href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0049" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, if you are using an Intel-based Mac, you're in luck: The disc that comes with this book will work on your Mac. After all, the <span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> in <span class="emphasis"><em>i386</em></span> stands for "Intel."</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Speaking Ubuntu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="speaking_ubuntu"/>Speaking Ubuntu</h1></div></div></div><p>It's worth noting that you are bound to come across a lot of weird phrases when dealing with Ubuntu, especially when searching for information on the Net. In particular, I am referring to seemingly incongruous phrases, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Warty Warthog</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hoary Hedgehog</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Breezy Badger</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dapper Drake</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Edgy Eft</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Feisty Fawn</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gutsy Gibbon</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardy Heron</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Intrepid Ibex</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Jaunty Jackalope</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Karmic Koala</em></span>. These are the unlikely code names of each of the releases of Ubuntu since its first appearance in 2004. The important one for you to remember is that of the current release, which is the one on the book's disc: version 10.04, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Lucid Lynx</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0056" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0066" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0068" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0069" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You are also likely to come across a few other variations of the Ubuntu theme. These are Kubuntu, a KDE-based version of Ubuntu; Edubuntu, a special version of Ubuntu designed for use in the classroom; Xubuntu, a lightweight version of Ubuntu based on the XFCE desktop; and Ubuntu Studio, a new flavor of Ubuntu, aimed at "creative people," which contains a strong suite of graphics, video, and music applications. There's even a slimmed-down version of Ubuntu, called Ubuntu Netbook Edition, designed specifically for netbooks.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0070" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0071" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0072" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0073" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0074" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

If you have already installed Ubuntu on your machine, just flip ahead to <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A NEW PLACE TO CALL HOME">Chapter 3</a>. If your machine is still Linuxless, though, it's time to take it out for a spin and see whether you like it. So for now, strap yourself down in front of that computer, clip on your spurs, and go straight to the next chapter. It's time to become a Penguinista!</p></div></body></html>
