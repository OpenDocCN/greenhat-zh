- en: One of the handiest things about Ubuntu is that it is equipped with a very simple-to-use
    application installation mechanism. The engine behind this is called Advanced
    Package Tool (APT), which allows you to easily download, install, update, and
    remove software packaged in DEB archives, or *packages*.
  id: totrans-3
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APT is a rather foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go missing,
    since it automatically downloads and installs any files that the main application
    you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called *dependencies*,
    proves to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The painful quest of
    finding and then installing this file or that, as well as any dependencies that
    those files themselves might have, has led to the missing dependency problem being
    referred to as *dependency hell*. APT makes that pretty much a thing of the past.
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, where does APT find all these files and applications? Well, the packages
    that APT searches for, downloads, and installs are located in a set of specific
    online repositories. These *repositories* are online servers in which a great
    number of applications, support files, and more are stored for use with your particular
    system. All of the files that originally came bundled with your system, including
    the system (kernel) itself and updates, when available, are stored there too.
    This is quite unlike Windows or Mac OS, where you normally need to buy a CD or
    download an installer file from a website to get new software.

- en: The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might consider
    a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means you control it
    via commands in a command Terminal. Fortunately, Ubuntu has a number of different
    graphical frontends for APT that allow you to bypass the command line and make
    everything about as easy as you could ever hope it would be. In this chapter,
    you will be focusing on three of these frontends.

    Being the most graphically satisfying of the frontends, it is especially useful
    when it comes to browsing for cool or handy applications. To get a feel for it,
    go to the **Applications** menu and select **Ubuntu Software Center**. The window
    that opens will look similar to [Figure 6-1](ch06.html#the_ubuntu_software_center

    not much more difficult to reach. Various individuals and companies compile small
    numbers of packages that are not available in Ubuntu into their own *third-party
    repositories*. These are typically free to access, if you can find them. All you

    `lucid-getdeb apps`. This follows the same format as all APT lines: the word `deb`,
    followed by a web address, followed by a couple of other words that specify which

    PPA** link, if you're curious.)

- en: This is just an example—PPAs aren't only used by enthusiasts to distribute nostalgic
    games. Some Ubuntu developers use PPAs to make the latest versions of software
    available, albeit in an unofficial and untested manner. If a major new version
    of OpenOffice.org or Firefox comes out, for example, keep your ear to the Ubuntu
    forums ([http://www.ubuntuforums.org/](http://www.ubuntuforums.org/)) to see whether
    someone has made the latest and greatest available through their PPA.

- en: As you may recall, the applications you install from the various repositories
    via the Ubuntu Software Center are in the form of DEB packages. And although it
    might seem that these repositories contain just about every piece of software
    possible, certain packages, for one reason or another, will never find their way
    into a repository. Skype is one of these packages.

- en: Skype, shown in [Figure 6-11](ch06s05.html#skype "Figure 6-11. Skype"), is Voice
    over IP (VoIP) software that allows you to speak to other Skype users over the
    Internet, with the clarity of a regular telephone line. And the best part is,
    it doesn't cost anything—even if you call users overseas. Skype also offers paid
    services, such as SkypeOut, which allows you to call regular mobile and landline
    telephone numbers from your computer at a fraction of what it would normally cost
    from a regular telephone.

- en: Although it is true that open source VoIP packages such as Ekiga Softphone are
    available in Ubuntu, they are not compatible with the much better known and more
    widespread Skype. Since it is very likely that the majority of people you know
    who are using a VoIP software package are using Skype, it only makes sense to
    use Skype so that you can easily communicate with them.

    get it yourself from the Skype website ([http://www.skype.com/](http://www.skype.com/)).
    Once there, click the **Download** button, which will automatically take you to
    the download page for Linux versions of Skype. On that page, click the link for
    Ubuntu, and then click the **Save File** button in the window that appears.

    disk, probably in your *Downloads* folder. Double-click that package to open the
    Package Installer window ([Figure 6-12](ch06s05.html#the_package_installer_window
    "Figure 6-12. The Package Installer window")). Click **Install Package**, after
    which you will be prompted for your password. Once the installation is complete,
    click the **Close** button in the window that appears and again in the Package
    Installer window.

    ▸ **Internet** ▸ **Skype**. If you find that you can't make calls or the sound
    doesn't work properly, take a look at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype/)
    for troubleshooting hints. Also, while we're on the topic of sound, remember that
    it is best to use Skype with a headset. Trying to talk with a stick microphone
    could cause feedback or echoes, because the microphone will pick up and transmit
    sounds from the speakers.
