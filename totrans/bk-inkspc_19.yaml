- en: Even in this supposedly “electronic” age, business cards (or visiting cards,
    or address cards—if you don’t want to sound too business-like) remain popular.
    This little piece of cardboard is a reflection of your—or your organization’s—personality,
    a little presentation of what you consider most important about you. So, not surprisingly,
    the design aspect of this small item of stationery is very important. Like in
    a three-line haiku, you have a very limited space to make a clear, original, and
    memorable statement.

    to stand out—a business card is a perfect test project for such an essential designer’s
    tool as a vector editor. Inkscape’s toolset makes it a great tool for the job;
    its only real weakness is the relative difficulty of creating print-ready output
    files with device colors.

- en: The steps of this tutorial show two quite different sample designs, but I’m
    not inviting you to follow them exactly (unless you just want to learn the techniques).
    If you plan to design a real business card, try to find and analyze a lot more
    examples than these two, and play with Inkscape to come up with something that
    combines the best features you’ve seen with something completely original. Creativity
    cannot be taught, but it can be inspired. My examples are both somewhat on the
    artsy side; perhaps what you have in mind for your own card would be more traditional—but
    the general approach would be the same.

    called **business_card_90x50mm** from the **File** ▸ **New** submenu. (If you
    need a different size, you can always change it in **Document Properties**, ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735646.png.jpg).)
    Then switch to the Text tool and create text objects for all the text lines you
    will display on your card—name, position, address, phone, etc. Make them all independent
    objects (click and type each one separately) because you’re going to move them
    around a lot, trying different layouts. If you will display a logo on your card,
    import the logo file ([Appendix B](apb.html "Appendix B. Import and Export"))
    and, if you only have it in bitmap format, trace it (**[18.8 Tracing](ch18s08.html
    "18.8 Tracing")**) to convert it to paths.

    go a long way towards a design you like, too. If you’re serious about design,
    you likely have a large library of your favorite fonts; otherwise, a few basic
    (but good) fonts usually come with your operating system. Many high-quality and
    free (or inexpensive) fonts can be found on the Web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have long liked the free font called Gentium;^([[7](#ftn.ch19fn01)]) its main
    feature is good Unicode support, but I also find it aesthetically pleasing, so
    I decided to use it for this design. After you assign the font to all the text
    strings, play with their relative sizes by resizing them in Selector ([Figure 19-2](ch19s01.html#fonts_and_sizes
    "Figure 19-2. Fonts and sizes")). Do the different sizes of the same font look
    good together? Strangely, that is not a given—and if not, you will need to use
    different fonts for different elements. In any case, however, never use more than
    two fonts in such a small design—it will likely look too motley.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make Inkscape see a new font, just install it as you usually do in your operating
    system and restart Inkscape. The new font will be listed in the **Text and Font**
    dialog as well as in the Text tool’s drop-down list (**[15.4.2 Fonts and Variants](ch15s04.html#one5dot4dot2_fonts_and_variants
    "15.4.2 Fonts and Variants")**). Supported font formats include TrueType, Type
    1, and OpenType.

    to be used by many cards with different names) has an important advantage: You
    can position and align your text objects precisely, without having to leave extra
    space for variable-length names and addresses. In this case, I was able to push
    all the address bits closely against the name, creating an asymmetric composition
    tightly bound together by its alignments (the address is aligned with the start
    of the last name, the email with the top of the name, etc.).'

    and rotate a bit (press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735390.png.jpg)

    but influentional movement of the 1920s whose proponents loved bold contrasts
    and running texts at an angle (though they probably would not have approved of
    the Gentium font). Let’s develop this style; add three black corners intruding
    into the composition from the edges and place a big red circle in the mass center
    of the composition, as shown in [Figure 19-4](ch19s02.html#rotating_and_adding_shapes

    letter pairs). In the Text tool, use ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736208.png.jpg),

    spacing, while small type needs increased letter spacing for readability.

    clipart, for example from *http://openclipart.org* (**[1.3 Sources of Inkscape

    I switched to the Calligraphic pen, set the **Angle** to 90 degrees with a **Fixation**

    more or less right, the result was mildly interesting but far from exciting. I
    then tried to improve it by creating a union of the path objects and then simplifying,
    insetting, and outsetting it a few times:'

    a somewhat narrower pen nib, maximized **Tremor** to 100 and danced wildly around

    looks too empty, too flat, too hostile to the irregular blotch of ink in its center.
    Can we do something about it? Let’s try adding some background gradients. As explained
    in **[10.7 Gradient Tips and Examples](ch10s07.html "10.7 Gradient Tips and Examples")**,
    the default gradient from opacity 1 to opacity 0 of some color (for example, blue)
    looks crude and unnatural, its boundary clearly visible even if it uses a very
    pale color. To improve the look of a gradient over a white background, paint the
    transparent end of the gradient white, instead of the same color as the other
    end.

    at the edges of the card to achieve a naturally curly, softly blended, asymmetric
    look. The dashed lines are the bounding boxes of the four rectangles with gradients,
    and the gradient lines show the span and direction of each gradient. I painted
    the initials dark blue and added a blurred, 50% opaque drop shadow to the letters
    (**Filters** ▸ **Shadows and Glows** ▸ **Drop Shadow**).

    open **Fill and Stroke** (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735322.png.jpg)),
    switch the fill to pattern, and choose the **Stripes 1:1 white** stock pattern.
    Now, using pattern adjustment handles in the Node tool (**[10.8.1 Creating Patterns](ch10s08.html#one0dot8dot1_creating_patterns
    "10.8.1 Creating Patterns")**), rotate the strips and scale them down according
    to taste. Finally, move the rectangle over the gradients and the initials but
    below the text in z-order, and reduce its opacity to 20%.

    powerful format by itself and it is better supported by Inkscape; with it, you
    don’t have to worry about gradients or opacity. Filtered objects—such as the initials

    to PDF if you enable this option in the PDF export options dialog.

    the necessarily vector elements from those that can be rendered into a bitmap.
    For example, text (especially using small-size fonts), logos, and crisp foreground
    shapes must remain vector; avoid using filters on them, but separate them into
    a foreground layer and convert all texts to paths so they do not depend on the
    availability of the fonts. Anything else (background shapes with or without transparency,
    filtered objects, imported bitmaps, etc.) can be collectively pre-rendered into
    a single bitmap with **Make a Bitmap Copy**: Set the desired resolution in **Inkscape
    Preferences** (**Bitmaps** page), select all the objects to rasterize, and press
    ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736400.png.jpg), after which you can
    delete or hide the vector originals. Thus, an “export-hardened” file—with best
    chances of being exported to PDF, imported into other programs, or printed without
    loss—would typically have just two layers: one with bitmap-like artwork rendered
    as one large bitmap and the other with vector-like artwork all in paths.'

    PDF or TIFF that faithfully reproduces the way your design looks on screen. Instead,
    you need your output to use device-specific CMYK or spot colors. While there’s
    some limited support for using color-managed display, you can’t export anything
    except the sRGB screen color space into any output format. Until this area is
    improved, you will need to use some other software to rectify this.

    using only open source tools; first, convert the PNG exported from Inkscape to
    regular RGB TIFF, and then use the tifficc command-line utility from the LittleCMS
    library^([[9](#ftn.ch19fn03)]) to convert it to CMYK. You will need the ICC profile
