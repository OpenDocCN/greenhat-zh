- en: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) provides network clients with an
    automated method of obtaining the configuration parameters necessary to communicate
    with other systems in an IP (Internet Protocol) based network. The parameters
    a DHCP server commonly provides to clients include IP address assignments, DNS
    server addresses, and default routers or gateway addresses.

- en: When a client system first joins a network using DHCP, it broadcasts a request
    to the local network for configuration information. The DHCP server then answers
    this request with the parameters set in the DHCP server configuration file. The
    client system applies this assigned configuration to its network interface in
    order to communicate with the network.

- en: 'DHCP servers generally assign IP addresses in one of two ways: statically or
    dynamically. The static method allocates an IP address to a client based on the
    client''s hardware MAC (Media Access Control) address. This IP address will not
    change. A dynamic IP address assignment is a leased address. The DHCP server assigns
    these addresses from a pool or range set by the administrator. Dynamic IP addresses
    are returned to the pool when a client disconnects from the network. If the same
    client rejoins the network, it may be assigned a different IP address if the previously
    assigned address is unavailable.'

    Version 1 of ISC's DHCP server was released by Ted Lemon in December 1997\. ISC's
    DHCP implementation remains one of the most popular and robust open source DHCP
    solutions.
