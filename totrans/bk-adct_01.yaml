    low-end sound cards do not have drivers that support volume control. It may not
    control volume levels on USB devices either, again depending on what their drivers
    support. If this is the case, in Windows go to the Sound module in the Control
    Panel to control volume levels. Linux users should use alsamixer. (Remember, [Chapter 13](ch13.html

    small and stay lit after your recording levels drop, which limits their usefulness.

- en: In digital audio it is common practice to record to a low peak level, as low
    as -24 dB. The digital audio decibel scale is measured in negative numbers up
    to zero. About the smallest change we can perceive is 1 dB, and -60 dB is as good
    as silence for most people, so a practical range to use is -60 to 0 dB. A +3 dB
    change doubles the volume, and +3 dB halves it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A super-low peak such as -24 dB is useful when you’re recording something with
    unpredictable levels, such as a live performance. For other, more controlled circumstances,
    a good peak level is between -12 dB and -6 dB. Any sound level over 0 dB will
    result in clipping, which creates distortion. Avoiding distortion is very important
    in digital audio recording. The signal-to-noise ratio is extremely high, so you
    don’t need to push your recording levels to the maximum just to keep noise at
    tolerable levels.

    Check “Remove any DC offset,” check “Normalize maximum amplitude to,” and set
    a maximum level up to zero. *DC offset* refers to the mean amplitude; if this
    is not zero, then normalization won’t be applied correctly because the amplitude
    levels will be unbalanced, and it might create some distortion.

- en: The difference between Amplify and Normalize is seen when they are applied to
    multiple tracks. Amplify changes the volume on all tracks by an equal amount.
    If you amplify volume by +9 dB, a track that peaks at -20 dB will be raised to
    -11 dB, and a track that peaks at -9 dB will be raised to 0 dB. Normalize, on
    the other hand, adjusts all tracks to the same maximum volume level, so some tracks
    may be changed more than others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default maximum setting for both is zero. It’s useful to lower this to -12
    dB or so on your studio masters in order to leave a bit of headroom for more tweaking
    without risking clipping. For example, when you downmix multiple tracks into a
    single track, the latter will have the combined amplitudes of all those tracks
    and get louder, maybe a lot louder. Experience will tell you how much headroom
    you need. Don’t normalize to zero until you are making your final exports.

    here is the oversimplified short story: Integers are whole numbers, and *float*
    means floating decimal point. This 32-bit float number is a 24-bit mantissa plus
    an 8-bit exponent. This is significant in terms of audio production—it gives you
    a dynamic range of about 1500 dB, which means virtually no noise or clipping,

    you should be able to hear the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit recordings,
