We’ll then get you up to snuff on what this Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and what you will need in order to do so. For those of you who already have joined the Linux world and have Ubuntu or another distribution installed on your machines, some of this may be old news, but a few bits of information may still be of interest to you. For those others who may be curious but are still unsure whether or not to take the plunge, or those of you who have no idea what Linux even is and have picked up this book to find out, this chapter will prove especially useful.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0001"/></p><p>You will probably have lots of questions as you make your way through the book, and, like most people, you may also have a few doubts or worries. Hopefully by the time you finish, you will have your Linux system up and running; any doubts or worries you might have had will have been dispelled; and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. If you are reluctant to make a commitment by installing Ubuntu on your hard disk, remember that you can still follow along because the disc that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu installer, a live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience without having to even touch your hard drive.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0005"/></p><div class="sect1" title="What Is Linux?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_linux_question"/>What Is Linux?</h1></div></div></div><p>Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The OS takes a well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do.</p><p>You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many operating systems that exist today, or did in the past. Windows and Mac OS are such operating systems, as is Unix, the commercial-grade operating system behind many Internet sites and databases. And don’t think that computers are the only place you run into operating systems. Those of you with smartphones, which are themselves miniature computers, are probably interacting daily with the Android operating system or iOS, the operating system on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>Linux is yet another operating system. It is, however, different from other operating systems in terms of both its capabilities and its heritage. <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span> was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wannabe out to make money. The Linux core, referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel</em></span>, was created by computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a member of Finland’s Swedish ethnic minority, who wanted to create a Unix-like system that would work on home computers—particularly his.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0007"/></p><p>Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world, so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it better and more powerful. It is this combination of applications built around the core of the Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions today.</p><p>Linux has acquired many fans and followers since its creation in 1991. Such devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen, command line-driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.</p><p>Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is used as a server), you don’t have to do that. It is fair to say that with the advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI, pronounced “goo-ee”), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0012"/></p><p>Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go graphical. The community at large developed various GUIs (called window managers and desktop environments) and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Window System</em></span>). The graphical desktop environment that is included in your Ubuntu distribution—Unity—is one example of the fruit of that development.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0013"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="About the Penguin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="about_the_penguin"/>About the Penguin</h1></div></div></div><p>You may have been wondering about the penguin in the chapter title, so I might as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux mascot, and what has come to be thought of as <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> Linux penguin was designed by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot" title="Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot">Figure 1-1</a>). This explains not only the ornithological references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include <span class="emphasis"><em>penguin</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Tux</em></span> in their names, such as TuxRacer, Tux Paint, and Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to as Penguinistas. True, Ubuntu doesn’t play up the penguin as much as other distributions, but Linux is Linux so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too . . . just a bit less conspicuously.</p><div class="figure"><a id="tux_comma_the_linux_mascot"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e630"/><img alt="Tux, the Linux mascot" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263418.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Should You Use Linux?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="should_you_use_linux_question"/>Should You Use Linux?</h1></div></div></div><p>The goal of this book is not to twist your arm and make you dump your current OS for Linux. If you are happy with what you’ve got, then stick with it. However, many people have switched to Linux for one reason or another. For many, crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money.</p><p>Unlike life in the Windows and Mac worlds, all the software you could conceivably want usually comes bundled in a Linux distribution, and there are still thousands of additional applications that you can add for free. And unlike the freeware and shareware applications in the Windows and Mac worlds, which eventually ask you for $25 here and $35 there, you will not be hit up for money when you least expect it. You will also not have to worry about the applications installing, unbeknownst to you, <span class="emphasis"><em>backdoors</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>keyloggers</em></span> or making your system a sudden garden of adware.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0016"/></p><p>Although money is important to the average user, it is certainly not the only reason Linux users make the switch. For some, it is a matter of personal philosophy—the belief that software should be freely accessible to all. Others like it because it gives them total control over almost everything, from how things behave to how they look; in other words, Linux lets them geek around. Others like it because of the stability Linux is noted for. Try running your current system for a month without restarting and see what happens. Linux has been known to run without a reboot for more than a year without a hitch or decrease in performance. With its multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a perfect choice for language students or users in a multilingual environment.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0017"/></p><p>Finally, with the advent of Microsoft’s Windows 7 system and its more demanding hardware requirements (especially if the user is trying to take advantage of its most touted new features), some find their current machines on the fast track to obsolescence. Turning it into a Linux machine will give it several more years of working life. After all, it’s a shame to put good hardware out to pasture so early.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Is a Distribution?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_a_distribution_question"/>What Is a Distribution?</h1></div></div></div><p>An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and distribute the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user groups, and even private individuals. These entities create Linux system and application collections called <span class="emphasis"><em>distributions</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>distros</em></span>. You could bypass such distros and try to collect everything you’d need to set up a system all on your own, but you would undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt for the distros.</p><p>Most of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, basically consist of the same main elements: the core operating system (that’s the Linux kernel I mentioned earlier); some sort of installer program to get all the system parts and applications properly installed on your machine; the X Window System to provide graphical interface support; one or more graphical desktop environments; and a series of applications, such as word processors, audio players, and games; as well as all the files needed to make these things work.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0018"/></p><p>There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared toward specific audiences, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, programmers, system administrators, and specific language users. What makes each distro different is the software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other convenience features such as the package (or application) installation mechanism and the installer for the system itself. Some distros are especially appropriate for home users because of their ease of installation. Ubuntu, a relative newcomer to the Linux world, is one of these, joining other distros that have long been popular in the ease-of-use arena, such as openSUSE and Fedora.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Is Ubuntu?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_is_ubuntu_question"/>What Is Ubuntu?</h1></div></div></div><p>Ubuntu is a completely free, easy-to-use, and extremely popular Linux distribution that is geared toward the desktop user. It is one of the hottest Linux distros in the marketplace today. It is also one of the few Linux distros with what could be described as a social agenda behind it.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0022"/></p><p>Ubuntu was the brainchild of South African millionaire entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth, who is probably better known for being one of the first space tourists—the first African in space, to be exact. Shuttleworth invested more than $10 million in starting the Ubuntu Foundation based on his belief in free software and in order to fix what he describes as “bug #1”—Microsoft’s dominance of the desktop PC marketplace (<a class="ulink" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1/">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1/</a>).</p><p>As Shuttleworth states in his blog (available at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I believe that free software brings us into a new era of technology, and holds the promise of universal access to the tools of the digital era. I drive Ubuntu because I would like to see that promise delivered as reality.</p></blockquote></div><p>As you can see, it’s a vision thing.</p><p>Befitting the nationality and goals of the man who brought it into being, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>ubuntu</em></span> comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu</em></span>, according to Wikipedia, is a concept meaning something along the lines of “humanity toward others” or “I am because we are.” If you’re interested, the 2005 film <span class="emphasis"><em>In My Country</em></span>, although not one of the greatest films ever produced, is on many levels a 100-minute examination of the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>ubuntu</em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Why Ubuntu Then?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_ubuntu_then_question"/>Why Ubuntu Then?</h1></div></div></div><p>With so many distros out there, you may wonder why you should opt for Ubuntu. Well, as they say, numbers don’t lie, and Ubuntu’s popularity is not without good cause. Like most Linux distributions these days, Ubuntu is easy to install and quite robust and dependable in terms of everyday use. Unlike other distributions, however, Ubuntu is based on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Debian</em></span> distribution, which means that it utilizes Debian’s very convenient DEB package system for application handling and installation. The graphical package installer that comes with Ubuntu, Ubuntu Software Center, makes installing those applications even easier, and with so many applications available there, you are likely to find more software than you’ll ever know what to do with.</p><p>More importantly, Ubuntu is designed to be user friendly—it tries to enable average people to do what they do most often as easily as possible. It is designed with the needs of real people in mind, not just compu-nerds and geeks. As such, it is designed primarily as a desktop system, and perhaps for that reason, Ubuntu’s desktop environment, called Unity, is a very comfy place for the average desktop user.</p><p>Finally, while some distros are updated at a snail’s pace and others strive to be so cutting edge that they are often plagued with bugs, Ubuntu has a reasonable six-month release cycle. In this time frame, it tries to stay as up-to-date as possible, while at the same time making sure that things are not released before they are ready for prime time. In this way, you are ensured of having an up-to-date yet less buggy distro at your disposal.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0029"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Hardware Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hardware_compatibility"/>Hardware Compatibility</h1></div></div></div><p>If you haven’t installed Linux on your machine yet, you might be wondering whether or not Ubuntu will run on it. This used to be an important consideration when installing a Linux distribution, but these days it’s less of an issue for a number of reasons. Of course, there are so many minor parts to your machine that it is difficult to say whether each part will cooperate with your installation. There are video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, and so on, and they all need to be considered. Nevertheless, chances are good that Ubuntu will run on your machine. The even better news is you can test whether your setup will work by using the disc that comes with this book. If, after starting up your machine from the live disc, everything seems to be going as it should . . . well, your worries are over, and you can install the system whenever you’re ready and willing. That is a great and pretty much risk-free advantage.</p><div class="sect2" title="When Research Is Required"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="when_research_is_required"/>When Research Is Required</h2></div></div></div><p>If things don’t work out for you with the live CD, you will have to do a bit of investigating. You can start by taking a look at <a class="xref" href="ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Wounded Wings">Chapter 22</a>. If you don’t find the answer to your problem there, search the Web to see whether you can identify what part of your hardware puzzle is causing your problems. (Or if you are looking to buy a machine on which to install Ubuntu, you can search for hardware that is supported by Linux.) Of course, before you can do this, you need to know what models of hardware you have. You should know at least what motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, and video card you have if you want to be able to find out anything of value. Identifying your CPU and monitor should be easy enough, but the motherboard and video card may require a bit more searching.</p><p>If you have no documentation that clearly states the make and model of these devices, you can find out most things you need to know from within Windows by going to the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span>, and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Hardware</strong></span> tab in that window. Once on the Hardware tab, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Device Manager</strong></span> button and see what you can find out about your system components. Sometimes the information there is limited, so you might instead want to try a shareware application such as HWiNFO (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hwinfo.com/">http://www.hwinfo.com/</a>) or Sandra (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sisoftware.net/">http://www.sisoftware.net/</a>) to get more useful details, such as the specifications of your motherboard or the supported video modes for your current setup.</p><p>Both HWiNFO and Sandra should give you the information you need about your motherboard, but if they don’t (or if you don’t feel like bothering with them), you can always just open the case of your computer and look at your board. Note that I wouldn’t recommend doing this if you have a laptop. Once inside, you needn’t worry about damaging anything because you don’t need to touch anything—so don’t. You may need a flashlight to find it, but the model name and number should be stamped on there somewhere, either in the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example, says quite clearly in the middle of the board “AOpen MX46-533V.” You should be looking for similar information.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0033"/></p><p>Once you have all your information, you can do a variety of things to check out your hardware’s compatibility with Ubuntu. You can simply do a Yahoo! or Google search by entering your motherboard’s make and model plus the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span>. This works for other hardware devices too.</p><p>You can also post a question at the Ubuntu User Forums (at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) or one of the other various Linux forums or mailing lists on the Web. <a class="xref" href="ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. A Colony of Penguins">Chapter 21</a> might provide you with additional sources of information, and <a class="xref" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Resources">Appendix D</a> lists still other sources. When posting a forum question, just write that you are a newbie and want to know whether anyone has had any experience using Ubuntu with the board (or other hardware) in question. You will probably get quite a few responses. Linux users are usually rather evangelical in terms of trying to draw in new Penguinistas.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Hardware Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hardware_requirements"/>Hardware Requirements</h1></div></div></div><p>All worries about compatibility aside, you will need to meet some minimum hardware requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Any computer with a 1 GHz or higher i386-based processor or an Intel or AMD 64-bit processor</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>About 5 gigabytes (GB) of hard disk space, though having at least 10GB would be a bit more comfy</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sufficient memory (RAM)</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The CD that comes with this book is designed to work on machines with i386-based processors (basically, all the Pentium chips, including Celeron, Xeon, and the new Core Duo, as well as processors from AMD). Though this CD will install Ubuntu on a computer with an AMD or Intel 64-bit processor, it will run in 32-bit mode only. To make full use of your 64-bit processor, you need to download the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Additional information is provided in <a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Ubuntu Desktop 64-Bit Discs">Appendix B</a>.</p></div><p>As for random access memory (RAM), the official specs tell you that you need a minimum of 512MB to run Ubuntu. Although you can no doubt get by with this, you’d get by much better with more. My basic rule of thumb, no matter what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recommended (not the minimum) memory plus at least 256MB, preferably 512MB. Regardless of what the official specs say, put in more. You won’t regret it.</p><p>Saying “The more memory you have, the better,” may sound a bit simple, perhaps even cavalier, but trust me on this one. When you have too little memory, no matter what system you are running, weird things happen: Applications seem to take years to open or don’t open at all, menus take forever to render their little icons, and freezes and general system meltdowns just happen much more often. In other words, running your machine on too little RAM is sort of like trying to do jumping jacks in a broom closet. Sure, you could do it, but you would be all contorted, and you’d be smashing your hands into the walls every 1.4 seconds.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0035"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0037"/></p><p>Fortunately, it is pretty hard to find a machine with less than 512MB or less of RAM these days, but if you do happen to have such a machine, you can take solace in the fact that memory is relatively cheap, so go for it.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Good News for 64-Bit Machine Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="good_news_for_64-bit_machine_users"/>Good News for 64-Bit Machine Users</h1></div></div></div><p>It is again important to mention that the CD that comes with this book is designed to work on machines with i386-based processors, which pretty much covers the vast majority of PCs out there.
