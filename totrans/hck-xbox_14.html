  <h1><span class="chapter">Appendix A -</span><br/>
  Where to Get Your Hacking Gear</h1>

  <p class="calibre1">A significant psychological barrier to getting started in hardware hacking is the perceived unavailability of hacking tools. While Radio Shack stocks a <span style="font-size: 1em;">small supply of components and tools, the components are expensive and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">most of the tools are difficult to use with today’s miniaturized compon</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ents. This appendix lists a few of the component and tool vendors that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">have a solid selection at reasonable prices. This appendix also includes</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Jameco order numbers for the basic tools required to do the projects in this book. You can enter these order numbers directly into Jameco’s secure</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ordering website to help get you started quickly.</span></p>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_119"><b class="calibre3">Vendors for Hobbyists</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">There are a wide variety of component and equipment distributors, from <span style="font-size: 1em;">those that cater primarily to large businesses, to those that service individuals, hobbyists, and repairmen. You may experience some frustration when</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">dealing with a distributor that caters to large businesses. These distributors service high-volume accounts, so accounts are serviced by a designated sales representative. As a result, it may be difficult to get a comprehensive catalog of parts or pricing and inventory information for small orders. The vendors listed in this section are friendly to individual orders and the their collective inventory will stock most of the parts you will ever need.</span></p>

I have included the 1/</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">32” conical bevel tip in the order form above because the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">soldering iron comes with a horrendously large</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">1/8” chisel tip. A 1/8” tip is useful for soldering together small</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">countries and creating solder shorts all over your fine-pitched</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">components. Conical bevel and chisel tips feature a flattened</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">region that enables rapid heat transfer, and thus are easier to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">use than conical sharp tips. I have also included some solder</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ing iron tip cleaner and some rosin paste flux. They are a little</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">bit pricey, but they will make your life a lot easier, trust me.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre1">The table below lists a few tools that are nice to have <span style="font-size: 1em;">around, but pricey enough that you probably should only</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">get them if you anticipate doing a lot of hacking.</span></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The soldering iron stand and sponge are a must if you plan on doing even a moderate amount of soldering. The stand safely stows the hot soldering iron tip, reducing the chance of burns and fires.</li>

      <li>Try soldering with the 1/32” semi-chisel tip. You may find that you like it better than the conical bevel tip.</li>

      <li>The anti-stat wrist-strap is always a good idea to have on hand, especially if you tend to wear clothes and shoes that generate static electricity.</li>

      <li>The SMT removal kit comes in handy when trying to remove smaller SMT components.</li>

      <li>The multimeter is a great all-purpose test, measurement, and diagnostic tool to have on hand at all times, and has applications all around the house or dorm. Many models of multimeters are available; the one listed here offers the most features for the lowest price. I have tried it out and it works well.</li>

      <li>The wire stripper and crimping tool listed here are very helpful for the power supply replacement project. The crimping tool is sold by Digi-Key, not Jameco. The crimping tool is a bit on the pricey side, but unlike sub ten dollar tools it features shaped crimp dies for higher-quality solderless crimps.</li>
