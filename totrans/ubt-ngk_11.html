This is true of Linux as well. Just open your web browser and, without performing any special installations, you can read pages in any European language, including those with Cyrillic alphabets, such as Russian. You can even view pages in Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Arabic, and Hebrew, to name but a few.</p><p>But the multilingual capabilities of Linux are much greater than this, and the way that it handles multilingual matters makes it quite easy to take advantage of these capabilities. As you will soon see, you can even set up your system to give you a totally foreign language environment, allowing you to function completely in the language of your choice. Add to this the ever-expanding number of free programs available for language study, and you have a truly meaningful language-learning tool.</p><div class="sect1" title="Read-Only Language Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="read-only_language_support"/>Read-Only Language Support</h1></div></div></div><p>If all you want is to be able to read web pages or documents written in a foreign language, you don't need to install any additional language support except in some rare cases.

Sometimes, however, the author of the page may neglect to include the character coding for that page in the HTML, in which case Firefox, not knowing that the page is prepared in another language, will very often open it in the default language of your system. The result is a page in which you see nothing but odd combinations of symbols and letters that have no meaning. In this case, try changing the character coding in Firefox to the language encoding you believe the page to be in. Some languages employ more than one encoding scheme, so if you're not sure, give each one a try. You can make your choices by going to the Firefox <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> menu and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Character Encoding</strong></span>. From the submenu there, you can select the appropriate coding for the language of that page.</p></div></div>

<div class="sect1" title="Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Input"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="chinese_comma_japanese_comma_and_korean"/>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Input</h1></div></div></div><p>For most European languages (and many other alphabet-based non-European languages), pressing a letter on the keyboard simply prints that letter to the screen. However, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean require a kind of conversion process that is handled by a special application (actually a set of applications) called an <span class="emphasis"><em>input method editor (IME)</em></span>. Each of these languages has its own IME, and each is quite different because of the basic differences in the three writing systems.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1088" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1089" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1090" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1091" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1092" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Chinese"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="chinese"/>Chinese</h2></div></div></div><p>Although most people (at least those in the linguistic know) would think that Chinese would be the most complicated system, because the writing system consists of thousands of characters, it is in fact the simplest. The Chinese IME simply takes the Romanized keyboard input, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>pinyin</em></span>, and converts it into Chinese characters, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Hanzi</em></span>. For the IME, it is essentially a simple dictionary lookup task—big dictionary, simple IME. In the event that there is more than one character for the pinyin input, a list of possible candidates will appear, and the user can then simply select the appropriate character from that list. More recent Chinese IMEs also have predictive capabilities, by which they judge what you are trying to type on the basis of what you've typed so far (<a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#chinese_imes_can_predict_what_you_apostr" title="Figure 11-6. Chinese IMEs can predict what you're going to write . . . kind of.">Figure 11-6</a>). Although these more "intelligent" IMEs can be a bit squirrelly to use at first, they prove to be rather handy once you get the hang of things.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1093" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1094" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1095" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="chinese_imes_can_predict_what_you_apostr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject11_d1e16869"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656443.png.jpg" alt="Chinese IMEs can predict what you're going to write . . . kind of."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 11-6. Chinese IMEs can predict what you're going to write . . . kind of.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Japanese"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="japanese"/>Japanese</h2></div></div></div><p>The Japanese IME has a considerably more complicated task to perform, because it has three writing systems to deal with: <span class="emphasis"><em>Kanji</em></span> (ideographic characters borrowed long ago from China), <span class="emphasis"><em>hiragana</em></span> (the phono-alphabetic system used mainly for tense and case endings), and <span class="emphasis"><em>katakana</em></span> (used mainly for words borrowed from other languages). Still, the standard input method for Japanese is primarily via the standard Roman keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-function keys. Thus, typing in Japanese is a two-step process whereby the IME first converts the romanized text into hiragana as it is typed and then converts it to appropriate Kanji, katakana, or hiragana elements after the spacebar is pressed.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1096" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1097" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1098" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can see an example of these steps in <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#ime_conversions_while_typing_in_japanese" title="Figure 11-7. IME conversions while typing in Japanese">Figure 11-7</a>. In the first line, the IME has already converted the Romanized input on the fly. It has converted <span class="emphasis"><em>rinakkusdenihongonyuuryokugamodekimasu</em></span> (which means <span class="emphasis"><em>You can input Japanese in Linux</em></span>) to hiragana. When a line of hiragana is highlighted, it means that the line has not yet been converted beyond that. In the second line, however, the user has subsequently pressed the spacebar, which caused the IME to convert the hiragana string into the appropriate Kanji, hiragana, and katakana elements. The first word, <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span>, has been converted to katakana text, because it is a borrowed word, while <span class="emphasis"><em>Japanese input</em></span> has been converted to Kanji; the rest stays in hiragana.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ime_conversions_while_typing_in_japanese"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject11_d1e16916"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656445.png.jpg" alt="IME conversions while typing in Japanese"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 11-7. IME conversions while typing in Japanese</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Korean"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="korean"/>Korean</h2></div></div></div><p>The job of the Korean IME is again quite different from that of the Chinese and Japanese IMEs, because the language is written in a very different way. Korean is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Hangul</em></span>, or in a combination of Hangul and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese called <span class="emphasis"><em>Hanja</em></span>. While the Hanja characters are essentially the same as their Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Hanzi and Kanji, the Korean phonetic alphabet, Hangul, has it own unique appearance, as you can see in the Korean word for Korea, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hangug(k)</em></span>, in <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#korea_open_parenthesis_hangug_close_pare" title="Figure 11-8. Korea (Hangug) written horizontally in Hangul">Figure 11-8</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1099" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1100" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="korea_open_parenthesis_hangug_close_pare"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject11_d1e16948"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656447.png.jpg" alt="Korea (Hangug) written horizontally in Hangul"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 11-8. <span class="emphasis"><em>Korea (Hangug)</em></span> written horizontally in Hangul</p></div><p>This seems simple; however, the representation is not quite correct, because Korean is very unique in the way that its alphabetic characters are put to the page. Unlike the usual side-by-side positioning of hiragana, katakana, and most other languages written with an alphabet, Hangul letters are grouped in pairs, triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a general rule, clockwise. The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually based on a Korean alphabetical keyboard layout) while it is being typed, and it must adjust the size, spacing, and positioning of each of the letters as it puts them into appropriate clusters (see <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html#an_example_of_the_clustering_process_in" title="Figure 11-9. An example of the clustering process in the Korean IME">Figure 11-9</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="an_example_of_the_clustering_process_in"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject11_d1e16960"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656449.png.jpg" alt="An example of the clustering process in the Korean IME"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 11-9. An example of the clustering process in the Korean IME</p></div></div></div>

<div class="sect1" title="Viewing Your System in Another Language"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="viewing_your_system_in_another_language"/>Viewing Your System in Another Language</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the many things that originally attracted me to the Linux world was being able to install language support for languages other than English and come up with a whole new system in a different language. On one of my machines, I have installed support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and my default, English. With just a simple logout and a few more clicks, I can log back in with an interface in a totally different language. I can have a Chinese, Japanese, or Swedish system whenever I want.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1119" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1120" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1121" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-11-1122" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This is very useful if you're in an environment where not everyone shares the same native language. At my former university, for example, where my Japanese and Chinese students sometimes used my computer, the additional language support allowed them to log in using their own language. It's even pretty handy if you are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself as much exposure as possible to it. All in all, it is a very useful feature.</p><p>Taking advantage of this feature in the GNOME environment is very easy. Basically all you have to do is install a group of support files for each language you want to add to your system. You can do this by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Language Support</strong></span>, after which the Language window will appear. In that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install/Remove Languages</strong></span> button. In the Installed Languages window that then appears, choose from the various languages available by checking the appropriate boxes. If you are installing language support for languages with complex writing systems, such as Japanese, be sure to also check the boxes next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Input methods</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Extra fonts</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch11s06.html#selecting_additional_languages_to_instal" title="Figure 11-17. Selecting additional languages to install">Figure 11-17</a>).</p><p>Once you have made your selections, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply Changes</strong></span> button. You will be prompted for your password at this point, so provide what is required, and the Language Support tool will begin downloading and then installing the support packages you specified. Once it is done, you will be notified and left with the Language window.</p><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_additional_languages_to_instal"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject11_d1e17330"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656465.png.jpg" alt="Selecting additional languages to install"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 11-17. Selecting additional languages to install</p></div><p>Once you have installed support for the additional languages you want, you can choose to have your system open in a different language environment by using the Language window (<span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Language Support</strong></span>).
