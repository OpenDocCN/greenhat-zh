    Windows XP is still the most popular Windows version, despite being a
    Methuselah in computer years as it was first released in 2001. Microsoft
    has tried several times to retire it, but it won’t go away. In July 2010,
    Microsoft announced an extension of support for XP SP3 through April 2014.
    XP will continue to be a downgrade option for Windows 7 buyers for the
    length of Windows 7’s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) life span,
    which ends two years after the next Windows version ships. So, XP is going
    to be with us for a long time yet.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are compelling reasons to stick with XP on your audio
    production computer. It is frugal of system requirements, needing less
    than 5GB for the operating system and service packs, and it runs
    acceptably with a 1 GHz CPU and 512MB RAM. Put it on a dual-core laptop
    with a gigabyte of RAM, and you have a capable portable recording
    studio.</p><p>Windows Vista didn’t get much traction in the marketplace. At the
    time this was written, audio hardware manufacturers were finally catching
    up and releasing Vista drivers for their products. Audacity
    1.3.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> runs fine on Vista. But Vista is a system
    resources hog, eating up a good 12+GB of hard drive space just for itself.
    Officially, it needs a minimum of a 1 GHz CPU and 512GB RAM for Vista Home
    Basic or 1GB RAM for other editions, but if that is all you have, it will
    feel like slogging through deep sand. It needs a 2 GHz CPU and 2GB RAM
    just for basic chores such as email and web surfing. I recommend a minimum
    2 GHz dual-core CPU and 4GB RAM for running Audacity on Vista.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Vista system requirements also apply to Windows 7. It’s not very
    different from Vista; it’s more polished, memory management is a little
    better, User Account Control is less annoying, and it boots up a little
    faster. The Sound control panel has a nice extra feature, a Communications
    tab with simple auto-duck settings for your playback device. You can
    configure it for tasks such as automatically muting all other sounds when
    you receive a Skype call.</p><div class="sect1" title="Enabling MP3 Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="enabling_mp3_support"/>Enabling MP3 Support</h1></div></div></div><p>Because of patent encumbrances on the MP3 audio format (or more
      precisely, MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3), an MP3 encoder is not included with
      Audacity. However, you can easily get the LAME MP3 encoder, which is a
      high-quality, cross-platform free software MP3 encoder and decoder. One
      way to get it is to follow the instructions on the Audacity download
      page. Another way is from inside Audacity, by exporting a file as MP3.
      If LAME is not present on your system, you’ll see a dialog like the one
      in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#to_install_lame_from_inside_audacity_com" title="Figure 14-1. To install LAME from inside Audacity, click the Download button in the MP3 Export dialog.">Figure 14-1</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button to go
      directly to the LAME download page. You can download either a zipped
      archive or an uncompressed archive. The installer is a standard Windows
      <span class="emphasis"><em>.exe</em></span> file; just download it, double-click the
      downloaded file, and go through the installation steps. It will put LAME
      into <span class="emphasis"><em>\Program Files\Lame For Audacity</em></span>. You can
      verify that it installed successfully by looking at the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Libraries</strong></span> dialog. Click MP3 Library: <span class="strong"><strong>Locate</strong></span>, and it will display the full file path

<div class="sect1" title="Enabling WMA, M4A/M4P Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="enabling_wma_comma_m4a_solidus_m4p_suppo"/>Enabling WMA, M4A/M4P Support</h1></div></div></div><p>Audacity offers native support for open, unencumbered audio codecs
      and formats such as WAV, AIFF, Ogg Theora, and FLAC. But just like with
      MP3s, Audacity cannot ship with support for closed, proprietary, or
      patent-encumbered formats such as Windows Media Audio (WMA), M4A (lossy,
      compressed format), or M4P (M4A with DRM added). M4A and M4P are the
      default formats for Apple’s iTunes store. They use the Advanced Audio
      Coding (AAC) codecs. No licenses or payments are required to distribute
      recordings in any form that use AAC, but anyone who makes an AAC encoder
      is required to purchase a patent license. Open source encoders get
      around this by releasing source code rather than a ready-to-use binary
      application and by hosting their download servers in friendly countries.
      Many countries do not enforce U.S. software patent laws, or even
      recognize the validity of software patents, and expressly allow
      reverse-engineering. So when it comes to figuring all this out, the
      Magic 8 Ball has the definitive answer: “Reply hazy, try
      again.”<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0020" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The short story is you can add support for a large number of
      nonfree and encumbered audio (and video) file formats by installing
      FFmpeg. Audacity has FFmpeg support built in, and you install it the
      same way as LAME. Just like LAME, it will be placed into
      <span class="emphasis"><em>\Program Files\FFmpeg for Audacity</em></span>.</p><p>Both LAME and FFmpeg can be installed, and their locations on your
      system can be verified from <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt;

<div class="sect1" title="Low-Latency Recording and Audio Driver Fun"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="low-latency_recording_and_audio_driver_f"/>Low-Latency Recording and Audio Driver Fun</h1></div></div></div><p>Making recordings on computers means you have to care about
      drivers. A lot.</p><p>The standard Windows Multi-Media Extensions (MME) sound system
      supports two-channel 16-bit 44.1Hz recording. This is an old system that
      has been around since Windows 3.1. Then Microsoft developed the Windows
      Driver Model Kernel Streaming (WDM/KS) and Enhanced Windows Driver Model
      (EWDM) drivers for Windows 2000 and newer. Audacity supports all of
      these. For recording more than two channels simultaneously, you want
      sound cards with full EWDM support. Most audio devices claim WDM
      support, but that doesn’t always mean EWDM or WDM/KS, so they may not
      support recording from more than two inputs at the same time.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0029" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Audio Streaming Input/Output (ASIO) driver is a high-quality,
      low-latency audio interface for Windows. Unfortunately, Audacity cannot
      ship with support for it because it is a closed, proprietary driver. So,
      you have two options: Stick with devices that support EWDM or WDM/KS, or
      compile Audacity with ASIO support yourself. To do this, you need the
      ASIO software developer’s kit (SDK) from Steinberg, the company that
      owns the ASIO driver, and the latest Audacity source code from its CVS
      repository on SourceForge. You’ll also need Microsoft Visual C++ 8,
      which is part of Visual Studio, to compile Audacity on
      Windows.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0031" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You’ll have to register for a developer account on Steinberg.net
      before you can download the ASIO SDK. This is free and easy. Follow the
      instructions on the Audacity download page to get the latest Audacity
      source code. Then find the <span class="emphasis"><em>win\compile.txt</em></span> file in
      the Audacity source tree, because it gives detailed instructions for
      building Audacity with ASIO support.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>There are some licensing issues you must be aware of. You can
        build your own copies of Audacity with ASIO support for personal use
        only: You cannot distribute them. This would violate both Audacity’s
        license (the GPL) and Steinberg’s license for ASIO. The Audacity
        maintainers encourage users to email Steinberg and politely request
        that it open source the ASIO driver.</p></div><p>The cheap and easy way is to ask a friend who already has
      Microsoft’s Visual Studio to help you. It may sound like a lot of
      trouble to compile Audacity to include ASIO support, but for someone who
      already knows their way around Visual Studio, it’s pretty simple. Do you
      need ASIO support in Audacity? No, if you shop carefully, you can find
      recording interfaces with good-quality EWDM or WDM/KS drivers. Just
      having an ASIO driver doesn’t guarantee that a device will perform well,
      because there are bad ASIO drivers. There are also bad EWDM and WDM/KS
      drivers, so do your homework before purchasing anything.</p><p>If you can find a way to enable ASIO support in Audacity, you’ll
      have a lot more hardware and configuration options. A lot of higher-end
      sound cards support multiple drivers, including ASIO and the WDM family,
      so you can try different ones to see which ones perform the best.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Tuning Windows for Best Performance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tuning_windows_for_best_performance"/>Tuning Windows for Best Performance</h1></div></div></div><p>Good audio recording requires a clean, well-performing computer
      that is not bogged down with unnecessary applications and services. Poor
      Windows is famous for getting loaded down with useless cruft, so we’re
      going to review how to give it a good housecleaning.</p><p>A common cause of slow performance is video controllers that use
      shared system memory. These suck up both CPU cycles and RAM. If you have
      one of these, it will be worth the money to get a discrete graphics
      controller; the difference in performance will be large and noticeable,
      because the processing load will be handled by the video card. If you
      have cheapo shared-memory video, you should be able to upgrade, whether
      it’s on a laptop or desktop PC. Your laptop will have very specific
      requirements, which you should be able to find out from your manual or
      the manufacturer’s website. A desktop PC should offer more
      flexibility.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0034" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You have to match your video card to your motherboard, because
      there are several different types of PCI slots for desktop PC video
      cards: PCI, AGP, and PCI-e. You have to match both the slot and the
      correct voltage. Also make sure there is enough room for your new video
      card, because some of them are monsters with giant cooling fans. These
      giant beasts are for gamers, not audio production rigs. Cheap and small
      will work fine. You may need to go into your system BIOS to disable
      onboard video, if you are already using that. If all of this sounds like
      a foreign language to you, you might look for a knowledgeable friend to
      assist or even pay a professional.</p><p>Always have the latest Windows updates installed, especially
      service packs. Make sure you have the latest drivers for your audio
      devices. Run Defrag and Disk Cleanup periodically.</p><p>Turn off everything that is not essential for recording: other
      applications, screensaver, antimalware, system maintenance applications,
      firewall, web browser, email, “entertainment” crapware, adware, fancy
      special effects—everything. Virus checkers and Windows firewalls are
      notorious system resource hogs, but disabling them obviously leaves your
      system unprotected so you’ll want to disconnect from any networks. Don’t
      forget to turn off wi-fi and Bluetooth. Some laptops have nice physical
      switches to turn these off; otherwise, go into the Network Connections
      control panel to disable them. If you need to stay connected, you’re
      stuck with keeping your protections turned on.</p><div class="figure"><a id="raising_audacityas_priority_in_the_task"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e19797"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797889.png.jpg" alt="Raising Audacity’s priority in the Task Manager"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 14-4. Raising Audacity’s priority in the Task Manager</p></div><p>Raise Audacity’s priority in the Task Manager. To bring up the
      Task Manager, press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">alt</span>-<span class="keycap">delete</span>.
      Press this combination only once, or Windows will reboot. Go to the
      Processes tab in the Task Manager and right-click the entry for Audacity
      (<a class="xref" href="ch14s04.html#raising_audacityas_priority_in_the_task" title="Figure 14-4. Raising Audacity’s priority in the Task Manager">Figure 14-4</a>). The
      default priority is normal, and you should be able to raise it to High
      without making other processes unhappy. Raising it to Realtime seems
      like the obvious choice, but it makes my system unstable. You may have
      better results.</p><p>You can safely disable a number of Windows services that consume
      memory and CPU cycles with little benefit to you, and some are even
      security risks. Third-party software vendors love to choke Windows with
      all kinds of junk. You can look at the Processes tab in the Task Manager
      to see what is using up the most CPU and memory, and then a quick web
      search should tell what the service is for and whether it’s something
      you need to keep or can evict. We’ll look at some common offenders in
      detail in the next two sections.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0037" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Tuning Windows XP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="tuning_windows_xp"/>Tuning Windows XP</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="fine-tuning_windows_xp_by_turning_off_un"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e19838"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797891.png.jpg" alt="Fine-tuning Windows XP by turning off unnecessary and dangerous services"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 14-5. Fine-tuning Windows XP by turning off unnecessary and
          dangerous services</p></div><p>First we’ll start with some easy stuff: In Windows XP,
        right-click My Computer and select Properties. Click the Advanced tab,
        and then click the Performance <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> button (<a class="xref" href="ch14s04.html#fine-tuning_windows_xp_by_turning_off_un" title="Figure 14-5. Fine-tuning Windows XP by turning off unnecessary and dangerous services">Figure 14-5</a>). On the Visual
        Effects tab, select “Adjust for best performance.” This turns off the
        basic Windows XP eye candy.</p><p>While you’re still in Performance Options, go to the Advanced
        tab. By default the Windows paging file is dynamic and changes its
        size according to demand. Change it to a fixed size in the Virtual
        memory menu; this gives you a little faster performance. If you have
        512MB RAM or less, set your swap file size to 1.5 times your RAM. For
        1GB to 4GB, make it half your RAM. For more than 4GB, try a minimal
        size like 512MB. You want Audacity using your nice fast RAM, not slow
        paging files.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The paging file is virtual memory. If Windows runs out of RAM,
          it uses the paging file that is on your hard drive. Reading and
          writing to a hard drive are many times slower than using RAM, so it
          is always better to have more RAM than to have a bigger paging
          file.</p></div><p>Now leave Performance Options and go to the System Restore tab.
        I recommend disabling System Restore by checking the “Turn Off System
        Restore on all drives” checkbox, though if you want to leave it on,
        that’s okay. In my experience, it takes up disk space and slows down
        your system a little bit without being all that useful, because it
        seems that failures and problems are faithfully preserved in System
        Restore. Your best protection, as always, is keeping regular data
        backups on external media.</p><p>Next, go to the Automatic Updates tab and turn them off. This
        means you have to remember to run updates manually—don’t forget! You
        don’t want the updater to kick in during a recording or editing
        session because it will bog down your system, pop up messages at you,
        and then nag you about restarting.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0042" class="indexterm"/></p><p>On the Remote tab, disable “Allow Remote Assistance invitations
        to be sent from this computer” and “Allow users to connect remotely to
        this computer.” Hello, big fat security holes anyone? And they use
        some system resources. You can always turn them on when you know you
        need them; the rest of the time they should be disabled.</p><p>We’re finished with System Properties and ready to move on. Now
        you want to look at any services that are set to start at boot and set
        the ones that don’t need to be running all the time to Manual or
        Disabled. Do this in the <span class="strong"><strong>Control
        Panel</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Administrative
        Tools</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Services</strong></span>
        dialog. A lot of third-party software lards down your system with all
        kinds of unnecessary baggage. One example is the USB Audio interfaces
        software CD that came with my M-Audio MobilePre. Windows XP already
        has a perfectly good USB audio interface built in, so you don’t need
        to install anything extra—the MobilePre works just fine without the
        extra guff, which is a driver installer and a rudimentary volume
        control panel. There’s nothing to get excited about, and there’s
        nothing particularly useful. A lot of USB audio devices do this, so
        try them first without installing anything extra.</p><p>Here is a short checklist of services that should be disabled
        because they are unnecessary or security risks, or both. It’s not
        necessary to track down and nuke every last not-absolutely-essential
        service, though you’re welcome to do so. TweakHound (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tweakhound.com/">http://www.tweakhound.com/</a>) is a thorough and reliable
        guide to Windows system tuning, including both good tweaks and bad
        tweaks. It is also helpful to do web searches on specific services.
        Don’t change anything without knowing what it does; you don’t want to
        nuke essential Windows services. When you change a running service to
        Manual or Disable, you will also have to stop it. Double-click the
        service to open a configuration dialog.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0043" class="indexterm"/></p><p>These are some of the more common offenders:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Alerter</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Sends administrative alerts.

To control
        display and special effects settings, first open the Control Panel and
        set it to the Classic View. Then open <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced
        System Settings</strong></span>. This opens the System Properties dialog,
        which has several tabs. Click the Advanced tab, click the Performance
        <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> button, and turn off all
        the bling by checking “Adjust for best performance.” This turns off
        all special effects (<a class="xref" href="ch14s04.html#turning_off_resource-hungry_special_effe" title="Figure 14-7. Turning off resource-hungry special effects">Figure 14-7</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0059" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Adjust your paging file size on the Advanced tab, which is next
        to the Visual Effects tab. By default, the Windows paging file is
        dynamic and changes its size according to demand. Change it to a fixed
        size for faster performance; click the <span class="strong"><strong>Change</strong></span> button under Virtual Memory. If you
        have 1GB RAM or less, set your swap file size to 1.5 times your RAM.
        For 1GB to 4GB, make it half your RAM. For more than 4GB, try a
        minimal size like 512MB. You want Audacity using your nice fast RAM,
        not slow paging files.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-0066" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Close Performance Options and go to the System Protection tab. I
        recommend turning off System Restore here, though I won’t complain if
        you want to leave it on. To disable it, uncheck all the boxes in the
        Automatic Restore Points box. In my experience, it eats up a lot of
        disk space without providing much benefit. I prefer to rely on good
        regular data backups, rather than hoping Windows can cure itself when
        there are problems.</p><p>Now go to the Remote tab and uncheck “Allow Remote Assistance
        connections to this computer.” This is a potential security hole, and
        you should turn it on only when you know you’re going to use it.
        You’re done here now, so click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>
        to close System Properties.</p><p>Windows Update, Windows Firewall, and Windows Defender are all
        configured in <span class="strong"><strong>Control Panel</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Security Center</strong></span>. To squeeze maximum
        performance out of Windows Vista/7, turn off everything. Of course,
        when you do this, your system is vulnerable, so don’t connect to any
        networks while you are doing audio work. Automatic Updating is
        especially troublesome because it will interrupt whatever you are
        doing whenever it runs, bother you with nag messages, and then in most
        cases want to reboot. Then the restart can take a long time as it
        applies and configures the updates. You can run the updater manually
        when it’s convenient for you.</p><p>Vista and 7 are better than previous Windows versions at not
        running bales of useless and dangerous services. But you should still
        go through and do a bit of weeding. Don’t change anything without
        knowing what it does; you don’t want to nuke essential Windows
        services. A quick web search on specific services should tell you what
        you need to know about them, especially if they are Windows services.
