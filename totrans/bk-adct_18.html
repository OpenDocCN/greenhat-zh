    die. The funny part is that a few blind listening tests would disprove
    them, or as the old geek saying goes, “One experiment is worth a thousand
    arguments.” Here are my favorites.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0164" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0165" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="The Myth of the Golden Ear"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_the_golden_ear"/>The Myth of the Golden Ear</h1></div></div></div><p>Some audiophiles love to obsess over specs and are convinced that,
      yes, they too can hear super-high frequencies just like bats, and the
      super-low frequencies just like whatever animal hears super-low
      frequencies, and they need every last possible hertz, and it must be
      filtered through special organic electricity or their listening
      experience is ruined. Their equipment must be elite and overpriced, and
      the Sacred Listening Room must be specially engineered. They are more
      sensitive than ordinary mortals, and we just don’t appreciate what they
      go through.</p><p>Salespeople and equipment reviewers exploit this attitude
      mercilessly. It’s a proven way to sell overpriced gear. These
      salespeople and reviewers don’t have any special hearing abilities, just
      acute sensitivities to the smell of money.</p><p>Of course, it is true that hearing acuity and perception vary
      among individual people, but in any random assortment of humans with
      good, undamaged hearing, the differentiator is how
      <span class="emphasis"><em>educated</em></span> their ears are. This is true of all of our
      senses—when you know what to look for, you become an ace birdwatcher.
      When you learn to differentiate different flavors, aromas, and
      characteristics in wine, it becomes a multifaceted pleasure instead of
      just an easy, pleasant buzz. Experienced riders learn how to interpret
      all the signals a horse gives—mood, intent, what’s ahead—and how to
      communicate back to the horse. Just like everything else we do,
      listening is a learning process. You might start out unable to tell the
      difference between a viola and a violin, but with experience you learn
      to identify the individual musicians in a band or orchestra. Even when
      it’s the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet. That’s right, four
      saxophone players and nothing else; two alto, one tenor, and one
      baritone sax. To the inexperienced ear, it’s just a blur of saxophones,
      but with a bit of listening, you can tell right away who is playing
      what.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0166" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0167" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Back in the olden analog days, they didn’t have super-duper hi-fi
      recording studios, and they sure as heck didn’t have super-duper hi-fi
      playback devices. The best recordings from the olden days feature
      talented, skilled musicians and talented, skilled engineers who knew how
      to get the most out of their equipment. If specs are all that matter, we
      might as listen to pure sine waves. There are no shortcuts to spending
      time listening, comparing, experimenting, and learning to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>listen</em></span>.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth of Burn-In"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_burn-in"/>The Myth of Burn-In</h1></div></div></div><p>This is another one that deserves a wooden stake through its
      vitals. Audio electronics and speakers sound the same when they’re
      brand-new as they do after decades of use, barring damage and component
      failure. Giving them a period of “burn-in,” which is simply switching
      them on and then leaving them on for whatever magic burn-in interval is
      required, is silly and does nothing to change how they sound.</p><p>Tube amp-o-philes are particularly prone to burn-in fits and will
      insist that a new amp sounds “cold” and, after 24 hours or whatever,
      sounds “warm.” ’Taint so; it’s all the same. There are many things that
      affect how we perceive sounds: temperature, humidity, mood, whether we
      are rested or tired, whether we have been in a quiet or noisy
      environment all day. Audio electronics are pretty much always the
      same.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth of Tube Superiority"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_tube_superiority"/>The Myth of Tube Superiority</h1></div></div></div><p>Tube amps are obsolete. Solid-state does everything they can do,
      cheaper and better and with less distortion. Tube amps need more service
      over their lifetimes because tubes burn out and lose power, and you
      might even need to re-tension their sockets. You’ve probably heard
      lyrical odes to the “tube sound.” Tube amps are perfectly good for those
      who prefer them. If there is a “tube sound” that you like, it is most
      likely distortion created by the amp. If you want your amps to be
      neutral and reproduce your audio as accurately as possible, you want
      solid-state.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0168" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0169" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0170" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth of Uber Cables"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_uber_cables"/>The Myth of Uber Cables</h1></div></div></div><p>You’re welcome to spend significant wads of money on cables if you
      really want to. You’ll probably get more enjoyment out of papering your
      walls with dollar bills, lighting cigars with twenties, or making
      stylish garments out of Ben Franklins, because spending gobs of money on
      audio cables does not make them better than sensibly priced cables.
      You’ll want to avoid weird, cruddy, no-name brands, but otherwise any
      cable that is manufactured to the appropriate specifications is equal to
      any other. Look for good construction, strong connectors, good
      insulation, and specs and identifying information printed on the
      sheaths. Sometimes there are useful options like right-angle plugs or
      swivel plugs. If you want to waste your money, do please pick something
      more worthy than overpriced audio cables.</p><p>Gold-plated connectors add shininess, higher price tags, and some
      corrosion resistance. They don’t make the sound better.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0171" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0172" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth of Analog Superiority"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_of_analog_superiority"/>The Myth of Analog Superiority</h1></div></div></div><p>Analog audio cannot compete with digital audio for fidelity;
      signal-to-noise ratio; lack of distortion; and ease of editing,
      manipulation, and reproduction. Some folks like analog artifacts such as
      the “fat” sound of pushing analog circuits to their limits, distortion,
      feedback, and so on. No worries, everyone is entitled to their
      preferences. Though it’s worth noting these can be reproduced in digital
      audio.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth That You Don&#x2019;t Need Tone Controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_that_you_donat_need_tone_contro"/>The Myth That You Don’t Need Tone Controls</h1></div></div></div><p>This one really gets my goat. You enter the high-end snooty audio
      store to try out some high-quality equipment. Hey, why not, you won’t
      know until you listen to it, right? You are escorted to The Room of
      Acoustic Perfection. There you are seated in the precisely positioned
      Listening Chair, in front of banks of speakers, amps, preamps, no
      receivers because those are not snooty enough, and high-end CD players.
      These are all connected to a switching system so that you can easily try
      out different combinations. Very nice so far. Your salesperson will be
      into something above the common herd; perhaps jazz, maybe some
      classical, maybe some off-the-wall independent labels. Certainly no Top
      40 or teenybop pop.</p><p>So on goes the music, and you sink back into pleasant bliss. But
      as you listen, you notice it’s not quite right. You want a little less
      treble, perhaps, and a little more bass. Maybe the midrange is a touch
      wimpy and you want to kick it up a tick or two. Tough luck, buster,
      because those fine amps only control volume and balance. You don’t get
      tone controls. Why? Because, as the salesperson explains, real
      audiophiles listen to the music as it is “meant to be listened to.” So
      no tone controls for you, and if you want any, then you are defective.
      Though not too defective to drop a few thousand dollars on a hi-fi
      system with no tone controls; fortunately, the salesperson is
      magnanimous and will permit you to do that.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0173" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Unfortunately, this is a complete myth. Most recordings are not
      “perfectly engineered”; all of them are compromises. Because even the
      best-engineered recordings are not proof against the environments they
      are played in or the individual characteristics of your hi-fi
      components. They will sound different depending what they are played on,
      the rooms they are played in, temperature and humidity, your moods—every
      day it’s a little different, and God gave us tone controls so we could
      hear recordings the way we want to. Maybe you have some big bad feelings
      to work off and need some aggressive subwoofering. Maybe you want it
      light and soothing. Maybe you just like to twiddle knobs. That is your
      right, and you must not allow pretentious salespersons to take it away
      from you.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The Myth That Someone Else Knows Better Than You"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_myth_that_someone_else_knows_better"/>The Myth That Someone Else Knows Better Than You</h1></div></div></div><p>For the most part, fussy audiophiles are fussy about all the wrong
      things. There are two categories of people who can teach you actual
      useful knowledge, and those are musicians and recording engineers. I
      mean real musicians and real recording engineers, not wannabes who think
      that when the knob goes to 11 it means the amp is louder than amps that
      go to 10. Recording engineers are just as much artists as engineers, and
      even mediocre ones can teach you a lot about the nuts and bolts of
      making recordings.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0174" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It takes practice, experimentation, and a lot of listening, and
      the ultimate decision about what is good is entirely yours. You have to
      learn to train your own ear and taste and not depend on what other
      people tell you because they don’t experience audio the same way you do.
      Especially if they’re trying to sell you something.</p></div></body></html>
