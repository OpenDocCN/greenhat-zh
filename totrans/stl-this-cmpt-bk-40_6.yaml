    defect or because they didn't want it any longer even though it may have been
    working perfectly well. Once a manufacturer receives a returned computer, it's
    torn apart, the components are tested, and then it's reassembled to be just like
    new. There's just one problem. Legally, manufacturers can't sell a returned computer
    as new.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for resale, they'll reduce the price significantly just to get rid of it. If the
    computer were to fail a second time and force another customer to return it, the
    manufacturer would lose still more money fixing it again, so refurbished computers
    are often examined even more carefully than new ones are.

    a refurbished computer can be a great way to get a top-of-the-line machine without
    paying top-of-the-line prices. Refurbished computers come with the same technical
    support and warranty as their identical brand-new models, but with one major drawback.
    When you buy a refurbished computer, you can only buy what the manufacturer has
    in stock that day. If you want to customize your computer, you'll probably have
    to splurge on something new or be prepared to buy the accessories you want and
    install them yourself.

    have come up with several tactics to force consumers to buy inkjet cartridges

    them from being refilled. The moment a cartridge runs out of ink, the chip prevents
    it from ever being used again, no matter how much you refill it with replacement
    ink, although you can buy new chips from SmartChipSolutions ([www.smartchipsolutions.com](http://www.smartchipsolutions.com))
    to trick your printer into accepting a third-party replacement ink cartridge.
    However, Lexmark and Hewlett-Packard have also even patented the print heads on
    certain inkjet cartridges, thereby preventing anyone from making a compatible
    replacement cartridge. If you can't find a replacement inkjet cartridge for your

- en: The biggest difference between electronic data and traditional data is that
    once you store electronic data on any form of magnetic media, it can stay there
    much longer than you expect. To understand how it's possible to recover a file
    that's been deleted, you need to understand how computers store and organize files
    on a disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a computer stores information on a disk, it can't just toss it anywhere,
    because that would make it difficult to find it again—it would be like throwing
    your socks on your bedroom floor and then wondering why you can never find a matching
    pair when you need one. To help organize data, computers divide disks into multiple
    *tracks*, which you can think of as circular storage bins on the surface of a
    disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each track is divided into smaller parts called *sectors*. A group of sectors
    is called a *cluster*. When you save data to your disk, your computer stores your
    file in multiple sectors. When you add or delete data from a file, the total number
    of sectors used to store your file grows or shrinks accordingly. Basically, a
    sector is a tiny box that contains part of a single file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, your computer tries to store files as one continuous track, which allows
    it to retrieve data quickly. However, the more you save, edit, and delete files,
    the more likely it is that the computer will have to store one part of a file
    in one sector and another part of that same file in another sector, on a completely
    different part of the disk. When you defragment your hard disk, you're essentially
    rearranging all your files so the data from each file gets stored in adjacent
    sectors once more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To keep track of which sectors contain which files, every disk contains a special
    directory, sometimes called a File Allocation Table (FAT) or a Master File Table
    (MFT). The FAT or MFT (or whatever name your particular computer uses) lists all
    the files stored on the disk along with pointers that identify the exact tracks
    and sectors that contain each file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you delete a file, your computer takes a shortcut. Instead of physically
    destroying the data, the computer simply erases its existence from the disk's
    directory, which pretends that the file no longer exists, although the contents
    of the file are still intact. Only when the computer needs the space taken up
    by the deleted file will it actually overwrite the old information with new data.
    This is like taking your name off your apartment building's directory when you
    move out, but leaving your unwanted belongings behind in your old apartment. Only
    when someone else moves in do the old contents of the apartment get thrown out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your disk has plenty of extra space available, you could go weeks, months,
    or even years before the data in those deleted sectors is overwritten. (You can
    accomplish almost the same thing as overwriting the data, however, by defragmenting
    your hard drive regularly.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can usually retrieve a trashed file by running an undelete utility program
    right away. An undelete utility simply changes the disk directory to identify
    any "deleted" files, so that the computer will recognize the files again. Of course,
    the longer you wait to run the utility, the more likely your computer will have
    overwritten some, or possibly all, of a particular deleted file's contents with
    new data, making it difficult, if not impossible, to recover the original contents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some utility programs, such as the Norton Utilities, come with a file-deletion
    protection feature that saves any deleted files in a special folder so that you
    can quickly and accurately recover them any time in the future. Obviously, this
    feature can be a lifesaver if you accidentally delete something important, but
    it can also work against you by preserving sensitive files you thought you got
    rid of months ago.

    which defines acceptable government standards for deleting computer files. The
    DoD technique wipes a file seven times, each pass replacing the deleted data with
    a different set of random data that further obscures the original. Seven passes
    can destroy virtually all traces of the original file, although theoretically

    but do nothing to hide or erase information copied from the file into temporary
    files on your hard disk. For example, Microsoft Word typically creates a temporary
    copy of your document as an emergency backup, just in case your computer crashes
    or the power goes out. Then you can recover your work by loading this temporary
    file. However, if you create a sensitive document and encrypt it, all of your
    sensitive data still remains inside Word's emergency backup copy of your file,
    which anyone can open and read.

    disks, rewritable CDs, etc.) into chunks of a fixed size known as clusters. When
    you store a file, the entire file rarely fits in a single cluster, so Windows
    stores it in multiple clusters. Almost inevitably, the last part of a file won't
    completely fill up its cluster, and it's this extra space that's known as *slack
    space*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computers often use the slack space to store information about that particular
    file. For example, when you open a file (say, for editing) and type anything from
    the key-board, the operating system may temporarily store your keystrokes in a
    portion of memory called the keyboard buffer. Without the keyboard buffer, you
    could type too fast for the computer to react, and it could lose keystrokes. When
    you close the file, the computer may then clear the keyboard buffer by dumping
    its contents into that file's slack space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you delete parts of a file, that file's slack space grows and traces of the
    previous file version are left behind there. If you delete or encrypt a file,
    the slack space remains untouched because it is not actually part of the file.
    Until you overwrite the slack space with random data, any information dumped there
    can still be recovered.

- en: One particularly vulnerable area of your computer is the swap file. A *swap
    file* allocates part of your hard disk for temporarily storing data from its working
    memory, known as *random-access memory (RAM)*, so that the computer can free up
    some of this space to use for running programs as needed. Without swap files,
    your computer would have to store both a running program and any open files it
    is using in RAM. So, if you opened an extremely large file, that could be enough
    to gobble up all of your memory and prevent other programs from running. By selectively
    swapping data back and forth between the hard disk and the RAM, an operating system
    can run more than one program at a time, even if their total memory requirement
    theoretically exceeds what's actually available. (This trick used by the computer
    to manage running programs is where the name "swap file" comes from.)

    as the contents of a report or a budget that you're working on, in the swap file—typically
    when the program is momentarily idle. When you save or delete the data file, much
    of the file's data may still remain in the swap file.

    (whimsically dubbed FREDs), and portable versions called Forensic Recovery Evidence
    Device Diminutive Interrogation Equipment (FREDDIEs). If you see the police hauling
    a FRED or FREDDIE into your computer room, brace yourself. They'll be able to
    copy data from any hard disk or other removable storage device, such as rewritable
    DVDs; create images of your entire hard disk; connect directly to your computer
    and monitor any communications that your friends are trying to send to you; examine
    any visible and hidden partitions for data; and capture video images of the appearance
    and location of equipment at the scene.

    flaws have been on Windows systems. But Macs may not be as safe as their owners
    think. In 2006, a hacker released a proof-of-concept worm that exploited a flaw
    in the Safari browser. So if you want to keep your Macintosh secure, stop using
    Safari (which most hackers will attack because it's used by default on every Macintosh
    computer), and start using an alternate browser such as Firefox, Opera, or Camino
    ([www.caminobrowser.org](http://www.caminobrowser.org)). Just remember that every
    program has flaws that can be exploited. As alternate browsers like Firefox become
    more popular, expect hackers to start exploiting Firefox flaws as often as they
    target Internet Explorer flaws.

    spam filtering, but you'll want to make sure you turn those features on. (If your
    ISP doesn't offer these services, consider switching to a different vendor.) No
    matter how wonderful your ISP may claim its spam filters are, chances are they
    still won't be enough, so consider using a separate spam filter as well.
  prefs: []

    Both can block spam that your ISPs filters might miss.

    features of your email client too. Microsoft Outlook comes with a spam filter,
    but many worms know how to exploit Outlook to email copies of themselves to everyone
    in your address book. Instead, consider switching to the free Thunderbird email
    program ([www.mozilla.com/thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird)), developed
    by the same people who brought you the Firefox browser. Not only can Thunderbird
    foil mass-emailing worms, it can also filter out spam at the same time. By running
    spam through your ISP's spam filter, a separate spam filter, and finally your
    email program's spam filter, even though you still won't eliminate all unwanted
    mail, you'll reduce the flood to a mere trickle.

    victims to a bogus website masquerading as a legitimate one (see [Chapter 13](ch13.html
    "Chapter 13. The Internet Con Artists")). As soon as a phishing victim types her
    credit card number, password, or bank account number on the website accessed by
    clicking a link in the email, the thief can gain access to the victim's personal
    accounts and money.
