- en: Because Linux owes much of its growth and development to the Internet, it should
    come as no surprise that a wealth of information about the various flavors of
    Linux, including Ubuntu, is available online. In addition to the usual news, how-to,
    and download sites, you will find a variety of tutorials, forums, blogs, and other
    sources of useful information—all of which you can turn to as you use and learn
    more about your system.

- en: When you are looking for advice, trying to solve a particular problem, or just
    looking for some general tips, online forums are the way to go. Fortunately, Ubuntu
    has a forum all its own, and since Ubuntu is primarily a desktop-oriented Linux
    distro, you are likely to find many fellow newbies and newbie-friendly posters
    there (rather than the hard-core geeks you might find on some other sites). There
    are, of course, other newbie-friendly forums, which, although not Ubuntu-specific,
    should also be able to provide you with lots of helpful information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of which forum you are posting in, just be sure to mention that you
    are using Ubuntu, which version you have (Precise Pangolin, in case you forgot),
    and that you are new to Linux. And remember always to seek clarification when
    you get an answer you don’t understand. The same poster will usually come back
    and restate things for you. You should feel right at home at most of these sites,
    though you will probably come to like one or two more than the others.
