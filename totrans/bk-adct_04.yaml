    can capture a live performance. The Zoom H2, which is my favorite compact digital
    recorder, has four built-in microphones. You can use either the front pair or
    rear pair or all four at once to create a spatial, three-dimensional sound. The
    Zoom comes with a little stand to put it on any flat surface and a handle that
    fits into a mic stand so you can easily position it anywhere ([Figure 4-1](ch04.html#the_zoom_h2_on_a_microphone_stand

    to a mixer. Usually in live shows all instruments and vocalists are connected
    to a single sound console, and even the most low-budget console should have a
    pair of stereo RCA recording outputs. The Zoom uses a two-RCA-to-1/8″ stereo TRS
    adapter, as shown in [Figure 4-2](ch04.html#zoom_h2_with_a_two-rca-to-1_solidus_8p_s

    live recording. How do you do this? With the right knowledge and a big enough
    budget to support all the necessary equipment. Audacity records as many tracks
    at one time as your recording interface supports, starting with version 1.3.9\.
    Older Audacity releases support a maximum of 16\. (See [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Multitrack

    things the wrong way will result in bad sound or even damaged equipment. If you
    do not have control of the PA system at the venue, then you will need the cooperation
    and help of the resident sound engineer. Here are four different ways to approach
    making live multitrack recordings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One option is to supply your own microphones and mic every performer and instrument
    separately from the venue’s sound system. Although this means a lot of microphones
    and cables everywhere, this lets you use your own recording equipment independently
    of the main sound board.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A more common option is to use microphone and instrument cable splitters to
    make each mic and instrument cable do double duty. This is how many professionals
    record live concerts; they share mics that are run through splitters, and each
    team controls its own recording console. Sometimes these are tucked away backstage,
    and sometimes they have long cable runs running outside to mobile recording trucks.
    This setup has a lot of flexibility, and you can add your own mics as you see
    fit. For example, it seems to be a rule that no two people can agree on the correct
    way to mic drums, so they will set up their own drum mics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll need splitters, transformers, maybe some resistors and patch panels,
    and cables, and you’ll need to know how to connect everything. You’ll need to
    know the ins and outs of dealing with phantom power and who supplies it, connecting
    and disconnecting in the correct order, getting along with the other stage and
    sound crews, and lots more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One more option is to connect directly to a mixing console that supports multichannel
    outputs. (A good word to know is *busses*—the more busses a mixer has, the more
    flexible its signal routing options.) Then you don’t need redundant mics or splitters
    and long cable runs. Look for *direct outs*, *aux sends*, or *subgroup outs*.
    Some outputs send signals that are affected by the mixer controls, so they’ll
    have fades and special effects as applied by the console technician. If you want
    a straight unprocessed signal, that will depend on the features of the sound console
    and what the sound tech can let you use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are the sound engineer and get to use your own equipment, consider getting
    a multichannel digital mixer, like the PreSonus StudioLive 16-Channel FireWire
    Digital Mixer. Then you don’t need a separate ADC/DAC, and you don’t have to puzzle
    out how to make analog consoles designed for live shows also make good digital
    recordings. Sadly, the StudioLive is not supported on Linux, but it has excellent
    software bundles for Mac and Windows. This is a super nice, new generation mixer
    that is designed to support multichannel recording, both in the studio and in
    the performance hall. It costs about $2,000, plus you’ll also need an amplifier

    It’s no good setting a higher sampling rate (upsampling) than your recording interface
    supports because there is no magic quality infusion. It wastes disk space and
    bogs down your CPU, and upsampling hurts audio quality. But there are benefits
    to recording at 32-bit float even on 16-bit sound cards, which is explained in
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish"). (See [16/44.1,

    that delivers a 16/48 digital signal via USB. It plugs right into your computer,
    so you don’t need a sound card. So you could set Audacity to record at 32-bit
    float/48 for maximum quality. If 16/48 isn’t good enough, you could connect an
    outboard ADC that supports higher bit depths and sampling rates to the Xenyx’s
    RCA analog recording outputs.

    export to different quality levels as I need them, such as 24-bit WAV and FLAC
    for highest quality or the lower-quality Ogg Theora or MP3 formats. If you prefer

    difference in recordings made at 48 kHz compared to 44.1 kHz recordings, but I
    have to be listening for it on a good sound system. There is a more noticeable

    Because digital recording has such a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is also
    called a *low noise floor*, you can set a conservative peak level to allow for
    the unpredictability of a live performance. It’s not like recording on tape where
    we had to push recording levels as high as possible to keep noise levels at acceptable
    levels; you don’t want to go over zero in digital audio because that causes distortion.
    I aim for a peak level of -24 dB for live shows. The Meter toolbar has a little

    it does not link to the tracks below it. But a label track that lies underneath
    your audio tracks, which is where new label tracks always appear when you create
    new ones, creates a track group that includes all the audio tracks above it. Link
    Tracks is enabled by default, so if it gets in your way, just click the **Link
    Tracks** button to turn it off. Newer Audacity versions display chain links that
    appear when you make any selection or Time Shift tracks to indicate that Link
    Tracks is active ([Figure 4-10](ch04s03.html#chain_links_appear_when_the_link_tracks

    other edits. It will sound just like the playback in Audacity sounds, so when
    it sounds right in Audacity, it’s ready to go. First set your left, right, and

    For example, in podcasts that have more than one person talking, it’s a kindness
    to your listeners to make sure that the volume levels of the various people speaking
    are all the same. Compression is also used to change the character of sounds.
    For example, drums are mostly rapid peak sounds, so a bit of compression is used
    to give them a fuller, richer sound. Compression can make a vocalist or instrument
    “pop” out of the mix and make it sound more vivid. Compression can also help level
    out an erratic performer, such as a singer with bad mic technique or an instrumentalist
    who doesn’t have good volume control but is loud and soft at the wrong times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you can accomplish with compression will be limited by your recordings.
    If you have multitrack recordings with every performer and instrument on their
    own tracks, or usefully subgrouped, then you have all kinds of editing flexibility.
    If your recording is two-track stereo, then you can’t edit very surgically, but
    you can apply compression to the whole recording to make it sound better in noisy
    environments, such as vehicles and workplaces. Controlling it yourself means you
    can measure out just the right amount.
  prefs: []

    In the olden days of tape, compression techniques like Dolby noise reduction were
    used to minimize tape hiss. Music was compressed in the recording and then expanded
    on playback to lower the noise floor. Digital audio has such a high signal-to-noise

    gain of the audio signal is reduced. A threshold of -60 dB means everything with
    an amplitude of -60 dB and above will have reduced gain, which in most cases is
    too much, since that will be everything. A threshold of -10 dB means the loudest
    10 dB of your track will have its gain reduced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Noise Floor setting prevents background noise from being amplified during
    pauses by keeping the gain constant until the signal comes back up to the Threshold
    level; it does not allow the gain to increase in quiet passages that are below
    the Noise Floor decibel setting. If there are no quiet pauses in your audio, then
    this setting won’t help much, and you should move the slider all the way to the
    left, -80 dB, to make it have no effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Ratio setting controls how much compression, or reduction in gain, will
    be applied to sounds that are higher than your Threshold setting. A higher ratio,
    such as 4:1, means more compression. An input signal of 4 dB higher than your
    threshold will be reduced to 1 dB higher than the threshold, so it applies a 3
    dB reduction. Try gentler ratios first, starting at 2:1, and then listen to the
    preview. If it’s not enough, try a higher ratio. Audacity’s compressor has a maximum
    ratio of 10:1, which is a lot. Other compressors go as high as 60:1.
  prefs: []

    how long it takes to phase out the compression. A too-short Attack Time might
    result in some audible distortion, and a too-long Decay Time might miss some short

    it after applying compression. The Compressor effect has a “Make-up gain for 0
    dB after compressing” checkbox, which is another way of saying apply normalization
    to 0 dB. I don’t use it because I prefer to control normalization separately,
    and I don’t always normalize to 0 dB, but it’s there if you want to save a step.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also a “Compress based on Peaks” checkbox. When this box is unchecked,
    which is the default, the compressor reduces the gain on sounds above the Threshold
    level using RMS values. “Compress based on Peaks” raises the gain on quieter sounds

    one big shouting blob all boosted to the maximum, sometimes even into distortion.

    such as Ogg, FLAC, and MP3.) This is not the same as CD text. CD text is a nonstandard
    extension to the Red Book CD Audio format that displays song titles on CD players
    that support it. Most software CD players support CD text, and so do newer home
    and car CD players. Most CD-writing software supports CD text, so you can enter
    the individual song titles when you are authoring the CD. Some CD-writing programs
    (such as Nero, which runs on both Linux and Windows) extract song titles from
    the filenames, which is a lovely time-saver.

- en: This has been a great journey, from recording to editing, and now you are two
    steps away from creating CDs of your great recordings. The second-to-last step
    is to export your recordings to the correct format for CDs, which is 16/44.1 two-channel
    WAV. This is also the step where your tracks are broken up into individual song
    files. (If your project has more than two tracks, please see [Editing and Downmixing
    Multitrack Recordings](ch04s03.html#editing_and_downmixing_multitrack_record "Editing
    and Downmixing Multitrack Recordings") in [Editing and Downmixing Multitrack Recordings](ch04s03.html#editing_and_downmixing_multitrack_record

- en: Now you have a batch of nice individual WAV files, one file per song. Use your
    favorite CD-burning program to put your tunes on a CD. Be sure to create an audio
    project and not a data project, because CDs must be in the Red Book Audio format
    to play in all CD players. Set your burn speed to half the maximum as coaster
    insurance. Some CD-writing programs, like Nero, automatically grab the song titles
    from your WAV filenames, which is a nice time-saver. Most CD-writing programs
    create a default two-second gap between songs, so watch out for this. You can
    make a live album that sounds like one long, unbroken track by eliminating these
    gaps and still have individual song tracks so you can skip around.

    huge amounts of money. There are many laser CD duplicators that are like your
    computer’s CD burner, only faster and with multiple trays. These range from about
    $400 for simple duplicators with manual feeds to several thousand dollars for
    automatic feeds and local data storage.

    such as cover art and design. These can be cost-effective and save you time and
    hassle. The best CDs are pressed rather than burned. A duplication service that
    uses a press rather than a laser duplicator costs more and usually requires larger
    runs. But your discs will last longer.

    All CDs are exactly the same type, but it is worth sticking with good brands like
    Taiyo Yuden (my favorite). Verbatim, Ridata, and MAM-A are also reliable brands.
    Always get CD-R; don’t bother with CD-RW except for experimentation. See [There
    Is Not a Special Audio CD](ch05.html#there_is_not_a_special_audio_cd "There Is
