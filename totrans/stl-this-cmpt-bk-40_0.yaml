    will turn you into a soldier. You won't find step-by-step instructions explaining
    how to break into a computer, nor will you find technical discussions of all the
    flaws inherent to any particular type of operating system. This isn't a technical
    book about computer hacking. This is a philosophy book about the implications
    of hacking. Hacking isn't just about breaking into computers. Hacking is about
    exploring, extending boundaries, and searching for knowledge for its own sake.

    buffer overflows in an Apache server, or you want to find out how to configure
    a SonicWALL firewall to protect a corporate network from attack, look somewhere
    else. But if you want a book that explores both the technical and social implications
    of the hidden, darker side of the Internet that most people never see, read about,
    or hear about, keep reading. The world of hackers, virus writers, political activists,
    phone phreakers, censorship, and disguised propaganda awaits you.

    teach you to think like one. That means challenging your preconceived notions
    about right and wrong and looking beyond the limitations of your culture's way
    of thinking. Computers and the Internet can open your mind to new worlds that
    you've never dreamed of—or turn off your mind and funnel your thinking down the
    narrow confines of a fantasy world that only you choose to see. The choice is
    yours.

    revolution. The world of computers and the Internet is fraught with hidden dangers
    that the computer marketing departments don't mention, such as Trojan horses,
    electronic espionage, remote computer monitoring, hate groups, con artists, pedophiles,
    pornography, and terrorism—all just a mouse click away.

    people create them in the first place. The more you know about something, the
    better you can avoid or fight it. Besides exploring the underground nature of
    the Internet that television and magazine ads conveniently ignore, this book exposes
    the darker side of the computer industry itself.

    Do the same thing to an enemy's computer network, and your government may proclaim
    you a hero. Good and evil depend solely on your point of view.

    curious and not letting obstacles get in your way, can encompass activities as
    diverse as lockpicking and exploring abandoned buildings. What you'll find in
    this book are discussions of hacking covering a wide range of topics that happen
    to include computers.

    long before the invention of the computer. These early hacking techniques involved
    the telephone system, and, not surprisingly, these old telephone hacking techniques
    are gaining new life in the world of VoIP (voice over Internet protocol), which
    allows people to place calls over the Internet.

    also pioneered the art of human hacking known as *social engineering*. Social
    engineering means nothing more than smooth talking a victim into revealing valuable
    information such as passwords, ID numbers, or even names of certain people. Although
    it has its roots in phone phreakers trying to glean bits of information about
    the telephone system from reluctant telephone operators and technicians, social
    engineering has made a prominent return to the headlines in the form of phishing
    and identity theft, in which hackers use the Internet to social engineer victims
    out of their passwords, credit card data, and Social Security numbers. What's
    old is new again, and by understanding the hacking techniques of the past, you
    can better predict the hacking threats of the future.

    who specialized in cracking copy-protection software, writing viruses and Trojan
    horses, and mingling with like-minded individuals on electronic bulletin boards

    software industry still hasn't found a way to eradicate these early hacker threats,
