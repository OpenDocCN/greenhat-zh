    selecting some object or objects. Of all Inkscape operations, selecting has, by
    far, the greatest number of methods, tools, dialogs, and shortcuts available.
    You need to know a good portion of them to be able to work efficiently, and at
    least a few of them to be able to work in Inkscape at all.

    which may include anything—from no objects (empty selection, nothing selected)
    to all the objects in the document. Selection is local to the editing window;
    if you open a second window with the same document (**[3.5 Instances, Documents,
    Views](ch03s05.html "3.5 Instances, Documents, Views")**), that window will have
    its own independent list of selected objects. Selected objects can be anywhere
    on the canvas, in any layer or group; multiple selected objects don’t have to
    be children of the same parent. The only thing you *cannot* do is select an object
    and its ancestor at the same time (**[5.10 Selecting in Groups](ch05s10.html "5.10
    Selecting in Groups")**).

    only visible for selected objects, so if you select one stop, you’re creating
    a subselection within the regular object selection.

    you change selections. Perhaps most importantly, the selected style indicator
    in the status bar (**[8.1 Style Fundamentals](ch08s01.html "8.1 Style Fundamentals")**)
    displays the style of the subselection—that is, the style of the selected text
    fragment and not the entire text, or the style of the selected gradient stop and
    not the entire object. Also, any style setting commands (such as clicking a color
    on the palette, or pasting a style by pressing ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735400.png.jpg))
    will apply to the subselection if it is present. In other words, subselection
    allows you to deal with parts of your objects almost as though they are separate
    objects in their own right.

    and that clicking an object with that tool selects that object. Of course, there
    is much more to the Selector tool than that, but let’s look at this simple action
    in more detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'First, note that clicking an object *deselects* any previous selection. Also,
    observe that with the Selector tool, you can not only select objects, but also
    *drag* the selected objects in any direction. Combined, these two features make
    it extremely easy and natural to move objects around, almost without thinking
    about “selection” at all: You see an object, and you click and drag it to where
    you want it. The click selects it, deselecting anything else, and the drag moves
    it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, this may be an annoyance. Especially if you use a tablet with a pen
    and not a mouse, you may find that it’s too easy to accidentally nudge an object
    when all you intended to do was just select it by clicking. To make this less
    of a problem, go to the **Mouse** tab of the **Inkscape Preferences** dialog and
    adjust the **Click/drag threshold** value. This sets the allowed “slippage” in
    screen pixels, the default being 4; if you click and drag an object by less than
    this many pixels, your action is still considered a click and the object does
    not move. Increase this value if you often end up accidentally moving objects
    instead of clicking them; conversely, decrease it if you find that objects annoyingly
    “stick” more than you like when you really want to move them.

    in the right place so that your click will not be wasted. Here, Inkscape is very
    helpful: It changes your mouse cursor when you are over a clickable area of an
    object, as opposed to an empty canvas where the cursor is an arrow. The exact
    shape of the over-the-object cursor is different on different platforms; for example,
    on Ubuntu Linux it looks like a hand, while on Windows it looks like a cross with
    arrows on the ends.'
  prefs: []

    with no fill cannot be selected by clicking inside them and that fully transparent
    objects are not selectable by clicking at all (although you can select them with
    the rubber band, as you’ll see in the next section). In Outline mode (**[3.11
    Rendering Modes](ch03s11.html "3.11 Rendering Modes")**), you can select any object
    only by clicking its outline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can imagine, this changing cursor is less helpful in complex drawings
    where the entire canvas is often covered with objects. However, if you separate
    all the background objects into a layer and lock that layer (**[4.6 Layers](ch04s06.html
    "4.6 Layers")**), then these background objects, now unselectable, will stop changing
    the cursor—and you can again sense the foreground objects by moving your mouse
    over them.
  prefs: []

    pixels wide, on all sides. A click in that margin will still select that object.
    This is very handy for selecting small objects which would otherwise be almost
    impossible to accurately click upon. On the downside, this also explains why it’s
    sometimes so difficult to select the bottom object in a stack even if that bottom
    object protrudes a little from under the top one.

    threshold** are in screen pixels. This means they do not depend on zoom, so even
