    hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any moment. They have a
    great distrust of hardware people and wish that systems could be virtual at all
    levels. They would like personal computers (you know no one's going to trip over
    something and kill your DFA in mid-transit), except that they need 8 megabytes
    to run their Correctness Verification Aid packages.
