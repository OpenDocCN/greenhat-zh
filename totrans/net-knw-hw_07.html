This connector, along with the hardware that controls it, is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>network adapter</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>network interface</em></span> because it's the point of contact between the computer and the network. In a small home or business network, the network interface can be either an Ethernet port that communicates with the network through a cable or a wireless transmitter and receiver that exchanges radio signals with a Wi-Fi base station. This chapter describes the most common wired Ethernet network interfaces. <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. WI-FI NETWORKS">Chapter 8</a> provides similar information about connecting your computer to a network through a wireless interface.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0708"/></p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="built_into_the_motherboard"/>Built into the Motherboard</h1></div></div></div><p>Every modern wired Ethernet interface has an eight-pin socket (an <span class="emphasis"><em>Ethernet port</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>jack</em></span>) that mates with the plug on an Ethernet cable. Both the plug and the socket follow a standard called <span class="emphasis"><em>RJ-45</em></span> that specifies the size and shape of the connectors and the signals that move through each of the eight pins (<span class="emphasis"><em>RJ</em></span> stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>Registered Jack</em></span>). RJ-45 connectors are similar to the six-pin RJ-11 plugs and sockets used on telephones, but the RJ-45 is slightly larger to allow for the additional pins. <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#an_rj-45_data_plug_open_parenthesis" title="Figure 7-1. An RJ-45 data plug (left) has eight wires; an RJ-11 telephone plug (right) has four or six wires.">Figure 7-1</a> shows both an RJ-45 Ethernet plug and an RJ-11 telephone plug.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0709"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0710"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0711"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0712"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0713"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0714"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0715"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0716"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0717"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="an_rj-45_data_plug_open_parenthesis"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e5776"/><img alt="An RJ-45 data plug (left) has eight wires; an RJ-11 telephone plug (right) has four or six wires." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266268.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 7-1. An RJ-45 data plug (left) has eight wires; an RJ-11 telephone plug (right) has four or six wires.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>In addition to the port itself, an Ethernet interface also includes some internal hardware that converts the data in both directions between the format that the computer's central processor can handle and the format used by the network. This hardware can take several forms. It can be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>On the computer's main circuit board (the motherboard)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A printed circuit card that mounts inside the computer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A PC card that plugs into a laptop computer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An external unit connected to the computer through a USB cable<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0718"/></p></li></ul></div><p>Almost all the computers built within the past few years have built-in Ethernet ports. On desktop and tower computers, the RJ-45 jack is on the back of the case, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#most_new_computers_come_with_ethernet_p" title="Figure 7-2. Most new computers come with Ethernet ports as standard features.">Figure 7-2</a>.

If your computer came with the operating system already installed, the driver is already in place. However, if you assemble your own computer from parts, you might have to install the network driver supplied with the motherboard or a third party after you load the Windows, Linux, or Unix operating system.</p><div class="figure"><a id="most_new_computers_come_with_ethernet_p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e5820"/><img alt="Most new computers come with Ethernet ports as standard features." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266270.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 7-2. Most new computers come with Ethernet ports as standard features.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="setting_the_bios_utility"/>Setting the BIOS Utility</h2></div></div></div><p>If your computer has a built-in Ethernet interface, it's sometimes necessary to turn off that interface and use a network adapter on an expansion card or some other kind of external network interface. This might happen when you want to use a faster network than your built-in adapter can handle (such as a Gigabit Ethernet network) or if the onboard network controller doesn't work correctly.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0724"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0725"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0721"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0722"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0723"/></p><p>To turn off the internal network interface, you must open the computer's BIOS settings utility and find the option that enables or disables the onboard LAN controller or some other option with a similar name. In most BIOS utilities, the LAN option is buried under two or three menu levels.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0726"/></p><p>The BIOS settings utility is a set of controls that load configuration settings when you turn on the computer. These settings are an essential part of the computer's startup sequence because they tell the computer where and how to find the operating system. To run the BIOS settings utility, turn off the computer, then turn it on again and immediately press the <span class="keycap"><strong>del</strong></span> (delete) or F1 key (depending on the type of BIOS your computer uses).</p><p>If you're not comfortable changing the BIOS settings, just leave them alone. When you install another network interface, Windows and other operating systems will recognize both the internal and external adapters. In most cases, it won't matter if both of them are active at the same time.</p><p>On the other hand, if your network connection doesn't work when you turn on the computer but the rest of the network is okay and all the network cables are plugged into their appropriate sockets, it's possible that the internal adapter has been disabled by accident. This should never happen unless somebody goes into the BIOS utility and changes the setting, but it's possible, especially if the computer is in a public location where other people can mess with it.</p></div></div></div>

On an expansion card, the lights are usually on the metal mounting bracket just above or below the RJ-45 connector; on a PC card, they might be on the card itself, or on the socket that connects to the network cable. Indicator lights on a built-in Ethernet socket are usually right next to the socket itself.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0750"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0751"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0752"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0753"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0754"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0755"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0756"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0757"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0758"/></p><p>The three indicator lights are:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0759"/></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>LINK</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Lights in green when the adapter is connected to a live network</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>10/100</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Lights in yellow when the adapter is connected to a 100 Mbps network; goes dark when it's connected to a 10 Mbps network</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>ACT</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Flashes in green as data passes through the network connection in either direction</p></dd></dl></div><p>These lights are useful for troubleshooting and watching network performance, because they can tell you whether your network connection is working properly. For example, when the LINK indicator lights, you know that the computer is connected to a live network; when it's dark, the network connection is offline. When the ACT light flashes, it tells you that the computer is sending or receiving data.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0760"/></p><p>Unfortunately, the lights are often located in a place where it's difficult or impossible to see them while you're using the computer. When you're testing the system, it's often helpful to ask someone else to watch the lights while you operate the computer.</p><p>On some computers, the LINK and 10/100 lights might remain on when the computer is turned off. This happens when the computer's BIOS has a "wake on LAN" feature that turns on the computer if the adapter receives an incoming signal. Even if this feature is disabled, the computer keeps the network port alive whenever the power supply is turned on. The only way to disable the network adapter completely is to either unplug the AC power or turn off the power switch on the back of the power supply.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-7-0761"/></p></div></body></html>
