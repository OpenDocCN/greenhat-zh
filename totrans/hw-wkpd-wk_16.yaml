    at all, rather than just reading it, then you have to accept that site policies
    apply to you too. Policies determine what types of articles are acceptable, what
    styles of writing are appropriate, and generally how editors should behave.

    do virtually all the work. The response to complaining is likely to be "so fix
    it." This is enshrined in a template that can be used to answer complaints about
    content or other problems. The `{{sofixit}}` template starts off, *Thank you for
    your suggestion. When you feel an article needs improvement, please feel free

    some problem users, but most users don't cause problems at all. *Assume Good Faith*
    (often abbreviated as *AGF*) is a key part of understanding how to deal with others
    on the site. Assume Good Faith was introduced in [Chapter 12](hw-wkpd-wk_15.html
    "Chapter 12. Community and Communication") as an aspiration. But Assume Good Faith
    is also a basic guideline because it helps preserve Wikipedia's good working environment.
    Wikipedia's culture is to assume that mistakes are generally good-faith errors.
    The Internet has become a place where people are often assumed to bring their
    own agenda to any discussion. Wikipedia cannot change this assumption directly,
    but Assume Good Faith helps reduce the tendency to suspect others' motives. In
    other words, leave your baggage at the door! Assuming good faith is a choice *you*
    make that reduces friction.

    pages *before* jumping to conclusions about their motives.

    a difficult editor when the evidence shows that he or she is not acting in good
    faith. By and large, however, most people edit Wikipedia because they want to
    contribute and help. Believing that is best—until you have firm evidence otherwise.
    Most likely, this is how you would want to be treated in an unfamiliar place;
    dispute resolution is not for vague suspicions.

    is made between *official policy* and *guidelines*. Similar to the familiar distinction
    between what is *mandatory* (regulations you are required to follow) and what
    is only *advisory*, policies are meant to be followed by all contributors in their
    work on the site, whereas guidelines are like a manual of standard practices.
    Policies and guidelines are sometimes first developed in *essays*, which are position
    papers posted on the site by an individual editor in his or her user space or
    the Wikipedia namespace for others to work on; though many essays are quite popular
    and are often cited in discussions, they typically do not have the same level
    of consensus as policies and guidelines and are not mandatory.'

    clear status and generally represent more fundamental principles that have broad
    consensus among editors. Guidelines should at least have wide consensus, though,

    the expression of some reasonable expectation of how editors should act under
    normal conditions. The drafting of the policy reflects this: The main thrust of
    a policy is to convey one idea, and this idea should make good sense to someone
    familiar with the site. For instance, the ordinary editor doesn''t need to read
    the fine print on the policy page outlining the value of consensus. But administrators

    point for a new policy may be a new project page in the Wikipedia namespace or
    possibly an essay that makes sense to other editors and begins to be referenced
    in discussions. Policies and guidelines, like other content on Wikipedia, are
    then developed over time by interested editors through a consensus-based process.
    Policies and guidelines are typically altered to reflect changing practice on
    the site or to solve a problem that has arisen. If consensus for a new proposed
    policy can't be reached, the proposal will be dropped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for some weeks without being removed and discussion seems to support the change,
    the new or amended policy has been widely accepted. The expectation is then that
    all editors will begin to follow the new policy when someone points it out. Keeping
    informed about changing policies and guidelines is a real issue for editors; beyond
    the core content and behavioral policies, many editors may not know about all
    the policies and guidelines. This is where Assume Good Faith applies: If User:Alice
    sees that User:Bob isn''t following a new guideline, Alice should let Bob know
    that the guideline changed last month rather than scold him.'

    namespace. The fact that policy pages are editable is one of the radical, counterintuitive
    Wikipedia concepts. Minor changes to policy formulations can occur at any time
    if the community agrees the changes are needed; major changes and new policies
    are also slowly developed to meet new needs and changing circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the practical process for changing policy is not so simple as just
    making an edit. Policies can and do change; however, the process is often very
    slow. On pages in the Wikipedia Talk namespace discussions are always ongoing,
    proposing and criticizing changes to policy. Most policy page changes are reverted
    if they are substantive and have not been discussed previously on the attached
    talk page and perhaps on other community forums. Always seek a high level of consensus
    before making a change to a key policy page. Given a policy's role in regulating

    by the editors interested in disambiguation pages; for other contributors not
    involved in the discussion who may happen to work in this area, the guideline
    now provides more detailed information that they should reasonably follow in most
    cases. If a future contributor comes along and has a serious problem with this

    on the policy's talk page and on other forums. Changes to these policies may be
    difficult to make unless very compelling reasons are given. This difficulty does
    not necessarily reflect the proposal's validity, but simply how difficult getting
    consensus is among the very wide group of editors—potentially, the entire community—who

    your ideas first before proposing a big policy change. Essays are also a useful

- en: '**Conflict of Interest**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This guideline, at [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]], matters because Wikipedia
    articles should not be hijacked by outside interests. Editors acting for corporations
    or religious groups are not welcome to edit articles about those companies or
    groups in such a way as to control the content. No article should be marred by
    long edit wars involving partisan editors with a definite stake in the topic.
    The COI guideline is relatively new but has become important because many people
    would like to exploit Wikipedia's pages. The guideline says simply that editors
    of Wikipedia should not put their outside interests ahead of those of the encyclopedia.
    The best way to ensure that is to edit as little as possible in areas too close
    to your own interests. That includes self-promotion, ensuring favorable coverage
    of a company that has hired you, and certain types of activism. The guideline
    is not intended to prevent academics from editing in their field, members of major
    political parties from editing about related political affairs, or believers editing
    about their religion, as long as these edits respect the Neutral Point of View
    policy.

    all sources cited must certainly be published, so an unpublished conversation
    or email—what academics call a *private communication*—should not be used as a
    source. Second, published work has limitations: A self-published book is not a
    reliable source for factual information in general. Furthermore, websites vary
    widely in reliability. For the most part, blogs are not acceptable sources. Content
    on other wikis cannot be taken as authoritative. Online copies of newspaper articles
    are as good as the hard copy, but newspapers are reliable sources only if they
    are part of the mainstream press. In practice, high standards of source reliability
    have to be met if you want to write about controversial matters or (particularly)
    about living people.'

- en: Wikipedia's policies have evolved from being simple principles to being a large
    group of pages. You can probably count the ones on the site that matter most in
    daily life on the fingers of two hands. Understanding the basic point of a given
    policy or guideline, as it affects you, and in combination with Wikipedia's customs,
    is more important than worrying about the details or how others should comply.
    Bring policy into arguments only when you have to, and if you become involved
    in developing or modifying policy pages, make sure you can take the lead in getting
    consensus among the community.
