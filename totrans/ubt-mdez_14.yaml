- en: And now we come to the audio side of things. Yes, Linux does indeed rock, and
    in this chapter you will find out about the musical talents that your system possesses
    and how it can work with the musical talents that you possess. You will learn
    how to rip CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files (files that you can recognize
    by their *.mp3* and *.ogg* filename extensions), add album cover art, change file
    tags, play music files, and burn files onto audio CDs that you can play in any
    CD player. You’ll also learn about a number of applications that can help the
    musician within you. If you’re interested in learning how to work with your iPod,
    iPhone, iPad, or other digital media device, or how to convert audio files from
    one format to another, however, you’ll have to wait until [Chapter 15](ch15.html
    "Chapter 15. Pluggin’ In the Penguin").

- en: Before we go any further, it’s probably best to discuss the various formats
    in which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the
    de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the .wav
    extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the *.au* extension), and AIFF (from Apple
    and using the *.aiff* extension), all of which are uncompressed formats. Files
    saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly large, with an average WAV
    file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB per minute. To put that in
    perspective, back in 1988 my first Macintosh had a 40MB hard disk—more space than
    I thought I would ever need but not enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s
    “Come as You Are.”
  prefs: []

- en: As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they are
    today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about those
    disk space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus developed.
    These compression formats work, to oversimplify things a bit, by cutting out the
    portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear—sort of a dog-whistle
    approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio compression formats
    is *MP3*. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth
    the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another audio compression format is *Ogg Vorbis*. Ogg Vorbis is a product of
    the open source community, so, unlike MP3, which has always been used under the
    shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, it was free of patent and licensing
    worries from the get-go. Because of that and the fact that it was the equal of
    MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not, as many claim, better), Ogg Vorbis
    became the darling of the Linux community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you rip audio files in this chapter, you are sure to notice yet another encoding
    option—FLAC. *Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)* is an encoding format that, unlike
    the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats, does not remove any audio information from the
    audio file during the encoding process. The downside is that FLAC provides space
    savings of only 30 to 50 percent, much less than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved
    by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. The upside, of course, is that the FLAC files should be
    equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC is an ideal choice if you are not
    satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 files. It’s also
    a good choice if you want to create both Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files . . . or if
    you just don’t know which one you want to work with yet. In such cases, you can
    go ahead and encode it in FLAC format. As I mentioned earlier, once you get to
    [Chapter 15](ch15.html "Chapter 15. Pluggin’ In the Penguin"), you will learn
    how you can convert the FLAC file later, when you know what you want or need.

- en: All that talk about Ogg Vorbis and FLAC aside, many people still like or need
    to deal with MP3 files. You may, for example, already have numerous MP3 files
    ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy listening to one of the many
    Internet radio streams that are broadcast in MP3 format. Unfortunately, MP3 playback
    and encoding support is not included in Ubuntu because of licensing concerns.
    Even if you plan on using the Ogg Vorbis format in your future ripping and encoding
    endeavors, installing MP3 support is a good idea so as to cover all your audio
    bases. It’s also a very easy process. In fact, if you opted to install third-party
    software support when you originally installed Ubuntu, you most likely already
    have all the support files you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you did not opt to install third party software when you first installed
    Ubuntu, then the easiest way to install MP3 playback support is to double-click
    an MP3 file that you have on your hard disk. A window will appear, asking whether
    you want to search for the plug-ins necessary to play the file. Click **Search**,
    after which another window will appear showing you what you need to install ([Figure 14-1](ch14.html#ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n
    "Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.")). Check both boxes
    in that window, click the **Install** button, and in the confirmation window that
    appears, click **Confirm**. You will be asked for your password, so provide it
    and then just wait until the process is complete. Once done, you’ll be able to
    play not only your MP3 audio files but also a variety of other audio and even
    video formats.

    lists of available streams from a variety of sources, which you can then easily
    browse. When you find something you like, just double-click the stream (or just
    select the stream and then click the green play button at the top left of the
    window), and the stream will open in the player of your choice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default player for most streams is Audacious, but that app does not come
    with Ubuntu (though it is available for download from the Ubuntu Software Center),
    so you’ll have to pick an alternative. You can make this choice the very first
    time you run Streamtuner2, since the first window you’ll see is the settings window.
    In that window, change the default entries from Audacious to whatever audio player
    you prefer. The name of the player is usually represented by the name of the application
    in all lowercase letters.

    in [Chapter 16](ch16.html "Chapter 16. Couch Penguins"), not only plays movies
    but also does nicely with audio. In this case, I change all the entries of `audacious`
    to **`totem`**, which is the project name of Movie Player. (I leave the entries
    for VLC as is. You’ll be learning about this useful application in [Chapter 16](ch16.html
    "Chapter 16. Couch Penguins").)

    installed it, **`chrome`**. Your window should then look something like [Figure 14-11](ch14.html#changing_settings_in_streamtuner2
    "Figure 14-11. Changing settings in Streamtuner2"). Once done, click Save. If
    you want to change your settings again in the future, you can access this window
    by going to the **Edit** menu and selecting **Properties**.

    even those you aren’t listening to) and save them as MP3 files. Streamtuner2 is
    set up to do this though a background app called Streamripper, which you have
    to install separately. (Just search for it in the Ubuntu Software Center and install
    normally.) Once it’s installed, you can record a stream from within Streamtuner2
    by right-clicking the target stream and then clicking the red record button at
    the top of the window.

    "Figure 14-13. Audio recording and editing with Audacity")) is the king, in terms
    of numbers of users, of the sound-recording and editing apps, not only in the
    Linux world but to a large degree in the Mac and Windows worlds as well. Audacity
    allows you to record sound files and then edit them, raising pitch, increasing
    and decreasing speed, adding echo and other effects, and . . . well, all sorts
    of other neat stuff. You will probably find yourself using Audacity for more than
    you ever imagined.

    a Linux digital audio workstation")) and LMMS are the two most commonly used Linux
    digital audio workstations, both in the genre of the popular professional digital
    audio workstation, Avid Pro Tools. Digital audio workstations are basically virtual
    mixing rooms, allowing you to record, edit, and play back music. They also allow
    you to create music from within the program itself. I’m no expert with this type
    of application, but many people say that LMMS is stronger in the creation department
    while Ardour is stronger in the recording/editing area. Of course, the easiest
    way to figure out which one is best for your needs is to try them both out.

    and very capable music notation program MuseScore. MuseScore ([Figure 14-15](ch14.html#putting_notes_on_paper_with_musescore
    "Figure 14-15. Putting notes on paper with MuseScore")) allows you to create sheet
    music, by either mouse, keyboard, or midi device, with up to four voices per staff.
    It also allows you to play back the compositions you’ve put on the page. This
    is a great feature for folks like me who can’t read music but find themselves
    wanting to figure out a melody based on its score. Just copy the notes to a page
    in MuseScore, click the play button, and the elusive melody is there before your
    ears (as well as your eyes).

- en: The guitar players among you, particularly those of you with Fender Mustang
    amplifiers (I-IV), will be disappointed to learn that Fender’s Fuse software that
    normally comes with your amp is not compatible with Linux. The good news is an
    answer in the form of the application PLUG ([Figure 14-16](ch14.html#editing_and_creating_mustang_amplifier_p
    "Figure 14-16. Editing and creating Mustang amplifier presets with PLUG")). Like
    Fuse, PLUG can be used to create and edit amplifier presets and upload them to
    your amplifier. Using PLUG is like creating and modifying your own pedal, just
    virtually rather than on the floor in front of you. You can also apply firmware
    updates for your amplifier via PLUG.

    as a precompiled binary that works just fine. Get PLUG from the project website
    at [http://piorekf.org/plug/download/](http://piorekf.org/plug/download/) and
    download the Generic package for 32-bit systems. This is a binary tarball, so
    you won’t be installing it but rather extracting and running it from your Home
    folder, as you did with some of the apps you worked with in [Chapter 8](ch08.html
    "Chapter 8. Simple Kitten Ways"). Once the tarball is downloaded, extract it to
    the *LocalApps* folder you created in [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Simple
    Kitten Ways") (or wherever else you prefer). To run it, double-click the PLUG
    file within the folder it came in and then click **RUN** in the dialog that appears.

    get around the fact that Ubuntu allows only root users to access unknown USB devices,
    which your amp will be. The instructions on how to do this can be found in the
    *README* file in the *PLUG* folder.

    for Linux. It aims to provide, as the project page puts it, “professional yet
