    making music, creating art, and playing games, at some point or another almost
    every one of us has to sit down in front of our machine and get some work done.

    since there are so many applications freely available for you to try, you might
    find that you actually end up using far more office-related productivity apps
    than you would if you had to pay for everything up front. In this chapter, I’ll

    apps they use most often—a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation editor.
    The de facto standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available
    in both the Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, because it is a Microsoft
    product, you can be relatively sure that no Linux version is (or ever will be)
    available.

    with Ubuntu. The suite is called LibreOffice, and it is the open source community-supported
    descendant of OpenOffice.org, the office suite originally bundled with most Linux
    distros until it was taken over and later jettisoned by Oracle (a bit of recent
    history there in case you wondered). LibreOffice is not some lightweight sour-grapes
    substitute for the Microsoft Office-less Linux world; it is a full-featured contender.
    LibreOffice, incidentally, is also freely available (as in *free*) in Windows
    and Mac OS X versions.

    (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation creator and player (Impress), and
    a very handy vector-drawing program (Draw). You can find all of these by going
    to the Dash, clicking the Applications lens, and then clicking the **Office**
    filter button. A database module (Base) is also available for LibreOffice as a
    separate download via Ubuntu Software Center (just search for *base*).

    LibreOffice Help system (**Help** ▸ **LibreOffice Help**) and online at [http://libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/](http://libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/).

    majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, LibreOffice Writer is a good
    one (see [Figure 12-1](ch12.html#libreoffice_writer "Figure 12-1. LibreOffice
    Writer")). It is chock-full of features and can read and save Microsoft Word files.
    Like Word, it will even let you save your documents as HTML files so that you
    can easily change your documents into web pages. In terms of usage, Writer is
    a very straightforward word processor, so I won’t go into any more detail here.
    Again, check out LibreOffice Help or the online documentation mentioned in the
    previous section if you require more information.

    take up your time here with any sort of primer about using Calc. However, because
    many others don’t see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will mention
    a few of the simpler tasks that can be done with Calc in the hope of enticing
    some of you into trying it.
  id: totrans-21

- en: Many people who don’t use spreadsheets think of them as giant calculators used
    for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, such as payrolls. That view
    is not incorrect, of course, since that was the original purpose of such applications,
    but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too. Projecting household budgets,
    calculating grade point averages (by teachers or students), figuring out how long
    it will take you to save up for your trip to San Marino, or even tracking prices
    for the four or five guitars you are trying to choose among . . . these are all
    tasks that spreadsheets are made for. What’s even nicer is that when doing any
    of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs to make abstract
    numbers show themselves to you visually.

    of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, and address
    lists. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order, sort them
    by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to find a use for Calc,
    so don’t ignore it entirely.

    Draw isn’t great for creating true graphics in the artistic sense, it is very
    useful for creating flowcharts; organizational diagrams (such as seating arrangements
    for wedding receptions or conferences); or any other document in which you want
    a bit more control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the
    two are combined), such as fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this

    files within LibreOffice for use in earlier versions of Microsoft Office, however,
    you must save them into the appropriate format. Otherwise, LibreOffice will by
    default save files into its native format (*.odt* for Writer documents, *.ods*
    for Calc documents, and *.odp* for Impress documents), and only the most recent
    versions of Microsoft Office can deal with these files.

    files are pretty good, too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just
    like tool tips in the Windows and Mac worlds. (In case you aren’t sure what I’m
    talking about, *tool tips* are those little boxes that pop up to tell you what
    a button or menu item does when you place your mouse over that button or menu
    item.) Another cool and useful help feature is What’s This, which works like the
    Tips system but provides more detailed explanations of what a particular button
    does. If you select **Help** ▸ **What’s This**, your cursor will turn into a little
    question mark. Move that question mark cursor over almost any item in the LibreOffice
    interface, and you’ll find out what it does rather than just what the item is
    called.

    you’ve been writing. You thus need to drop all of the headings you had before
    down a notch, with the former main heading becoming a subheading and so on. When
    you double-click the word *Headings*, the text of all the headings you have listed
    in the document appears. You can then select a heading in that list and click
    the Demote Level button (that’s the one at the far right of the second row of

    number of other applications are available from the Ubuntu Software Center that
    can be grouped together under the “productivity” label. I will introduce a few
    of those to you here.

    Dlume ([Figure 12-11](ch12.html#dlume_address_book_application "Figure 12-11. Dlume
    address book application")). Dlume is a simple standalone address book application
    that feels light and easy to use. It allows you to easily search for names in
    your address book and to export all your information in CSV or HTML formats. You
    can run Dlume from the Dash by clicking the Applications lens and then clicking
    the **Accessories** filter button, or just type the name in the search box and
    press enter.

    "Figure 12-12. gLabels")), which I’ve used from my very earliest days as a Linux
    user. As the name suggests, gLabels is an application for laying out and printing
    various types of labels; although the name does not suggest it, gLabels is also
    great for making business cards. It includes templates for most, if not all, of
    the label and card stock out there from Avery and a few other manufacturers. While
    it’s true that you can do most of what gLabels does in LibreOffice or Scribus
    (which I will mention later in this chapter), I’m sure you will find gLabels to
    be the easiest and most intuitive way to get the job done, especially when it
    comes to setting up cards or labels with graphics or special layouts.

    run most GNOME panel applets anymore . . . well, not easily anyway. Sticky Notes,
    the app that allowed you to post little yellow Post-it-like notes on the desktop,
    is one such app. Fortunately, the more full-featured answer to Sticky Notes, called
    Tomboy ([Figure 12-13](ch12.html#desktop_notes_with_some_oomphmtomboy "Figure 12-13. Desktop
    notes with some oomph—Tomboy")), does work in Unity. Once installed and launched,
    Tomboy works as a panel applet, positioning itself with the other status indicator
    icons at the right side of the Unity top panel. From that Tomboy menu, you can
    add and edit notes and control other Tomboy functions.

    These allow you to search for entries within your entire Tomboy note library and
    create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to another linked note. In fact,
    Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink whenever you type a word that matches
    one of your existing note headings. To make matters even more exciting (or at
    least more useful), Tomboy, by means of its plug-ins feature, allows you to export
    notes to HTML or print them, either as hard copy or as PDFs.

    application FreeMind ([Figure 12-14](ch12.html#freemind-id1 "Figure 12-14. Freemind"))
    might be perfect for you. FreeMind allows you to lay out your ideas graphically
    and save your results in a number of formats, including PDF, PNG, JPEG, and SVG.
    You can download FreeMind from the Ubuntu Software Center and then run it from
    the Dash. Just click the Applications lens and then the **Office** filter button.

    Scribus ([Figure 12-15](ch12.html#scribus-id1 "Figure 12-15. Scribus")) for those
    times when LibreOffice Writer and Draw just don’t cut it. Scribus is designed
    to produce commercial-grade output, and it supports professional publishing features,
    such as CMYK colors, PostScript handling, and creation of color separations, to
    name but a few. There is a fairly good support network out there for Scribus and
    an online tutorial too ([http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus](http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus)),
    so you won’t be alone if you find yourself getting into this application.

    Scribus"))，这是在LibreOffice Writer和Draw无法满足需求时使用的。Scribus旨在生成商业级输出，并支持专业出版功能，例如CMYK颜色、PostScript处理以及创建颜色分离等，仅举几例。Scribus有一个相当不错的支持网络，还有一个在线教程([http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus](http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Get_Started_with_Scribus))，所以如果你发现自己开始使用这个应用，你不会孤单。
