<i class="calibre11">Installing Programs with RPM</i>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Well, now that you know what RPM isn’t,  you are no doubt wondering what it is. <i class="calibre11">RPM </i>stands for Red Hat Package Manager, and it is  a very handy system that Red Hat came up with to allow  users to install and remove packages easily. Of course, at  this point you may be wondering what a package is. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">At the most basic level, a <i class="calibre11">package</i> is simply an archived file or an archived  collection of files, like the ZIP (.zip) or StuffIt (.sit) files you may already know.  Packages designed to be used with the RPM system, however, are slightly different.  Such packages are usually called RPM packages, RPM files, or just RPMs, and they  are easily recognizable by the .rpm extension at the end of the filename. An RPM  package consists of an archived file or set of files, along with a set of installation  instructions telling the system’s package manager where in the system to install  the package files. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Usually these RPM packages are applications, though they could be other  things too, such as fonts or documents. The Package Manager automatically  installs each of the components that are in the package in the proper place on  your system, making it all very easy on you. All in all, using RPM is very similar to  installing Windows programs with an installer.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fedora (and its Red Hat Linux predecessors) is not, of course, the only  distribution that is RPM based — other distributions, most notably Mandrake  and SuSE, are also RPM based. However, because different distros place various  system files in different places, and because they are compiled differently, RPM  packages are often distro specific. Thus, an RPM package for any popular  application will most likely come in many different flavors, so to speak, to go with  the various Linux distros. As if that weren’t enough, there may also be different  RPM packages for the different versions of a particular distro. For example, in  the case of Red Hat Linux, you may find RPMs specifically designed for versions7.3, 8, 9, and so on. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you will come to notice, RPM filenames also specify a CPU architecture  before the .rpm extension. You will thus see RPM files ending with <i class="calibre11">i386.rpm</i> (386 class CPU or better), <i class="calibre11">i586.rpm</i> (Pentium class CPU or better), <i class="calibre11">i686.rpm </i>(Pentium  II class CPU or better), and even <i class="calibre11">ppc.rpm </i>(Motorola/IBM Power PC CPU, as used  in modern Macintosh computers). Those packages labeled <i class="calibre11">noarch.rpm </i>(no  architecture) can be used with any CPU. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If all that information I just gave you about RPMs seems a bit much, don’t worry.  Installing RPM packages is quite an easy task. Usually, you can install an RPM  package simply by double-clicking the RPM package file. In this project, you will  get a chance to install four RPM packages in this manner.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Let’s start out this project by installing a simple little sliding-tile puzzle game  called Skoosh (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU85">Figure 8-1</a>). Skoosh is not included with Fedora Core, so you will  have to download it yourself. You can do this by going to <a target="_top" href="http://dag.wieers.com/">http://dag.wieers.com/</a> packages/skoosh. Once there, download the most recent file appropriate for the  version of Linux you are running (e.g., <i class="calibre11">rh90 for Red Hat Linux 9.0</i> or <i class="calibre11">rhfc1</i> for  Fedora Core 1, and so on) by simply clicking on the file name. The Skoosh file  only weighs in at about 150KB, so the entire download process should be over  very quickly.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the Skoosh RPM file is on your hard disk, you are ready to install it. To  do this, just double-click the Skoosh file. You will then be prompted for your root  password, so type that in and click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. A completed System Preparation window  will then appear, telling you how many packages will be installed and how much  disk space will be used when the installation is completed (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU86">Figure 8-2</a>). To continue, click <b class="calibre13">Continue</b>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">So far everything has been quite easy. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case;  sometimes you will find that the RPM package you are trying to install contains  system dependencies that your system is not set up to handle. To illustrate this  point, let’s look at the Frozen-Bubble game.<a name="354" id="354"/><a name="IDX-113" id="IDX-113"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Frozen-Bubble (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU87">Figure 8-3</a>) started out as a standard game in the  Mandrake Linux distribution, but because of its popularity it made its way to  SuSE and even Windows. It is a pleasant game with cool graphics and music. It  is also very attractive, in that you just can’t lose. Unlike other arcade-style games,  Frozen-Bubble lets you do a game level over and over and over and over until  you get it right. </p>

<span><span>Figure 8-3: </span> Playing Frozen-Bubble</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Frozen-Bubble and Perl-SDL can both be downloaded from <a target="_top" href="http://freshrpms">http://freshrpms.</a> net/packages. When you go to that page, locate and click the link for the version  of Linux you are using. Once on the package page, look at the list on the left of  the page and click the <b class="calibre13">frozen-bubble</b> link. This will bring you to the download  page. To download the file, right-click the tiny floppy disk icon near the top of  the page, and select <b class="calibre13">Save As</b> in the pop-up menu. Once you’ve done that, look at  the list on the left side of the page again, and download the file perl-SDL using  the same procedure.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Installing the two files is very simple. However, if you install Frozen-Bubble  before Perl-SDL, you will experience what is often referred to as “dependency  hell.” <a name="357" id="357"/><a name="IDX-114" id="IDX-114"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To see what I mean (don’t worry, nothing bad will happen), double-click the  Frozen-Bubble RPM file, and the Package Manager will do its usual dependency  search. In this case, it will find that your system is lacking the Perl-SDL package,  and it throws up a window telling you so (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU88">Figure 8-4</a>). In order to get around this problem, close the warning window by clicking <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and then just double- click the Perl-SDL file and install it. Once Perl-SDL is installed, go on and install  Frozen-Bubble in the same manner.</p>

<span><span>Figure 8-4: </span> The Package Not Found warning window</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the case of Frozen-Bubble, there is only one extra file needed, but sometimes  there are more. Worse yet, sometimes some of those required files that you  download and try to install have dependencies of their own — the truly hellish  scenario. Of course, as these dependency files might be required by other RPM packages you try to install in the future, you may well find that this dependency  problem will gradually lessen for you over time.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have installed the two files, you can play Frozen-Bubble by going to the  Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Games </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More Games </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Frozen Bubble</b>. That’s all  there is to it; unless you end up playing the game until the middle of the night (and coming in to work late as a result), you will be more than pleased with the  results of this project.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I should mention here that you cannot use your mouse in Frozen-Bubble.  Once the game starts, you can begin playing a game by pressing ENTER. After  that, use the left and right cursor keys to aim your ball, and then use the up  cursor key to shoot it. To quit the game, press the ESC key once, which will  bring you to the high scores window where you can input your initials. Once you  are done with that, press ENTER (or press the ESC key again to skip over it), which will bring you back to the opening screen. Finally, hit ESC again, and the game  will close.</p>

This means that installing additional packages from your installation CDs is a very simple process.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are using Fedora Core 1, there is a small matter that you must first attend  to before you can try your hand at installing packages via the Package  Management window. You see, the Fedora Core 1 Package Manager has a bug  that prohibits you from reading data on the installation disks it asks you to insert.  Fortunately, this is easily remedied by installing a single RPM update file. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get the file, go to <a target="_top" href="http://ayo.freshrpms.net/fedora/linux/1/i386/">http://ayo.freshrpms.net/fedora/linux/1/i386/</a> RPMS.updates, and download <b class="calibre13">redhat-config-packages-1.2.7-1.noarch.rpm</b>.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have fixed the bug, you can have a go with the Package  Management window. The two packages we are going to try installing are  Epiphany (an alternative GNOME Web browser that is sort of a light version  of Mozilla) and the home finance software package GnuCash. <a name="365" id="365"/><a name="IDX-116" id="IDX-116"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Epiphany (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU90">Figure 8-6</a>) made its debut in Fedora Core, and thus is  not present on the Red Hat Linux 9 installation disks. In many ways, it is very  similar to Mozilla, as it is based on the same rendering engine. Unlike Mozilla, however, Epiphany is designed to be integrated into the GNOME desktop  environment and to follow GNOME’s interface features. This is good news for  customization freaks, as any customization features you apply to GNOME will  also take effect in Epiphany. </p>
