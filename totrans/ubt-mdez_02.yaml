- en: As I have already mentioned, one of the great things about Ubuntu is that it
    comes on a live CD, which means that you can try it before you install it . .
    . or never install it at all, if that’s what you prefer. Better yet is the fact
    that, unlike earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don’t need an additional installation
    CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu CD functions as both a live CD and
    an installation disc. And in the good-better-best swing of things, the best point
    of all is that installation from the live CD is actually much, much easier than
    any other installation process you’ve ever dealt with, and it even gives you more
    than one way to go about it.

    the live CD and then, assuming you’ve caught the Linux bug, the painless steps
    of installing Ubuntu on your hard disk as your operating system, either in its
    own partition on your hard disk in a traditional dual-boot setup (with Windows
    in its own partition) or, for the slightly less adventurous, from within your
    Windows system.

    Take a look at [Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. Installing Ubuntu from a USB
    Flash Drive") to see how you can run or install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive
    instead. Whatever way you end up going about things, let’s put this book to use

    to see whether it’s all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way
    than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the Ubuntu
    CD in your disc drive and restart your machine. When the machine starts up, it
    should boot up from the CD, and after a second or two, you should see a purple
    Ubuntu startup screen with a couple of icons at the bottom of it. If the screen
    does not appear and your machine instead boots up into your usual operating system,
    then very likely your machine’s BIOS settings need to be changed to allow you
    to boot from a CD. Worry not: Although the procedure might sound rather technical,
    altering the BIOS settings isn’t much of a hassle.'

    key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS setup. This
    is usually delete or F1, but F2, F10, F12, and esc are also common—not all machines
    are the same. If the onscreen information passes by so fast that you miss it,
    you can check your user’s manual to see what the correct key is.

    make sure you save your changes and then restart the computer.

    can choose your language and other settings. The default settings should suffice
    for our purposes, so leave the keyboard untouched for a few seconds, and the purple
    screen will give way to a loading screen (also purple).

    give way to a pristine Ubuntu desktop with a row of colorful icons down the left
    side and the same purple background. You should now be able to use your mouse
    as well as the keyboard, so feel free to explore. And remember, your hard disk
    will go untouched, so rest easy—you’re not going to change, let alone hurt, anything.
    When you get to this point, you’re ready to take Ubuntu for a spin—but I’ll hold
    off on talking about that until [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. A New Place

    Once it’s installed, every time you start up your machine, you’ll be able to choose

    Your Windows system stays as it is; you don’t have to partition your hard disk,

    It’s not as robust as a full Ubuntu installation, and it takes longer to install
    because Wubi needs to download the installation files from the Internet (the right
    ones aren’t on the CD). But it is a pretty good compromise—it definitely runs
    quicker and is much, much more usable and enjoyable than an Ubuntu live CD session.
    You also have the added benefit of being able to save files and settings to disk,

    and for them to happily coexist. This is known as a *dual-boot* setup. It has

    setup, though I eventually found that I used the Linux side of things exclusively.
    Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I didn’t use seemed

    has no equivalent on Linux.

    Linux or to boot up in Windows instead. After that, bootup proceeds as normal

    is simply *rg*, but you could use something like *hope4u2pal*, though that would
    get rather tiring to look at. You also need to come up with a user password, which
    you will need to type every time you log in. You will need to use it when you
    install new software or change certain system settings, as well. It should be
    a minimum of eight characters in length and consist of numbers, letters (upper-
    and lowercase), and symbols for improved security. The harder it is for someone
    to guess, the better. You can, of course, get by with fewer characters and only
    letters if you prefer. The installer will advise you if the password you enter
    is unacceptable, so don’t worry about this. Be sure to write it down and keep

    easier than that for Windows or Mac OS X. And keep in mind that with Windows and
    OS X, you are installing the operating system with just a few bundled applications.
    In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, you are installing not only the

    is no need for such concern. As long as you have backed up your data, ideally
    to an external hard disk or similar, you will be okay. If you screw up the installation
    the first time out, so what? Just start over. No harm done, because you have nothing
    to harm—all your files are safe and secure in your backup copy. Just make sure
    that you give yourself more time than you need for the process. Don’t start installing
    an hour before you have to be at work or before you have to meet your friend downtown.
    Rushing makes people do weird things. Make things easy on yourself by giving yourself
    plenty of time and, as I mentioned before, by backing up any data you would mourn

    one big room. If you want to completely remove Windows and install Ubuntu instead,
    Ubuntu can happily take over the entire partition (and thus the entire disk) and
    kick out the former resident, Windows.

    to give each one its own partition (after all, they need their privacy). Back
    with the house analogy, it’s like erecting a partition wall to carve up the house
    into two rooms. If you choose to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, the installer will
    automatically do this partitioning for you. Of course, you can choose how big
    each partition is: The bigger you make the Ubuntu partition, the more disk space
    will be available to you in Ubuntu (and the less in Windows). After all, the house
    is the same size; it’s just the position of the dividing wall that you’re changing.'

    installer will be happy to handle the task for you.

    This is probably the most fun one—you get to choose the name of your computer,
    your username, and a password. Enter your name first, at the top. The installer
    will make suggestions for some of the other fields, but you don’t have to take
    them. For the computer name, choose something short and simple with no spaces.
    Ditto for the username—as I mentioned in [Usernames and User Passwords](ch02.html#usernames_and_user_passwords
    "Usernames and User Passwords") in [Taking the Full Plunge—Installing Ubuntu Outside
    of Windows](ch02.html#taking_the_full_plungeminstalling_ubuntu "Taking the Full

    a mixture of letters, numbers, and symbols.'

    entry box in the way makes it much more difficult for anyone to gain access to
    your computer and all of the precious (and potentially confidential) files stored

    folder** option. This will scramble the contents of your Home folder (where all
    your documents are stored) so that no one can see any of the files in it without
    your password. It won’t affect how you access your files, however, as they are
    descrambled for you when you log in. This is nice to have if you work with confidential
    information, since the data will be pretty safe even if your computer is stolen.

    system on it and you are setting up a dual-boot system, the installer will scan
    your hard disk to try to find certain settings, folders, and documents that it
    can automatically transfer to your new Ubuntu system environment. This step shouldn’t
    really matter, because you (hopefully!) made backup copies of all your important
    documents and settings before you started the installation. Still, it’s more convenient
    than copying everything from that backup onto your new Ubuntu system manually
    after the installation has finished. If a migration window appears, just check
    the boxes next to the items you want to transfer and then click **Continue**.'
