<p class="b24-bookeditorial">We were all novice programmers once. Back then, we would struggle for hours to get the simplest program to compile. But we were young and foolish and made a lot of stupid mistakes. Now we are professional programmers and we don't make dumb mistakes. We make smart ones (but we call them "professional errors").</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One electronic assembly company was having a problem with pilferage. Thousands of electronic parts were just disappearing. The company instituted a lot of new security measures, but the shortages kept continuing. Where could all the parts be going?</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally a janitor solved the mystery. He was up in the rafters changing a light when he came across three birds' nests. The birds had taken parts from the factory floor and used them to make their nests. It was estimated that the nests were valued at $10,000 each.</p>
