- en: At the bottom of your bank checks is a series of numbers that indicates your
    bank and account number. A crook opened an account in New York with $5\. He then
    created his own checks. They where the same as his real checks except that the
    bank number was modified so that it referred to a bank in Los Angeles.

    initial deposit. The check went into the automatic sorting equipment, and the
    computer saw the bank number for Los Angeles and sent the check to L.A. The bank
    in L.A. saw that this check wasn't for it, so it sent the check back to the clearing
    house in New York. It went back in the automatic sorting equipment, the computer
    saw the L.A. bank number, and it's sent back to L.A.

- en: The check was now in an endless cycle going back and forth between New York
    and L.A. While it circled round and round, the crook went to the bank where he
    deposited first the check and asked for all his money. The clerk looked up the
    last deposit, saw that it was two weeks ago, and assumed that the check had cleared.
    After all, it takes only a couple of days for a New York check to get to the proper
    bank. So the clerk gave the crook $10,000, and he disappeared.

    in the automatic sorting equipment. So it was hand sorted and finally given to
    the right bank.
