    or capable of becoming so. This is true of Linux as well. Just open your Web browser
    and you can read, without performing any special installations, pages in any European
    language, including those with Cyrillic alphabets, such as Russian. You can even
    view pages in Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Arabic, and Hebrew, to name but a few,
    with only a tad more effort.

    way that Fedora Core has things set up makes it quite easy to take advantage of
    these capabilities. As you will soon see, you can even set up your system to give
    you a totally foreign language environment, allowing you to function completely
    in the language of your choice. Add to this the ever-expanding number of free
    programs available for language study, and you have a truly meaningful language-learning
    tool.

    have users with different native languages using the same machine. At my university,
    for example, where my Japanese and Chinese students sometimes use my computer,
    the additional language support allows them to log in using their own language.
    All in all, it is a very useful feature.
  prefs: []

    depending on the language you wish to use, it may require little to no special
    installation measures. The rule of thumb is essentially the same as for the read-only
    language support I mentioned earlier — if you want to view your entire system
    in languages with Roman-based writing systems (French, Spanish, Danish, German,
    Malaysian, and so on), then you don’t have to do anything. And once you have installed
    one of the Microsoft TrueType Core Fonts, you are ready for all those languages
    with non-Roman writing systems I mentioned earlier as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Support for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean is another matter. The writing systems
    of these three languages are sufficiently complex as to require not only the installation
    of the appropriate fonts, but also the installation of a fair number of other
    applications to handle the input and conversion processes. Whenever possible,
    it is best to install additional language support for these languages during the
    initial system installation process described in [Chapter 2](DDU0018_split_000.html#42).
    If you have already installed your system without support for these languages,
    but would like to add it without having to reinstall your whole system again,
    check out the Web page for this book ([www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks](http://www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks))

    but I will use it for convenience’s sake. In any case, each language has its own
    IME, and Fedora automatically installs the appropriate IME for each of the languages

    Still, the standard input method for Japanese is primarily via the standard Roman

    Korean is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called *Hangul,* or in
    a combination of *Hangul* and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese called
    *Hanja*. While the *Hanja* are essentially the same as their Chinese and Japanese
    counterparts, *Hanzi* and *Kanji*, the Korean phonetic alphabet, *Hangul,* has
    it own unique appearance, as you can see in the Korean word for Korea, *Hangug(k)*,

    most other languages written with an alphabet, *Hangul* letters are grouped in
    pairs, triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a general rule, clockwise.
    The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually based on a Korean alphabetical
    keyboard layout) while it is being typed and it must adjust the size, spacing,
    and positioning of each letter as it puts them into appropriate clusters (see

    the Kdeedu Contributed Learning Files page at [http://edu.kde.org/contrib/](http://edu.kde.org/contrib/)
    kvtml.php and download whatever you want to your hard drive. I would recommend
    creating a special folder inside your Home folder in which to keep these files.
    You might call the new folder kdeedu_data.

    cards, FlashKard is a more appropriate choice (though it can also use the same
    .kvtml files that KVocTrain uses). To run FlashKard, just go to the Main menu
    and select **Run Program**, and in the Run Program window, type [flashkard](DDU0149.html#927)
    and then click **Run**. FlashKard will then appear, and you can start inputting
    words that you want to study (see [Figure 17-10](#figure.DDU180) on the next page).
    After you have created a vocabulary list, you can quiz yourself, in typical flash
    card fashion, by going to the **Function** menu and selecting **Quiz**.

- en: One of the handiest programs available for language learners, or anyone else
    who needs to function in a multilingual world, is the GNOME dictionary program
    called StarDict (see [Figure 17-11](#figure.DDU181)). It is a straightforward
    dictionary that can provide definitions in a wide variety of languages all at
    once.

- en: Once the program is up and running, it will display definitions from all the
    language dictionaries that you installed when you installed StarDict. This works
    in any direction, so definitions will appear for any word you type, regardless
    of the language. For example, I have the Eng-Swe, Swe-Eng, Ger-Swe, Swe-Jpn, Jpn-Eng,
    Eng-Jpn, Chi-Eng, and Eng-Chi dictionaries all installed. If I type an English
    word, I will get definitions in Swedish, Chinese, and Japanese. If I type a Swedish
    word, I will get definitions in English and Japanese, and so on.

- en: StarDict is also a great utility for reading text in files or Web pages because
    as long as the StarDict program is running, it will display definitions for words
    you select with your mouse in other programs. [Figure 17-12](#figure.DDU182) shows
    this inline function in action in a Web page. This inline function is called *Scan
    Selection*, and it also works when you are typing text into a document, or even
    in dialog boxes within the system itself. If you select a word, StarDict will
    scan it and tell you what it means.

    do not use it. It is not the same.

    files, usually a pair of dictionaries for each language pair (for example, English-German
    and German-English). You can get these by clicking on the **Dictionaries** link
    near the top of the Web page. Once you get to the Dictionaries page, you will
    see some additional links: **dictd-[www.dict.org](http://www.dict.org)**, **dictd[www.freedict.de](http://www.freedict.de)**,
    **dictd-[www.mova.org](http://www.mova.org)**, ***Quick**, **zh_CN**, **zh_TW**,
    and **ja**. The FreeDict link (dictd-[www.freedict.de](http://www.freedict.de))
    should have most of what you want, though you can try them all to see what they
    have. When you do start downloading, download the RPM files, not the tarballs
    — to keep things simple, of course.'

- en: The StarDict program and all the dictionaries for it are in the form of RPM
    files (or at least they should be if you did what I told you to do), so you will
    have no problems installing them. Just start off with the StarDict RPM package
    and double-click it. The rest of the procedure is the same as you learned in [Chapter
    8](DDU0064_split_000.html#345), so you should have no headaches.

- en: Running StarDict is easy. Just go to your Main menu and select **Accessories**
    > **More Accessories** > **StarDict**. StarDict will then start up and place a
    small applet in the GNOME Panel. When you click this applet, it allows you to
    hide and show the main dictionary window. If you right-click it, you can turn
    the Scan Selection function on and off. This is very handy, because as soon as
    StarDict is up and running, it will start popping up definitions any time you
    highlight any item of text anywhere, which could, it seems to me, bring on the
    early onset of some form of dementia.

    site for this book ([www.edgy-penguins.org/LFYM/multilingual.html](http://www.edgy-penguins.org/LFYM/multilingual.html)),
    where I list some other langauge-learning applications I have found and tested
    on Fedora Core. There are already a couple entries for Japanese language-learning
    apps (Gjiten and Kanjipad) as I am writing this, and I am always on the lookout
    for more.
