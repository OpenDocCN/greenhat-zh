    well-defined, and accomplished branch of computer science. Resident experts eagerly
    assert the importance of their area of expertise by pointing to large sets of
    neatly cataloged security flaws, invariably attributed to security-illiterate
    developers, while their fellow theoreticians note how all these problems would
    have been prevented by adhering to this year’s hottest security methodology. A
    commercial industry thrives in the vicinity, offering various nonbinding security
    assurances to everyone, from casual computer users to giant international corporations.

    vulnerability management, malware and attack detection, sandboxing, and so forth)
    and perhaps on selectively pointing out flaws in somebody else’s code. The frustrating,

    decade, Netscape Navigator was on the way out, and Internet Explorer held an impressive
    80 percent market share—a number roughly comparable to what Netscape had held

    certain types of data from disk. For each such assumption, there likely exists

    its rules instead. The exploitability of these issues is greatly aggravated by
    vendors’ desire to get their foot in the door and try to allow web pages to switch
    to their browser on the fly without the user’s informed consent. For example,
    Firefox allows pages to be opened in its browser by registering a *firefoxurl:*

- en: The Web began as a classical example of a proper client-server architecture,
    but the functional boundaries between client and server responsibilities were
    quickly eroded. The culprit is JavaScript, a language that offers the HTTP servers
    a way to delegate application logic to the browser (“client”) side and gives them
    two very compelling reasons to do so. First, such a shift often results in more
    responsive user interfaces, as servers do not need to synchronously participate
    in each tiny UI state change imaginable. Second, server-side CPU and memory requirements
    (and hence service-provisioning costs) can decrease drastically when individual
    workstations across the globe chip in to help with the bulk of the work.

  zh: 互联网最初是一个典型的客户端-服务器架构的例子，但客户端和服务器之间的功能边界很快就被侵蚀了。罪魁祸首是JavaScript，这种语言为HTTP服务器提供了一种将应用程序逻辑委托给浏览器（“客户端”）的方法，并给了它们两个非常有说服力的理由去做这件事。首先，这样的转变通常会导致用户界面更加响应迅速，因为服务器不需要同步参与每个可想象的微小UI状态变化。其次，当全球各地的个人工作站共同分担大量工作时，服务器端的CPU和内存需求（以及因此提供服务的成本）可以大幅降低。
- en: The client-server diffusion process began innocently enough, but it was only
    a matter of time before the first security mechanisms followed to the client side

    server as little more than a dumb storage device and moving almost all the parsing,
    editing, display, and configuration tasks into the browser itself. In such designs,

- en: A simple shift in where the entire application magic happens is not necessarily
    a big deal, but not all security responsibilities can be delegated to the client
    as easily. For example, even in the case of a server acting as dumb storage, clients
    cannot be given indiscriminate access to all the data stored on the server for
    other users, and they cannot be trusted to enforce access controls. In the end,
    because it was not desirable to keep all the application security logic on the
    server side, and it was impossible to migrate it fully to the client, most applications
    ended up occupying some arbitrary middle ground instead, with no easily discernible
    and logical separation of duties between the client and server components. The
    resulting unfamiliar designs and application behaviors simply had no useful equivalents

  zh: 整个应用程序魔法发生位置的简单转变并不一定是件大事，但并非所有的安全责任都可以轻易地委托给客户端。例如，即使是在服务器作为哑存储的情况下，客户端也不能无差别地访问服务器上存储的其他用户的所有数据，也不能信任它们执行访问控制。最终，由于不希望将所有应用程序安全逻辑保留在服务器端，并且完全迁移到客户端又是不可能的，大多数应用程序最终占据了某种任意的中间地带，客户端和服务器组件之间没有明显的和逻辑上的职责分离。由此产生的不熟悉的设计和应用行为在优雅和纯洁的安全角色扮演世界中没有任何有用的对应物。

    isolate smaller functional blocks and make assumptions about their intended operation.
