    beret of yours and address the artistic side of things. Yes, Linux does art, and
    as you will soon find out, a good number of programs on your system allow you
    to create and manipulate graphic files. These days, however, there is perhaps
    nothing so important to most users’ graphical repertoires as their digital cameras,
    so that is where we’ll begin.

    cameras is practically a worry-free affair. In fact, Ubuntu pretty much treats
    your camera as if it were an external hard drive or flash drive plugged into your
    computer’s USB port (which is pretty much what it is). And even if your camera
    doesn’t seem to communicate with your computer when connected directly, you can
    still transfer your images to your hard disk by removing the memory card from
    your camera, inserting it into a USB flash memory card reader, and plugging that
    reader into one of your computer’s USB ports.

    are images that have not been processed by the on-board conversion software in
    your camera that converts the data it receives from the sensor into a format that
    your computer is able to deal with (usually JPEG files). For most people, JPEG
    images work just fine, but many photographers who want to have the best quality
    results after making adjustments to their images on their computers save their
    files in RAW image format, or RAW mode. While not all cameras have the option
    to save files in RAW mode, many advanced amateur and professional camera models
    do.

    RawTherapee comes in (see [Figure 13-11](ch13.html#working_with_raw_images_in_rawtherapee

    files with RawTherapee, you will be able to see what they actually look like and
    then go on to adjust them to your heart’s content, usually with much better results
    than you would get if working on JPEG files. Once you have made your adjustments
    to the RAW files, you can save them into other, more universally compatible file
    formats, such as JPEG, while retaining the original RAW file for future use.

    next to the words *Overwrite existing images* so that you keep your original images

    with a mouse, then MyPaint is for you. MyPaint ([Figure 13-15](ch13.html#mypaint_for_wacom_tablet_artists
    "Figure 13-15. MyPaint for Wacom tablet artists")) is designed to work with pressure-sensitive
    tablets by Wacom and other manufacturers. Despite its simple interface, it features
    a never-ending canvas (so you can keep on draw-ing in all directions until you
    run out of steam), an extensive brush collection, and even a brush-creation and
    editing tool. If you need a bit of help getting started, check out the online
    tutorial ([http://mypaint.intilinux.com/?page_id=3](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/?page_id=3)).

    file formats. In these images, the location and color of every single *pixel*
    is recorded. Thus, the image is essentially a collection of dots. The file you
    create is a rather hefty map of these pixels, and this map tells your system where
    everything in your image is supposed to go when it is displayed or printed.

    actually collections of mathematical formulas representing the various shapes
    in your image. This may sound arcane, and you may be wondering why you should
    care. But such drawings have advantages in certain cases. One advantage is that
    vector image files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another,
    and perhaps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain
    their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as a
    bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges (“the jaggies”) when enlarged
    to any extent, while the same circle in a vector image would remain smooth and
    round no matter how much you increased its size.'

    offering, Inkscape (see [Figure 13-16](ch13.html#inkscape-id1 "Figure 13-16. Inkscape")).
    You can learn how to use Inkscape at the Inkscape home page at [http://www.inkscape.org/](http://www.inkscape.org/).
    Be sure to click the **Galleries** link on that page to see examples of what you
    can create with the program, such as the image shown in [Figure 13-16](ch13.html#inkscape-id1
    "Figure 13-16. Inkscape") from [http://focaclipart.net23.net/transporte/](http://focaclipart.net23.net/transporte/).

    "Figure 13-17. gThumb")), handy for photo-handling chores, came preinstalled.
    Some folks wish it still did. It has almost all the same features as Shotwell
    and a few of its own (such as creating original web album pages and some limited
    batch conversion capabilities). That said, it all boils down to what you like,
    and since both gThumb and Shotwell are free and easy to use, there’s no harm in
    trying them both to see which one you prefer.

    open source applications available today. Blender ([Figure 13-18](ch13.html#blender-id1
    "Figure 13-18. Blender")) is a professional-level 3D modeling, animation, and
    rendering program. It is rather complex, but that’s the source of its power and
    popularity. (It comes in versions for just about every operating system out there.)
    If you would like to find out a bit more about Blender before taking the time
    (and disk space) to install it, go to [http://www.blender.org/](http://www.blender.org/).
