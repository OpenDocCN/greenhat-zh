<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I taught programming for a while. At the time, I didn't know much about teaching and found it hard to gauge how much homework to give the class. One time, I was stopped by the Fort Worth police because my homework was too hard. True story.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I was driving through the streets of Fort Worth and stopped for a red light. A police car pulled up beside me. I looked at the officer. He looked at me for a moment and then motioned for me to roll down my window. I admit I was a little worried. After all, I was driving an unrestored '58 Chevy and the muffler had fallen out three times so far.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I rolled down my window as directed, and he leaned over to me and shouted, "Steve, your homework is too hard this week."</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">That's when I learned that one of my students worked for the Fort Worth Police Department. Needless to say, I gave the class an extra week to turn in their homework.</p>
