    handy when you have to transfer fairly large, but not gigantic, amounts of data

    rectangular connector plugs (see [Figure 12-2](#figure.DDU118)), have become increasing
    popular, largely because you can plug and unplug them while your computer is running
    (called *hot plugging*). While connecting universal serial bus (USB) storage devices
    to USB ports (which are also shown in [Figure 12-2](#figure.DDU118)) is about
    as simple as things can get, accessing those devices so that you can transfer
    data to and from them is still one of Fedora’s weaker areas, but once you go through
    the only slightly cumbersome one-time process of setting up your USB storage device,
    things will be as easy as can be. A little patience will bring great rewards,
    as the pyWings oracle might say.

    device is compatible with your system. In the case of Windows or Macintosh compatibility,
    this is usually quite simply determined by reading the fine print on the side
    of the box that the device comes in. As you no doubt know by now, Linux compatibility
    is seldom specified. There also seems to be little in the way of an online guide
    for Linux compatibility for USB storage devices, probably because many of these
    devices are manufactured, or at least distributed, by rather small (sometimes
    no-name) companies, of which there are too many to deal with.
  prefs: []

- en: It is pretty safe to say that if the device claims to work on both Mac and Windows,
    or if it works on recent Windows versions without the need for a special driver,
    it will probably work on Linux. In the case of card readers, the multi- reader
    variety, which reads a variety of card types, is more likely to give you headaches.
    Better, in my opinion, to stick with those specifically designed for one type
    of card.

    you can try one of the online Linux forums and ask for some recommendations, or
    if you have a particular model in mind, ask if anyone has experience with that
    particular device. And then there is the tried-and-true Google search, as I so
    often suggest for questions of hardware compatibility. Just type the make and
    model of the device in question along with the word “Linux,” and see what happens.

    (Small Computer System Interface) drives. SCSI (pronounced *scuzzy —* Ouch!) devices
    were once the most popular type of peripherals out there, but they have largely
    been supplanted by the cheaper and easier-to-deal-with USB devices. This means
    that such devices, whether real SCSI or USB, will be listed in your Hardware Browser
    as SCSI drives under the **/dev** listings: **/sda**, **/sdb**, **/sdc**, and
    so on, depending on how many of these devices you have. As you might have guessed,
    these listings (sda, sdb, sdc, and so on) stand for SCSI device a, b, c, and so

    window will open, and the message window will vanish. On the left side of the

    a second or third device, it might appear as **sdb1**, or **sdc1**, and so on.
