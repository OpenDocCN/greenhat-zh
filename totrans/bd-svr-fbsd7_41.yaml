- en: OpenSSH is a set of open source utilities that implement the SSH (Secure Shell)
    protocol. SSH is a secure version of telnet; it's a protocol used to access the
    console or command line of remote systems. SSH provides administrators and users
    with access to a remote system as if they were physically at the console.

- en: SSH uses encryption to prevent eavesdropping on connections made between a client
    and server. The telnet protocol lacks encryption; this gives eavesdroppers the
    ability to capture usernames and passwords with a packet sniffer. (A packet sniffer
    is a program designed to monitor and capture network traffic.)

    a survey conducted in November 2005.^([[]](#CHP-17-1)) It is included in virtually
    every distribution of Linux and BSD, as well as Apple's Mac OS X.

- en: The SSH protocol was first developed in 1995 by Tatu Ylönen, a researcher from
    Helsinki University of Technology. Ylönen founded SSH Communications Security
    in late 1995 to develop and market SSH. His company currently markets the SSH
    Tectia Server/Client.

- en: OpenSSH was originally conceived by the OpenBSD team as part of the OpenBSD
    2.6 release in December 1999\. The team used code from Tatu Ylönen's SSH project,
    which was originally open source. Bugs were fixed and features were added to the
    OpenSSH release. Soon after the release of OpenSSH, its developers decided to
    split into two teams. One group concentrated on the development of OpenSSH for
    OpenBSD while the other group developed a portable version of OpenSSH for use
    on other platforms. The portable edition has the letter P appended to the version
    to signify this. OpenSSH is still developed by the OpenBSD team and is led by
    its founder, Theo de Raadt.
