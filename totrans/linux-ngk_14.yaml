    move on to the artistic side of Linux. Yes, Linux does art, and as you will soon
    find out, there are a good number of programs on your system that allow you to
    create and manipulate graphic files. The most notable (and famous) of these applications
    is the GIMP, which you might think of as the Linux equivalent of Adobe Photoshop.
    To run the GIMP, just go to the Main menu, and select **Graphics** > **The GIMP**.

    by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then selecting **Image**
    > **Scale Image** in the pop-up menu. This will bring up the Scale Image window,
    where you can set the new size of the image.

    to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (.bmp) file and save it as a PNG
    (.png) file, or save a JPEG (.jpg) file as a GIF (.gif) file, and so on. The GIMP
    supports an extremely wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save
    an image file as a compressed tarball. To perform a file conversion, just right-
    click an image opened within the GIMP and then select **File** > **Save As** in
    the pop-up menu. This will bring up a dialog box in which you can specify the
    new file format by replacing the original file extension in the **Selection**
    box at the bottom of the window with the extension for the format you want to
    convert the image to.

    a while. Of course, you should make a backup copy of any file you are planning
    to experiment with before doing so. If you prefer working through tutorials to
    just finding things out by goofing around, the GIMP Documentation page([www.gimp.org/tutorials.html](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials.html))
    has a number of links to tutorials covering various functions, features, and skill
    levels. In my opinion, the best of these is the GIMP Tutorials page ([http://empyrean.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/](http://empyrean.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/)

    These are images in which the location and color of every single pixel is recorded.
    The image is essentially a collection of dots, or bits. The file you create is
    thus a rather hefty map of these bits (hence its name), and this map tells your
    system where everything in your image is supposed to go when it is displayed or
    printed.

    vector image file is a collection of mathematical formulae representing the various
    shapes in your image. This may sound rather unimportant to you, but such drawings
    have advantages in certain cases. One of these advantages is that vector image
    files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another, and perhaps
    the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain their smooth
    edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as a bitmap, for example,
    would begin to show jagged edges (the jaggies) when enlarged to any extent, while
    the same circle in a vector image would remain smooth and round no matter how
    much you increased its size.

    is significantly better. Linux supports over 400 cameras through the gPhoto2 digital
    camera software package, which is a part of the default installation in Fedora
    Core. To see if your camera is supported, go to the gPhoto2 project page ([www.gphoto.org](http://www.gphoto.org)),
    and scroll down and click the link that says **400 cameras**. Once on that page
    you will find a complete list of all the cameras supported by gPhoto2\. If your
    camera isn’t on the list, it most likely means (as that page points out) that
    your camera is so old that there is little demand for support for it or that it
    is so new that there hasn’t been enough time to develop support for it. Of course,
    gPhoto2 is constantly being updated, so if your camera isn’t on the list now,
    it could very well be so in the future. Updating gPhoto2 with Synaptic now and
    again, should keep you as up to date as possible.
  prefs: []

    get cracking right away, all is not lost because you can still get your images
    to your hard disk by setting up your system to work with a USB flash memory card
    reader, as I discussed in [Chapter 12](DDU0089_split_000.html#520). After adding
    your card reader to your system’s *fstab* file, remove the flash media card from
    your camera, pop it into your USB card reader, and then mount the reader by right-clicking
    your desktop and selecting **Disks** > **cardreader** (or whatever you named it).
    Once you’ve done that, it is a simple drag-and-drop process to get the images
    to your hard disk. Of course, you can use this method even if your camera is supported,
    which I think is the easiest way to deal with things.

    however, you need to connect your camera to your computer, usually via a USB cable.
    Once you’ve done that, turn your camera on and set it to communicate with your

    will be gone for good.
