  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FreeBSD is a free, UNIX-like operating system based on BSD (the Berkeley Software
    Distribution), which was originally developed at the University of California,
    Berkeley. FreeBSD is open source software; the source code (software blueprint)
    is freely available to the public to be modified or improved upon.

- en: FreeBSD is developed as an entire operating system that includes the kernel
    (the core of the operating system), a shell (the user interface), and device drivers
    (software that controls hardware). The Linux kernel, on the other hand, is developed
    separately from the Linux userland. In other words, the shell, system utilities,
    and applications are developed separately and are packaged with the kernel as
    various distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, and so on).

- en: The standard FreeBSD distribution includes a proven array of powerful utilities
    together with a massive library of dynamically developed third-party software
    known as the ports collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ports collection is one of the most convenient features of FreeBSD. It is
    laid out as a hierarchy of categorical directories containing makefiles (scripts
    that build software from source code). Each makefile contains scripts that patch,
    compile, and install applications automatically, making it relatively easy to
    install and track software.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FreeBSD had its beginnings when Bell Labs employees Ken Thompson and Dennis
    Ritchie presented a paper on UNIX at the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)
    Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1973\. A UC Berkeley professor, Robert
    Fabry, heard their presentation and convinced staff at UC Berkeley to purchase
    a PDP-11 (a 16-bit computer built by Digital Equipment Corporation, costing nearly
    $11,000 at the time) to run Thompson's AT&T UNIX. The system's popularity grew
    and Berkeley faculty and students set up a system to share time on the PDP-11.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With UNIX running on the PDP-11, two Berkeley graduate students, Bill Joy and
    Chuck Haley, began to write programs for UNIX. UNIX development at Berkeley eventually
    caught the eye of the US government, and the Department of Defense awarded UC
    Berkeley a contract to create a customized version of UNIX for use by its contractors
    working with DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). Code developed
    at Berkeley was integrated into the existing AT&T UNIX system to meet the needs
    of the DARPA project, and Joy was chosen to lead the project, which he did until
    mid-1982 when he left to co-found Sun Microsystems. (Bill Joy was also the creator
    of the vi text editor and developed the TCP/IP stack for UNIX.)

- en: Corporate interest in using Berkeley's BSD Unix grew. However, at the time,
    BSD Unix contained source code from AT&T UNIX, requiring that a license fee be
    paid to AT&T for its use. This fee was cost-prohibitive for many small companies
    and liberation from AT&T's license became a priority. Developers were called upon
    en masse to rewrite and replace the AT&T kernel and utilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After considerable coding effort, BSD Unix was free of AT&T code in 1991, but
    it still lacked six kernel files needed to make it fully functional. These files,
    originally coded by AT&T, were not easily rewritable. In late 1991, Bill and Lynne
    Jolitz (two UC Berkeley alumni) coded the six missing files and released 386/BSD.
    The FreeBSD Project, responsible for development of the FreeBSD operating system,
    was formed a few months later and based its initial code on the Jolitzes' 386/BSD.

- en: In January of 1992, Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDI) began to sell a commercial
    version of Unix that was also based on 386/BSD. In late 1992 UNIX System Labs
    (a subsidiary of AT&T responsible for UNIX development) filed a lawsuit against
    both BSDI and UC Berkeley citing copyright infringement and unauthorized release
    of trade secrets. A settlement was reached in January of 1994 that required small
    modifications to be made to the Berkeley code. The resultant code, released as
    4.4BSD-Lite, is the foundation of the current FreeBSD.
