- en: ddclient is an open source program written in Perl. It is used to automatically
    update dynamic DNS (domain name system) entries for a variety of dynamic DNS service
    providers. When ddclient detects that the system's IP address has changed, it
    sends the new IP address information to your designated dynamic DNS service provider.
    This enables systems with dynamically assigned IP addresses to maintain resolvability
    (stay reachable) by the Internet domain name system, regardless of IP address
    changes made by their ISPs.

- en: ddclient includes native support for several brands of NAT routers. It stays
    updated by extracting current IP information from the router's built-in status
    page. If your router is unsupported, ddclient can be configured to retrieve system
    IP address information via the Web. This guide provides information on retrieving
    IP address information via the Web rather than using your router's status page.
