Some experimenters and tinkerers with more time than money have even designed their own antennas out of tin cans, potato chip canisters, and junk from their basement workshops. They have generally discovered that Wi-Fi links can be a reliable way to move data across a lot of ground.</p><p>This chapter contains information about designing and using point-to-point wireless network links. A <span class="emphasis"><em>point-to-point wireless link</em></span> can be part of a larger Wi-Fi network, it can act as a simple bridge between two wired LANs, or it can add a single distant site to an existing LAN. Point-to-point service differs from other Wi-Fi networks because it moves data between two specific locations rather than broadcasting a network signal to any network client within range of the radio signal. It's also possible to use Wi-Fi as part of a wireless gateway that provides Internet access to a community or an isolated location where <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1057"/>affordable landlines are not available.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1058"/></p><p>Why extend a wireless network? Point-to-point links can serve several <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1059"/>purposes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It can extend a single network to include users in more than one building. In an office park or on a college campus, a business or academic department that occupies space in more than one building can use wireless to share LAN services across all the organization's locations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It can move data across a barrier such as a highway or a river. If there's a clean line of sight, a wireless link can jump across a gap that could make it difficult or impossible to string cables from one building to another.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It can provide LAN and high-speed Internet access to users and unattended computers in remote locations. A wireless link can extend a broadband connection to places that are not served by broadband DSL or cable modem Internet service, or even by Plain Old Telephone Service.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It can establish wireless network links as an inexpensive alternative to leased lines. Private data circuits supplied by the telephone company or other common carriers normally involve a one-time installation fee and a recurring monthly payment. The annual cost of a leased line can often be many times greater than the one-time cost of buying and installing a radio link.</p></li></ul></div><p>In a sense, a point-to-point Wi-Fi network link is a completely different category from a wireless LAN. Both use the same radio technology, and it's quite possible to extend a wireless LAN beyond the limits of a single building, but a point-to-point link could just as easily use some other type of radio modulation at some other frequency, rather than DSSS at 2.4 GHz, and perform the same function. You can find some pointers to alternative methods for connecting remote sites to your network later in this chapter.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="extending_the_lan"/>Extending the LAN</h1></div></div></div><p>A point-to-point wireless network link can be either a LAN at one end connected to a single client device at the other end or a bridge between two LANs. In other words, the end points of a link can be either a single computer or other device, or a full network.</p><p>A wireless LAN with a remote client, like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#a_point-to-point_wireless_link_can_conne" title="Figure 10-1. A point-to-point wireless link can connect to a single device in a remote location.">Figure 10-1</a>, works the same way as a network with two or more access points within a single building. The only difference is that one or more access points connected to the LAN use an outdoor antenna aimed at a client computer in a remote location. The remote computer appears to the network exactly like every other computer on the same LAN.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1060"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1061"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_point-to-point_wireless_link_can_conne"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e11392"/><img alt="A point-to-point wireless link can connect to a single device in a remote location." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254088.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 10-1. A point-to-point wireless link can connect to a single device in a remote location.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A wireless network bridge, like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#a_wireless_link_can_also_extend_a_lan_to" title="Figure 10-2. A wireless link can also extend a LAN to two or more buildings.">Figure 10-2</a>, is a link between two segments of the same LAN.

A relay point can be situated at an isolated location, such as a radio tower or a rooftop, or a place with additional network clients, such as a third building between the two end points.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1064"/></p><p>A point-to-point link can use any access point and network adapter that has connectors for external antennas. However, several manufacturers offer wireless routers that have been specifically designed for outdoor bridging applications, which are often a better choice. Routers made by <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1065"/>Plexus, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1066"/>HyperLink Technologies, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1067"/>Cisco, and other manufacturers all combine access points <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1068"/>with routers, so they make the network a lot easier to assemble.</p></div></div>

In other words, a bridge router provides a wireless link between two parts of the same LAN. Many of the same manufacturers that make access points and network interfaces also offer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1069"/>bridge routers as part of their product lines. <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#a_bridge_uses_wi-fi_to_connect_a_remote_" title="Figure 10-3. A bridge uses Wi-Fi to connect a remote location to a LAN.">Figure 10-3</a> shows a Wi-Fi bridge router as part of an extended LAN.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1070"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_bridge_uses_wi-fi_to_connect_a_remote_"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e11466"/><img alt="A bridge uses Wi-Fi to connect a remote location to a LAN." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254763.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 10-3. A bridge uses Wi-Fi to connect a remote location to a LAN.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>You could use a bridge router to share a LAN or single broadband Internet connection among two or more buildings.

An access point that provides wireless service to any location within a designated area (such as an office or a house) is a <span class="emphasis"><em>point-to-multipoint</em></span> service; it can exchange data with many network clients at the same time.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1071"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1072"/></p><p>A point-to-point link has a different objective: It moves as many of the radiated signals as possible between two fixed locations. Radio signals move across the link in both directions, so each access point, router, or network adapter uses the same antenna for both transmitting and receiving. The goal is to focus the radio signal toward the antenna at the other end of the link, so at least one of the end points uses a directional antenna. If the link covers a long distance, both antennas should be directional for the strongest possible signals.</p><p>In a campus or similar area where the network connects several buildings, the network links can be split to distribute network service from a central location to remote sites in more than one direction. In this kind of system, the central access point uses a nondirectional antenna, and each remote uses a directional antenna, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10s03.html#an_omnidirectional_antenna_can_distribut" title="Figure 10-4. An omnidirectional antenna can distribute signals to two or more remote locations at the same time.">Figure 10-4</a>. In a system where two remote sites are in the same general location relative to the primary base station, the best choice might be a directional antenna with a wider operating angle.

In theory, it ought to be possible to calculate the required height of both antennas and identify the path between them, but it almost never works out that way. There's almost always a certain amount of tweaking required before you can fire up your radios and start to move data across the network. You can perform a preliminary survey with a good map (such as a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1073"/>topographical map from the US Geological Survey), but at some point you will want to climb up onto the roof (or look out the window) and confirm that there's a line of sight to the place you want to put the other end of the link. If the path extends more than a few hundred yards, bring a pair of binoculars with you.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1074"/></p><p>You can generally place an antenna on your own building without any special permits, but if you want to use the roof of a commercial building, you will probably need permission from the property owner and possibly from the local zoning board or other land-use agency. This probably won't be a problem when you're mounting an inconspicuous antenna, but keep it in mind if you have to use a relatively large dish or something similar. If you're using an existing pole or tower to support the antenna, make sure you're not producing or receiving interference with other antennas nearby.</p><p>Climbing a pole or tower with a belt full of tools and securely mounting a bulky antenna in a precise position 30 or more feet in the air is not a casual afternoon project. Don't even consider it without appropriate safety equipment, including hard hats for everybody involved—a dropped wrench or bolt can be lethal. If you don't have experience with this kind of work, there's no shame in hiring somebody to do the job for you. The people who sell point-to-point antennas can tell you where to find a qualified antenna rigger in your area.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="choose_a_signal_path"/>Choose a Signal Path</h2></div></div></div><p>The first step in <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1075"/>installing a link is to decide exactly where it will go. If you're just extending the network across a parking lot or a highway, the path will be obvious; choose a location that avoids the big tree in front of the building. But if the distance between antennas is more than about half a mile, you will probably want to lay out the path on a map first.</p><p>Topographical maps, either on paper or online, will give you the best level of detail. See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.topozone.com">http://www.topozone.com</a> for maps of the entire United States; <a class="ulink" href="http://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca">http://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca</a> is the source for maps of Canada. If the exact locations for both end points are not immediately obvious on a map, a GPS device can provide precise geographic coordinates.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="reaching_the_boondocks_long-range_links"/>Reaching the Boondocks: Long-Range Links</h2></div></div></div><p>The distance covered by most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1076"/>point-to-point wireless network links can probably be measured in yards rather than miles (or if you prefer, in meters rather than kilometers), so <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1077"/>installing the link is relatively easy. The other end of the link is in plain sight, so the antennas are easy to aim at each other. Signal strength is usually not a problem on a short hop, especially with directional antennas.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1078"/></p><p>A longer link is possible, but it's more difficult to set up because the signal will be weaker, and it's a lot more important to point the antennas accurately. <a class="xref" href="ch10s04.html#a_small_angle_change_in_the_direction_of" title="Figure 10-5. A small angle change in the direction of an antenna can have a huge effect on the connection if a receiver is several miles away.">Figure 10-5</a> (and some common sense) shows why a receiver becomes harder to find as you move farther away from the transmitter.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_small_angle_change_in_the_direction_of"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e11568"/><img alt="A small angle change in the direction of an antenna can have a huge effect on the connection if a receiver is several miles away." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254278.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 10-5. A small angle change in the direction of an antenna can have a huge effect on the connection if a receiver is several miles away.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>It's also more difficult to locate a particular building or other end point with the unaided eye when it's one of many buildings on a hillside or in a valley several miles away, so a telescope or a pair of binoculars is an essential part of your installation tool bag. Starting at the location where the network connection is already in place, look for the target site from the roof or an upper-story window. If you can find it, you can probably install a network link from here to there.</p><p>However, at least one of the antennas in a long-range link must be high enough to overcome the obstructions caused by <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1079"/>Fresnel zone interference and the curvature of the earth. This isn't a serious problem for a one- or two-mile link—the roof of a two-story building is probably high enough to give you the clearance you need unless there are a lot of trees in the way—but if you're trying to push a signal five miles or more, the height of the antenna is a significant issue. This is the reason you often see radio towers on top of hills and tall buildings.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="aligning_the_antennas"/>Aligning the Antennas</h2></div></div></div><p>For best performance, a directional antenna must be aimed directly toward the antenna at the other end of the link. If the antennas at both end points are directional, they must both be pointed correctly. In most cases, the best place to locate an antenna is on the roof or a tower, or bolted to an outside wall, but sometimes it's possible to place it indoors next to a window if there's a clean line of sight to the other end of the link.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1080"/></p><p>It's entirely possible to align a pair of antennas by watching the signal strength display in your Wi-Fi configuration software, but when you're working with <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1081"/>long-range links and weak signals, a piece of test equipment called a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1082"/>spectrum analyzer will provide much more precise information. A <span class="emphasis"><em>spectrum analyzer</em></span> is a special-purpose radio receiver that displays a portion of the radio spectrum as a visual image. Because the display shows any radio signal it detects as a spike in the graphic display, the spike will grow larger as the signal strength increases. Therefore, you can use the display to find the best possible positions for your antennas.</p><p>Unfortunately, most general-purpose spectrum analyzers that can display a 2.4 GHz signal are quite expensive devices—a new one will probably cost several thousand dollars or more. However, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1083"/>MetaGeek (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.metageek.net">http://www.metageek.net</a>) makes a simple and relatively inexpensive USB <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1084"/>spectrum analyzer called Wi-Spy, which is designed specifically for evaluating signals within the 2.4 GHz band. <a class="xref" href="ch10s04.html#the_metageek_wi-spy_spectrum_analyzer_pr" title="Figure 10-6. The MetaGeek Wi-Spy spectrum analyzer provides a graphic display of Wi-Fi radio signals.">Figure 10-6</a> shows the display from a laptop connected to a Wi-Spy analyzer.

At a bare minimum, you will need one person at each end to adjust the antenna's positions to find the strongest signal; if an antenna is not right next to the computer or spectrum analyzer, you will want one person watching the screen while another moves the antenna. If you can place a team at each end of the link with telephones or two-way radios, it will save a lot of time and aggravation.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1088"/></p><p>To aim the antennas properly, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Choose the exact location where you want to install each antenna and securely mount the masts or poles that will hold it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use the mounting hardware supplied with each antenna to attach it to the mast, pole, or other supporting structure.

If you are using a spectrum analyzer, tune it to the frequency <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1089"/>of the radio channel that your access point or router is using. If you don't have a spectrum analyzer, start the configuration utility on your network device. If only one end of the network link has a directional antenna, that's the one to adjust.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Slowly move the antenna connected to the router or the spectrum analyzer. You should see a peak in the signal strength display when this antenna is aimed directly at the other end of the link. Move the antenna left and right first, and then adjust the vertical angle. When the signal strength display or the spectrum analyzer shows the strongest signal, tighten the antenna mounting hardware to maintain that position.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the other antenna is also directional, repeat the signal peaking process.

If you can't get enough signal through the link to produce a usable network connection, make sure both the network adapter and the access point are set to operate at full power. If that's not enough to provide a useful signal, you might have to boost the signal with an RF amplifier or replace one or both antennas with other antennas that have more gain.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="obstructions_and_relays"/>Obstructions and Relays</h2></div></div></div><p>Each antenna in a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1090"/>point-to-point link must have an unobstructed <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1091"/>line of sight to the antenna at the other end of the link. If there's a building or a mountain between the origin and the destination, you'll have to find a way to get your signal over or around it. If the signal path goes through a wooded area, try to run your site survey during the spring or summer because a signal that passes through bare branches without any trouble can often be shut down by leaves and other foliage.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1092"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1093"/></p><p>You can't bend a radio signal around an obstruction, so the only way to get past it is to use a repeater at a location that has a line of sight to both end points. A repeater can be a single router with space <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1094"/>for two radios, such as the Proxim <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1095"/>Outdoor Router, two separate routers connected through an Ethernet network cable, or a pair of access points connected through a network hub.

So, for example, the central control point of a Wi-Fi network might be located on a valley floor with a link to a relay point on a nearby hilltop or rooftop. From the hilltop repeater, the same network can be extended to two or more locations in as many different directions.</p></div></div>

But it's also possible to use other <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1100"/>radios that use different (licensed or unlicensed) radio frequencies or different types of radio signals.</p><p>The IEEE <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1101"/>802.11 specification (without any other suffix letter) covers radios that use both <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1102"/>direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1103"/>frequency-hopping spread spectrum (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1104"/>FHSS) modulation. In a radio environment where <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1105"/>interference from other wireless LANs is a problem, a different technology can often cut through the noise to produce a stronger and cleaner stream of data.</p><p>Each type of radio offers a different combination of data transmission speed and signal range. For example, BreezeCom's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1106"/>PRO.11 family of wireless network products use FHSS radios that can move data at up to 3Mbps over a distance of up to 30 miles. A BreezeCom <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1107"/>Workgroup Bridge connects directly to a 10Base-T Ethernet LAN.</p><p>If the 11Mbps data speed of an 802.11b is not fast enough to meet your requirements, other devices can provide faster connections, but they generally have shorter ranges than a Wi-Fi link. 802.11a equipment has a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1108"/>maximum data speed of around 54Mbps at 5 GHz. C-SPEC's OverLAN HS 100 has a top speed of about 100Mbps, but the signal range is significantly shorter than a Wi-Fi link.</p><p>For links with a degraded line of sight, modified Atheros radios from <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1109"/>Ubiquity Networks use the 802.11g OFDM encoding at 900 MHz, which can handle interference from foliage and buildings much more effectively.</p><p>This is a book about wireless networks, but sometimes it's useful to remember that the point of the exercise is to establish a network connection or access to the Internet and not a wireless link. If a broadband connection to the Internet already exists at the remote location, go ahead and use it. Just because a point-to-point wireless link is possible, it's not always necessary.</p><p>For example, a virtual private network can provide all the advantages of a point-to-point wireless link without the hassles of setting up a pair of antennas. As far as the people using the network are concerned, a single network with a VPN tunnel connecting two or more buildings looks just like a network with a radio link. Another approach that can often be effective is to run cables from one building to the next through utility tunnels.</p></div>

You might find a PC Card adapter with an antenna connector, but Buffalo and other manufacturers offer USB Wi-Fi network adapters that can use an external antenna.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1110"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1111"/></p><p>Because some adapters use proprietary antenna connectors, they require a special cable called a <span class="emphasis"><em>pigtail</em></span> with a standard antenna cable connector at one end and a plug that matches the adapter's connector at the other. A proprietary pigtail can cost more than the network adapter, but comparable pigtails are also available at less than a third of the adapter maker's prices from several other sources, including <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1112"/>Fleeman Anderson &amp; Bird (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fab-corp.com">http://www.fab-corp.com</a>) and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1113"/>HyperLink Technologies (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hyperlinktech.com">http://www.hyperlinktech.com</a>). The small cables used for pigtails can often be the most poorly shielded component in your network; always keep pigtails as short as possible to maximize the signal strength.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1114"/></p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="build_your_own_antenna"/>Build Your Own Antenna?</h2></div></div></div><p>Many community network enthusiasts have designed and built their own antennas out of odd hardware, plastic spacers, copper wire, and empty cans. Depending on the contents of your junk box and your pantry, the materials for a homemade high-gain directional antenna might cost as little as three or four dollars, not counting the price of a can of coffee, beef stew, or potato chips. If you have to go out and buy all the parts and hand tools necessary for the project, you might spend $20 or more.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1115"/></p><p>However, when you add the value of the time necessary to assemble the antenna and tweak it for optimal performance, it's not at all clear that rolling your own would be less expensive than buying an inexpensive commercial antenna. It's not unusual to spend three to six hours or more assembling one of these "cheap" <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1116"/>home brew antennas. A few minutes of online searching (look for "2.4 GHz antenna") should find several sources for store-bought directional antennas under $25 that will work at least as well as the ones you can build. Keep in mind that your access point or network client adapter doesn't need an antenna that can handle high power, so you can get by with a relatively lightweight unit.</p><p>The most common type of directional antenna for point-to-point communication is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>yagi</em></span>, or more properly, a Yagi-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1117"/>Uda <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1118"/>antenna system. It was named for the two Japanese engineers, Professor Hidetsugu Yagi and Professor Shintaro Uda of Tohuku University, who designed and constructed the first ones around 1926. A typical yagi antenna, like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10s06.html#a_yagi_antenna_has_one_active_element_on" title="Figure 10-7. A yagi antenna has one active element, one reflector, and several directors.">Figure 10-7</a>, has a single active element whose length is exactly half the wavelength of the radio frequency at which the antenna will operate (at 2.4 GHz, that's about 2.35 inches). Quarter-wavelength elements will also work. Additional elements, called <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1119"/>reflectors and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1120"/>directors, are located parallel to the active element at very specific intervals determined by the size of the active element. Reflectors are located behind the active element, while the directors are in front of it. Most of the rooftop television aerials that were common <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1121"/>before the days of cable and satellites were <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1122"/>yagis.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1123"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_yagi_antenna_has_one_active_element_on"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e11909"/><img alt="A yagi antenna has one active element, one reflector, and several directors." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254368.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 10-7. A yagi antenna has one active element, one reflector, and several directors.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A yagi always has just one reflector, which is about 5 percent longer than the active element, and several directors, which are about 5 percent shorter than the active element (each additional director should be slightly shorter than the one behind it). As you add more elements to a yagi, the amount of gain increases. If you want to consider <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1124"/>building a yagi of your own, take a look at Rob <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1125"/>Flickenger's antenna built inside a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1126"/>Pringles potato chip can at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448">http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448</a>.</p><p>Many designs for home brew 2.4 GHz yagi <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1127"/>antennas use one-inch washers as reflectors, directors, and active elements. This will work, but it's not ideal for two reasons: First, at 2.437 GHz (the center frequency of Wi-Fi channel 6) a quarter-wavelength active element should be about 1.16 inches long, so those washers are about 16 percent smaller than they ought to be for ideal performance; and second, the reflector and directors are the same size as the active element, which reduces the gain (or sensitivity) of the antenna. But considering that the whole thing was built out of about $7 worth of parts, it's close enough. If a pair of these antennas gets your signal from here to there and back again at high speed, it really doesn't matter that the reflectors and directors aren't exactly the right size.</p><p>Darren <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-10-1128"/>Fulton's more traditional 13-element design at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.users.bigpond.com/Darren.fulton/yagi/13_element_yagi_antenna_for_2.htm">http://www.users.bigpond.com/Darren.fulton/yagi/13_element_yagi_antenna_for_2.htm</a>, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10s06.html#darren_fultons_home_brew_yagi_antenna_ha" title="Figure 10-8. Darren Fulton's home brew yagi antenna has a total of 13 elements.">Figure 10-8</a>, uses antenna elements cut to length from heavy-gauge brass or copper wire and a reflector made of sheet aluminum.</p><div class="figure"><a id="darren_fultons_home_brew_yagi_antenna_ha"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e11953"/><img alt="Darren Fulton's home brew yagi antenna has a total of 13 elements." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254015.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 10-8. Darren Fulton's home brew yagi antenna has a total of 13 elements.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A yagi isn't the only type of directional antenna that lends itself to build-it-yourself designs. Waveguide antennas, with a radiating element inside a reflective metal cylinder or cone, use another extremely effective design. The antenna's performance depends on the size of the enclosure, the length of the radiating element, and its exact position. Greg Rehm's instructions for assembling a tin can waveguide antenna are online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html">http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html</a>.</p><p>If you want to boost your signal gain in all directions, you should use an omnidirectional antenna. The instructions at <a class="ulink" href="http://jgomsi.com/obelix/wireless/guerrilla2/">http://jgomsi.com/obelix/wireless/guerrilla2/</a> are a good place to start.</p><p>Based on the tests and measurements posted on the Internet for these and other home brew antennas, it appears that they're both effective and cheap, especially if you don't include the value of your time when you calculate the cost. It's all a matter of attitude: If you thought "that sounds like a fun project" when you read about building a home brew antenna, go for it. But if spending an afternoon with a soldering iron in your hand sounds like a form of cruel and unusual punishment, remember that an inexpensive commercial antenna will do the same job just as well, with a lot less effort.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm10_d1e11969"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm10_d1e11974"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm10_d1e11979"/></p></div></div></body></html>
