    bewildering, and it uncomfortably straddles both the analog and digital
    worlds. It’s not always clear if a particular device will work with a
    computer, or what devices are necessary for digital audio
    recording.<a id="IDX-APP-A-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0053" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This appendix contains a sampling of sound cards, mixers,
    analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters, microphones, and portable
    digital recorders in various price ranges to give you an idea of what is
    available. This is far from a comprehensive catalog, but hopefully it will
    give you a good start in understanding audio gear.</p><p>The simplest Audacity recording setup needs three things: a computer
    running Audacity, an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter, and
    some kind of interface to connect microphones or musical instruments to
    your ADC/DAC. This could be as simple as a laptop and a microphone. You
    can start out cheap and simple and build up over time as you want.</p><p>Prices, models, features, and operating system support are all
    moving targets. My favorite online shopping site is zZounds (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zzounds.com/">http://www.zzounds.com/</a>). They carry a huge inventory, have
    great prices, and provide the best customer service. B&amp;H Photo Video
    are also first-rate (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/</a>).
    Both sites are great for learning about products and pricing, and they
    generate a lot of useful customer reviews.<a id="IDX-APP-A-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0056" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0061" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="PCI, PCI-e, PCMCIA Sound Cards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pci_comma_pci-e_comma_pcmcia_sound_cards"/>PCI, PCI-e, PCMCIA Sound Cards</h1></div></div></div><p>I like PCI and PCI-e for very fast, trouble-free multichannel
      recording. PCI-e is faster than PCI, because each PCI-e slot has its
      down dedicated bus while PCI devices share bandwidth. Both are excellent
      and least-hassle.</p><p>PCMCIA interfaces are for laptops. PCI, PCI-e, and PCMCIA often
      require separate breakout boxes for connecting mics, mixers, preamps,
      and other devices. Some of them, in place of breakout boxes, use
      breakout cable bundles.</p><div class="sect2" title="PCI"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pci"/>PCI</h2></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Digigram VX222HR</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>24-bit/192 kHz ADC/DAC, 2/2 stereo balanced analog and
