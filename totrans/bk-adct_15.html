    beta for the final 2.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> release. The Audacity
    developers are on fire and making a large number of excellent improvements
    and additions. What you see in this chapter should be very close to what
    the final release looks like, but don’t be surprised if there are some
    differences.</p><div class="sect1" title="Customizing Audacity's Default Options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="customizing_audacity_apostrophy_s_def"/>Customizing Audacity's Default Options</h1></div></div></div><p>Audacity’s default options are set in <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>, which you can also open by

      operating system. For Windows this should not be MME but Windows
      DirectSound. The Playback and Recording devices should be your specific
      devices. In <a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#selecting_the_default_recording_and_play" title="Figure 15-1. Selecting the default recording and playback devices in Windows">Figure 15-1</a>,
      I have selected the SoundMAX onboard chipset on my ThinkPad. Your sound
      card will probably be something else. You could also select Primary
      Sound Driver, which means the default recording and playback devices are
      selected in the Sound module in the Windows Control Panel.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_the_default_recording_and_play"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject15_d1e20364"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797905.png.jpg" alt="Selecting the default recording and playback devices in Windows"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-1. Selecting the default recording and playback devices in
        Windows</p></div><p>For Linux users, the host will be ALSA, the JACK Audio Connection
      Kit, or the Open Sound System (OSS). The Playback and Recording device
      choosers can use the ALSA defaults or select specific devices (<a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#this_is_how_it_looks_for_linux_users_col" title="Figure 15-2. This is how it looks for Linux users: On my system, the default recording device chooser shows an onboard ATI chipset, the MobilePre USB, and the ALSA default.">Figure 15-2</a>). I think it’s
      better to always choose the specific audio interfaces you want Audacity
      to use, rather than messing around with your system defaults.</p><div class="figure"><a id="this_is_how_it_looks_for_linux_users_col"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject15_d1e20376"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797907.png.jpg" alt="This is how it looks for Linux users: On my system, the default recording device chooser shows an onboard ATI chipset, the MobilePre USB, and the ALSA default."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-2. This is how it looks for Linux users: On my system, the default

      interface supports. If you have a multichannel interface with 10
      channels, for example, you could select 10 even if you weren’t using
      that many. Audacity will then open 10 tracks, so if you record on 6 of
      them, you will have 4 empty tracks.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0007" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      menus) have Preview buttons so you can hear your changes before actually
      applying them to your tracks. Length of preview controls the duration of
      that preview.</p><p>Cut Preview is a slick tool for previewing what your track will
      sound like when you cut out a section of the track. The default is one
      second, but you can set it to whatever you like. Select a portion of a
      track that you think you want to cut, but don’t cut it; just select it.
      Then press the C key on the keyboard, and you’ll hear a preview of the
      audio before and after your selection, just as though you had already
      made the cut. To play the selection, press the spacebar.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Remember how to change the size of a selected area? Make sure you
      have the Selection tool active. Position the cursor near the edge of
      your selection; it should change to a little I-beam. Hold down the
      <span class="keycap">shift</span> key, and then click and drag.
      <span class="keycap">shift</span>-right arrow or <span class="keycap">shift</span>-left arrow expands the selection, and

      <span class="emphasis"><em>jump ahead</em></span> feature. When you’re playing a track,
      press the left- or right-arrow key to jump backward or forward by the
      number of seconds in the Short period setting. Press the <span class="keycap">shift</span> key plus the left- or right-arrow key to
      jump the length of the Long period setting.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0011" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      record a new track while listening to an existing track or tracks. For
      example, you could first record a nice fiddle track. Then with
      overdubbing enabled, the fiddle track will play while you record a vocal
      track, a second fiddle, or whatever you want.</p><p>“Software Playthrough: Listen while recording or monitoring new
      track” enables monitoring of your recording session through your
      playback device. Software Playthrough works only when the recording
      input and playback are on the same sound card. (Linux users: If they are
      separate devices, you can create a connection with JACK.) This isn’t the
      best way to monitor a recording session, because there will likely be
      noticeable lag and it may add enough CPU load to cause skips. A
      dedicated monitoring port on your recording interface is better. If you
      don’t have one, give Software Playthrough a try. (Note that it says to
      “uncheck when recording stereo mix.” In other words, it works only with
      mono tracks.) You can also enable and disable Overdub and Software
      Playthrough from the Transport menu.</p><p>You may find yourself spending some time in the Latency section,
      trying to find the best balance between performance and reducing
      latency. Audio to buffer controls how much audio is buffered in memory.
      When this buffer is larger, performance is smoother, but latency
      increases. When it is smaller, latency decreases, but if the audio
      buffer is too small, your CPU won’t be able to keep up and there will be
      skips and stutters. Higher latency is noticeable when you are
      overdubbing or using Software Playthrough.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Latency correction compensates for the inevitable latency present
      in overdubbing. There is always some latency present in playback, so
      when you overdub, the new track always lags behind the playback track.
      (See <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html" title="Overdubbing">Overdubbing</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html" title="Overdubbing">Overdubbing</a> to
      learn more.)</p><p>Sound Activated Recording can be enabled here, and you can set the
      decibel level for triggering recording. You can also do this from the
      Transport menu.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0015" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      which in this menu are called Sample Rate and Sample Format,
      respectively. These settings can be overridden on the individual Track
      menus and with the Selection toolbar. Mind the terminology confusion
      here—<span class="emphasis"><em>sample format</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>bit
      depth</em></span> are the same thing, but bit depth is the correct term.
      Only in Audacity is bit depth called sample format.</p><p>The Real-time Conversion settings choose the types of sampling
      rate and bit depth conversions that are applied to audio files for
      playback in Audacity. Resampling happens when your audio files have a
      different sampling rate than your project rate. If the bit depth of an
      audio file is different from the project bit depth, it will be converted
      to the project value. This doesn’t change the files because the
      conversion is done on the fly for playback only. Best Sinc Interpolater
      performs the highest-quality conversion. But it is CPU-intensive, so if
      playback bogs down, try Medium Sinc Interpolater. Fast Interpolator,
      Zero order hold (ZOH) interpolator, and Linear interpolation are very
      fast but not very good, and they introduce audible distortion.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0023" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dither</em></span> is deliberately adding a bit of noise
      to smooth out the waveform when a 32- or 24-bit audio file is converted
      to 16 bits. <span class="emphasis"><em>Shaped</em></span> dither is supposed to give the
      best results, and it is the most CPU-intensive.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Triangular</em></span> is a compromise between quality and CPU
      cycles, and <span class="emphasis"><em>rectangular</em></span> is lightweight and makes
      the smallest alterations. You don’t have to apply dithering; your own
      ears will tell you if it makes any improvements or not.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The High-quality Conversion settings are just like the Real-time
      Conversion settings, except they are applied to tracks during mixing and
      export, so unlike the Real-time Conversion settings, your project files
      are changed.</p></div>

      of distortion. It applies the Normalize effect twice, which can increase
      noise. You can modify either of these two chains or create new ones,

            space. If you aren’t going to change the source files, then use
            this option. For example, suppose you have a long live recording
            of your band, and you’re going to edit it and make some CDs and
            downloads from it. If you’re like me, you preserve your originals

            multiple projects. The safe choice is “Always copy all audio into
            project (safest).” “Ask user” is all right if you want to decide

      article “Window Function” (<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function/</a>),
      Blackman-Harris is a lower-resolution, high-dynamic range window, while

      stuck with a very slow computer. Checking this option keeps all
      recording in memory until you stop recording, and then it is written to
      disk. It will certainly speed up performance on a computer with a very
      slow hard drive. But one little power blip or running out of RAM means
      your recording session is lost. There isn’t as much risk on a laptop
      since it has a battery, and you can set a minimum memory threshold to
      trigger writing to disk. Audacity has a hard-coded minimum of 16MB RAM,
