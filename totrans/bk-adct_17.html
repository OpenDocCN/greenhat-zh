            Analog sounds such as a singer or an instrument are converted to
            digital form for recording and editing, then converted back to
            analog for playback. A CD player is a DAC. Your computer sound
            card is an ADC/DAC. An ADC is a crucial piece of equipment. A good
            one performs a good clean accurate conversion without introducing
            noise. Bad ones sound strange and add noise. Some are designed to
            add some color, for example to sound like a certain classic tube
            amp or recording style from the old days.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0088" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0089" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0090" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Amplitude</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Amplitude, as it relates to sounds, can be thought of as
            <span class="emphasis"><em>pressure</em></span>; the greater the pressure, the
            louder the sound. It is also described as
            <span class="emphasis"><em>intensity</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>energy</em></span>. You
            can see amplitude in a waveform, as in <a class="xref" href="apb.html#two_identical_sine_waves_with_different" title="Figure B-1. Two identical sine waves with different amplitudes">Figure B-1</a>. Higher peaks
            mean greater amplitude. Both tracks are 1,000 Hz sine waves
            created with the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span> &gt;
            <span class="strong"><strong>Tone</strong></span> dialog. The top track has
            an amplitude of 1.0, and the bottom track has an amplitude of 0.2.
            These two tones are identical except for their
            amplitudes.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0091" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="two_identical_sine_waves_with_different"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e21540"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797943.png.jpg" alt="Two identical sine waves with different amplitudes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure B-1. Two identical sine waves with different
              amplitudes</p></div><p>This is physical pressure, which you can experience under
            certain conditions. For example, you can see the cone of a
            subwoofer pulsate when it is cranked up loud enough and feel the
            air movement when you place your hand in front of it. (And people
            miles away can “enjoy” listening to it.) Bill Nye the Science Guy
            has a cool stunt where he extinguishes a candle with a homemade
            sonic cannon. A loud blast of sound will ripple water.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0092" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Sonic cannons have been tested in a number of creative ways,
            such as being used as nonlethal police weapons for dispersing
            crowds. Theoretically, a powerful enough sound blast at the right
            frequency will burst eardrums. At less powerful levels, and at the
            right frequencies, it will create nausea and feelings of
            discomfort and nervousness.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0093" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Ambience, Ambient
          Sounds</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Any sounds from your surrounding environment. Ambient sounds
            add color and energy, such as crowd noises, the sounds of birds
            and wind in the trees, or the special sound qualities from
            recording in a special location such as an open ampitheater or an
            old cathedral. Ambient sounds can also be unpleasant, like traffic
            noise and barking dogs.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0094" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Analog
          Hole</strong></span></dt><dd><p>A scary bogeyman invented by the entertainment industry that
            demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of both technology and
            customer service. Digital media players must convert audio and
            video to an analog form so we can hear and see it; this is what
            comes out of your speakers and is what you see on your television.
            If we can see it, it can be photographed, and if we can hear it,
            so can a microphone. Of course, making copies in these ways
            results in lower-quality copies, but it shows there is no way to
            prevent copying by technological means. The industry’s efforts to
            “close the analog hole” have resulted in crippled home
            entertainment receivers that send a purposely degraded signal to
            the analog outputs or that have disabled the analog outputs. This
            sort of crippling does not differentiate between media that you
            have the right use however you want, such as your home movies on
            DVD and homemade music CDs, and the mass-produced gluck they are
            trying to “protect.”<a id="IDX-APP-B-0095" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It’s all futile anyway, since all forms of copy protection
            are cracked sooner or later, and then you can easily make perfect
            digital copies.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0096" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Bit Depth</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Controls dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and overall
            fidelity and accuracy. A wider dynamic range results in a higher
            signal-to-noise ratio, which is also called a lower
            <span class="emphasis"><em>noise floor</em></span>. In other words, you get more of
            the sound you want and less noise introduced by your equipment. In
            the olden days of recording on tape, there was always tape hiss
            and a certain amount of noise from the tape machines. On vinyl
            LPs, there is noise from defects in the vinyl and turntable hum.
            In digital audio, noise comes from your electronics; good
            electronics are described as delivering a clean sound without any
            introduced noise.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0097" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The common bit depths for audio production are 16 bits, 24
            bits, 32 bits, and 32-bit floating point. A larger bit depth
            results in a more accurate, more faithful conversion from
            analog.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0098" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Bit depth goes hand in hand with <span class="emphasis"><em>sampling
            rate</em></span>. Your analog-to-digital converter “samples” the
            audio signal so many times per second. For example, CD-quality is
            16 bits at a sampling rate of 44,100 times per second. Each
            individual sample is given a binary 16-bit value. Converted to
            decimal, each sample is equal to or less than 65,535
            (0–65,535).<a id="IDX-APP-B-0099" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0100" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0101" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0102" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0103" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0104" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0105" class="indexterm"/></p><p>24-bit depth has a range of 0–16,777,216 possible values,
            and 32-bit has 0–4,294,967,295. Note that these are unsigned
            integer values. For example, 32-bit floating point is a 24-bit
            mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. Audacity and many other audio
            recording applications and DAWs use 32-bit float internally
            because the floating decimal point allows for a very high level of
            precision and creates all kinds of extra headroom so you can
            manipulate your audio files in all kinds of ways without degrading
            them.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0106" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A bit depth of 16 has a potential dynamic range of 96 dB; 24
            bits, 144 dB; and 32 bits, 192 dB. Audio hardware has a hard limit
            of about 115 dB. The potential dynamic range of 32-bit float is
            about 1,500 dB, which means a super low noise floor and far less
            potential for clipping.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0107" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In some of Audacity’s configuration dialogs bit depth is
            called <span class="emphasis"><em>sample format</em></span>. Bit depth is the
            correct term.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0108" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Channel</strong></span></dt><dd><p>A single path for any signal. For example, a mono microphone
            plugged into a mono input is one input channel. A stereo signal
            routed to two speakers has two playback channels. A music system
            with discrete 5.1 surround sound has six playback channels. If you
            plug 10 performers into a mixer and then plug that mixer into a
            single mono channel, that is still one input channel even though
            your entire band is recording into it.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0109" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Many surround-sound receivers can emulate multichannel
            surround from a stereo recording. This is not discrete
            multichannel surround but plain old two-channel stereo.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Clipping</strong></span></dt><dd><p>When a digital audio signal goes over zero dBFS, it is
            truncated to the maximum value of the bit depth you are recording
            in. This can sound pretty awful, so avoiding clipping is very
            important in digital audio.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Cross-fade</strong></span></dt><dd><p>This is a nice and common effect: A fade-out overlaps a
            fade-in. Audacity does not have a cross-fade effect, but it is
            easy to create a cross-fade using the Envelope and Time Shift
            tools. You need two tracks: Manually create a fade-out on one, a
            fade-in on the other, and then adjust the degree of overlap with
            the Time Shift tool.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>DAW</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Digital audio workstation, which is a combination

One
            decibel is one tenth of a bel, which was named for Alexander
            Graham Bell. Decibels are also used to measure voltage and signal
            strength.</p><p>In audio, a decibel is not an absolute measurement but a
            ratio between the sound we are measuring and an arbitrary
            reference level. About the smallest change we can perceive is 1
            dB. A gain of 3 dB is about twice as loud, and a reduction of 3 dB
            is about half as loud. The intensity, or amplitude, of a sound is
            not proportional to how we perceive its loudness. Loudness is a
            psychoacoustic response, and it takes about a 10 times increase in
            the intensity of a sound to make it sound twice as loud.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0117" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In digital audio, we use the <span class="emphasis"><em>decibels relative to
            full scale</em></span>, abbreviated as dBFS. Zero is the loudest we
            can go without clipping, and digital audio dB values are expressed
            as negative numbers.</p><p>You might see tables that show the decibel levels of various
            sounds from the quietest whisper a person can hear, which is zero,
            to the threshold of pain, which is usually stated as 120 dB. These
            are not like the dBFS scale we use in digital audio but the dBA
            scale, which is commonly used to measure environmental and
            industrial noise.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Discrete</strong></span></dt><dd><p>This is discrete as in separate, not
            <span class="emphasis"><em>discreet</em></span> as in able to keep one’s mouth shut.
            Most stereo systems have two discrete playback channels, and
            discrete 5.1 surround sound means six separate playback channels.
            Sometimes 5.1 surround is emulated from a stereo track, so this is
            not discrete 5.1 surround.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0118" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Downmix</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Combine multiple audio tracks into fewer tracks, as in

            be 16 bits/ 44,100 Hz sample rate, so a 48 kHz audio file must be
            downsampled to 44.1 kHz. Resampling can harm audio quality, so the
            less often you resample an audio file the better. Resampling once
            from a master file for export to different audio file formats is
            all right; if you resample the resampled file, chances are you
            will hear the difference.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0120" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>DRM</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Digital rights management, or digital restrictions

            is abbreviated as Hz. Kilohertz is kHz, megahertz is MHz, and
            gigahertz is GHz. The highest note on an 88-key piano is C8 at

            When you play a trombone or strum a guitar, every note has
            multiple harmonic frequencies, so which one is the note? It is the
            lowest frequency; that is what we call the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>pitch</em></span>, and that is what we tune our
            instruments to. Pitch is subjective rather than objective; pitch
            is what we perceive the note to be. Usually it’s pretty easy to

            Usually this is a bad idea because it can make a loud popping

            impedance. Lower impedance is better: 600 ohms or less. Medium
            impedance is 600 to 10,000 ohms, and high impedance is more than
            10,000. Some higher-end mics support multiple impedance ratings
            and have switches to select the one you want to use. When you see
            High-Z and Low-Z, that is shorthand for high impedance and low

            impedances exactly, connect your mic to an input with the same or
            higher impedance. If you go the other way, you’ll lose signal
            strength. Nothing seriously bad will happen with mismatched mic

            track at a time. Many commercial recordings are recorded in bits
            and pieces, and the performers may never be present at the same
            recording session or even use the same studio. In Audacity, you
            can record an instrument track and then play it back while you
            record a second track. There is always a bit of latency in
            overdubbing this way, so Audacity has a customizable latency
            correction.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0144" class="indexterm"/></p></dd></dl></div></div>

            transient events and are higher and more abrupt than your RMS
            levels. Peak and RMS levels are represented by two different
            shades of blue in Audacity waveforms.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Phase</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Phase is about timing, the location in time of a waveform
            relative to its beginning. When the phase of a waveform is
            nonzero, it has been moved forward or backward in time. We do this
            in Audacity with the Time Shift tool. Sound waves interact with
            each other in all kinds of complex and interesting ways, and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>phase shifting</em></span> is often used to create audio
            special effects. For example, you can create a pleasing echo by
            copying an audio track, shifting the phase of the copy a little
            bit, and mixing the copy and original back together.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0145" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0146" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Two waveforms that are exactly in phase combine their
            amplitudes and sound louder. Sounds that mix randomly may create
            totally new sounds. Two waveforms that are phase-shifted 180
            degrees relative to each other cancel each other out.
            Noise-cancellation devices do this, though with varying degrees of
            effectiveness because sounds are complex and don’t match up
            exactly. When loudspeakers are not placed correctly, you might
            hear part of the song disappear, like the lead singer sounds
            muted, because of phase shifting.</p><p>When you are placing microphones, you must take phase into
            account, especially if you are using multiple mics. For example,
            it is a common practice to use multiple mics on a drum kit, with
            some on the floor and some overhead. If they are not spaced
            correctly, they will be out of sync and create some lag or phase
            shift to cause some partial cancellation so the drums sound thin
            and weak.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Pitch</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Pitch and frequency are often thought of as being the same
            thing, but they’re not. Frequencies can be measured objectively,
            while pitch is usually subjective. The ear can be fooled, as
            demonstrated by the French composer Jean Claude Risset. Mr. Risset
            is known for creating auditory illusions such as the Risset
            rhythm, which sounds as though it is forever increasing in tempo
            when in fact it is maintaining the same tempo. The human ear
            perceives that a high pitch gets higher as it grows louder, while
            a low tone sounds as though its pitch is dropping as it gets
            louder. You can easily try this yourself by generating some sine
            tones at different frequencies in Audacity and gradually
            increasing and decreasing the volume.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0147" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0148" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0149" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0150" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0151" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0152" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0153" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0154" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In music, we think of pitch as being the musical notes, so
            we tune our instruments to a pitch of middle C, or G below C, or
            whatever the notes/pitches are.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Psychoacoustics</strong></span></dt><dd><p>The study of how humans perceive sounds. Much of our
            perception is relative; for example, going out into traffic noise
            isn’t as dramatic an event after a day of working in a noisy store
            as when leaving a quiet library. Some sounds mask other sounds,
            and so we might use white noise to mask other noise.</p><p>Audio is very subjective, and recordings can be tailored to
            take advantage of psychoacoustics. Modern high-tech hearing aids
            use psychoacoustic models to make noises sound more natural.
            Psychoacoustic models are used to make lossy audio formats such as
            MP3 and Ogg Vorbis sound better.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>RMS</strong></span></dt><dd><p>Root mean square, or the average volume of your recording
            over time. Contrast with the Peak Level, which is the highest
            volume level. Audacity represents RMS and peak levels with two
            different shades of blue in waveforms.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Sample

            converter “samples” the analog signal. The sampling rate
            determines the frequency range of your recording. Theoretically, a
            perfect digital representation of an analog audio signal is
            possible when the sampling rate is at least twice as high as the
            highest frequency in the signal. The best human hearing can hear
            up to 20–24 kHz, so a sampling rate of 40–48 kHz can
            (theoretically) reproduce the entire range of human
            hearing.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0155" class="indexterm"/></p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Tempo</strong></span></dt><dd><p>The speed of the music in beats per minute. You might have
            noticed that tempo and energy don’t always correlate with each
            other—that some songs with slow tempos have great energy, while
            some faster songs feel draggy. Try listening more closely when you
            notice this—is it some quality projected by the performers? The
            rhythm section? Is it because the song is in a minor key, or a
            major key?</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Threshold of

            warm, cold, soft, brittle, reedy, full, rich, thin, breathy,
            stout, and so on. Timbre describes the qualities that
            differentiate different instruments even when they play the same
            notes, like cellos, violas, and violins; bassoons and bass
            clarinets; or very similar instruments such as two acoustic

            and see if you can tell the difference between the two lead guitar
            players, Duane Allman and Dickey Betts. The Tiptons Sax Quartet is
            four saxophone players and a drummer, so their recordings are
            splendid for honing your listening skills. When you listen to the

            Audacity is also a single track, even though it has two discrete
            channels, because Audacity sees it as a single unit and anything
            you do to it is applied equally to both channels. When you burn an
            audio CD, you can choose TAO (track at once), which means the
            laser burns your entire track without pauses. This single CD track
            can have multiple songs, and a single song is also a track.</p></dd><dt><span class="strong"><strong>Transient

            defects. You should upsample only when you have to meet specific

            typically had a scale of 20 to +3, a moving needle, and a little
            red clipping or peak light. VU meters had a rather slow response
