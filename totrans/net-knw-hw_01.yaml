    computer into your office or your home, and everything is right there: word processing
    files, financial records, email, music and video, maybe some games, and a connection
    to the Internet. It''s all in one place. Love it or hate it, that computer has
    become an important part of the way you work and play. In fact, it''s so important
    and so convenient that you eventually decide to add another computer; it might
    be a laptop that you can carry from one place to another, or maybe a second desktop
    machine that allows more than one person to use a computer at the same time. And
    that''s when the trouble starts.'

    text file or a picture you need for a report, or a music file you want to play,
    or the modem that connects you to the Internet—is located on the other computer.
    You have to copy files to a portable disk or a flash drive when you have something
    to print and carry it to the computer connected to your printer; when you want
    to scan something you must go to the computer with the scanner; and when you want
    to connect to the Internet, you must either use the computer with the high-speed
    connection or wait until another family member has finished using the telephone
    so you can dial in. Using the computer has risen to a whole new level of inconvenience.

    something you need on *this* computer is stored on or connected to *that* computer.

    or any combination of those and other methods form a *network* that you can use
    to send and receive instructions and files from one computer to another. Whether
    you're using your computers at home, at school, in a small business, or even at
    a temporary gathering such as a business conference or a camping trip (if you're
    the sort of person who takes computers along on a camping trip), connecting them
    through a network makes every one of them more useful and more powerful. And when
    you connect your network to the Internet, every device on your local network also
    becomes connected to the Internet.

- en: When you connect two or more computers in a network, each computer becomes more
    useful. There's a rule that describes this, called *Metcalfe's Law*. Robert Metcalfe
    was the original designer of the Ethernet structure used in most modern computer
    networks; his law states that the value (or power) of a network increases in proportion
    to the square of the number of devices connected to that network. The math is
    pretty subjective, but Metcalfe's Law says that two computers connected together
    are about 4 times as useful as a single computer; if you connect 10 computers,
    the network is 100 times more powerful, and so forth.

- en: Before we begin to consider the things you can do with a computer network, it
    might be helpful to understand a few basic concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the idea of networks is not limited to computers. A network can be any
    kind of structure that connects individual objects. The highway system is a network,
    and so is the worldwide telephone system. You can use either of these networks
    to interact or communicate with other people connected to the same system. Broadcasting
    networks such as CBS and the BBC use wires, microwave radio links, and other methods
    to distribute programs from one or more studios to a large number of local stations.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two or more objects, or *nodes*, that use the network to connect them
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A set of communication *channels* that carry something—speech, TV shows, computer
    data—between or among nodes
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A set of rules that controls network traffic—on a highway, the rules might specify
    that vehicles drive on the right and pass on the left, and every car and truck
    must display a license plate to identify it; in a telephone network, the rules
    define the form and use of unique numbers (called "telephone numbers") to identify
    each node and establish connections between them. To assure that a network operates
    properly, every node and every channel must follow the rules for that particular
    network.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, every network has a maximum carrying capacity. For example, a four-lane
    Interstate highway can safely carry more cars and trucks at higher speed than
    a two-lane country road. In a communications network, the capacity of a network
    connection is the amount of information it can carry, also known as its *bandwidth*.
    Both a telephone call and an FM radio station use audio channels, but the same
    voice sounds better on the FM station because the FM channel has a greater bandwidth
    that allows more of the original information (in this case, higher audio frequencies)
    to reach your ear. In a data network, the *speed* of a network is usually shown
    in millions of bits (or megabits) per second (Mbps).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And finally, every node on a network has a name. This name might be the same
    as the name of the person who uses that node, or a description of the location
    or the type of device at that node. On some networks, the name is a number, or
    a combination of letters, numbers, and other characters that have no obvious meaning
    outside of the network (a telephone number is a good example of this type of name).
    In order to allow the network to accurately find each node, it's essential that
    every name be unique.

- en: 'The simplest kind of computer network is no network at all. If you have been
    working with multiple computers without a network, you know the routine: Every
    time you need something from a different computer, you have to store a file on
    a floppy disk, a portable drive, or a flash drive, physically carry it from one
    computer to another, and load the file onto the second computer. Sometimes you''ll
    take the file from the computer you were originally using to the one that is connected
    to the right printer. If you''ve been writing a paper on a laptop computer, you
    might want to add an image that''s stored on the desktop system''s hard drive.
    Or maybe you want to give a copy to a colleague for review or approval. Whatever
    the reason, you have to carry a copy of one or more computer files from one machine
    to another.'

    The name reflects the informal dress common in most computer centers, but if you
    and your family dress for dinner every evening, or if you're a slave to fashionable
    footwear, you can think of it as "Oxfordnet" or "Slingbacknet" or "Espadrillenet"
    instead. Whatever you choose to call it, physically carrying files from one place
    to another is often a distracting, time-consuming nuisance.
  prefs: []

- en: However, sneakernet does have its uses. When you travel, it can often be easier
    and more convenient to carry a few files with you rather than retrieve them from
    a distant computer through the Internet. If you plan to use computers in two or
    more locations, such as one at school and another at home, you might be better
    off storing the file on a small portable drive instead of hauling your laptop
    around.

    to any network. The very best way to protect your confidential data from theft
    through a network is to make sure the computer where the data is stored has no
    network access.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Sneakernet is not always the slowest way to move data from one computer to
    another. If you want to move a lot of data over a relatively short distance when
    you don''t have a high-speed data connection, it can often be faster to drive
    a handful of DVDs or a box of tapes across town than to send the same files through
    a dial-up connection or any other slow network link. It''s one of the oldest maxims
    in the world of computers and networks, but it''s still true: Never underestimate
    the bandwidth of a station wagon full of floppy disks.'

    connect two or more computers and related equipment. These links can use wires,
    radio signals, or a combination of both to move computer data (and any other information
    that can be converted to and from computer data) between any pair of network nodes.

- en: Every computer connected to a network sends and receives data through a connector
    or radio antenna. Depending on the data transfer speed and the network's specific
    requirements, the computer might use a parallel port, a serial port, an Ethernet
    port, a USB or FireWire port, or a Wi-Fi antenna. Because these connectors and
    antennas move data in both directions, they are *input/output ports* or *I/O ports*,
    but that term is more often used to describe the computer's serial and parallel
    data connectors.

    service uses a dial-up telephone line, a high-speed DSL line, a cable TV service,
    a fiber optic link, or some kind of radio link; your Internet service terminates
    in just one place, most often in a piece of electronic equipment called a *modem*
    (that's geek-speak for mo*dulator/*dem*odulator*, a device that converts between
    computer data and some other type of communications signal). If you have just
    one computer, you can connect it directly to the modem; but when you want to connect
    two or more computers to the Internet at the same time, you'll need a network.

    thinking about installing a home network. When you spend that extra money for
    a DSL or cable Internet link (or fiber optic link), you want easy access to the
    Internet from every computer in the house. When you connect your network to the
    modem through a *gateway router* (shown in [Figure 1-2](ch01s03.html#a_gateway_router_provides_a_connection
    "Figure 1-2. A gateway router provides a connection between a local area network
