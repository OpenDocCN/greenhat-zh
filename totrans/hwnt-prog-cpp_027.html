<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The computer center for a large university was located in a very old building. They were having a rather annoying problem. At night, when the operator left the room, the computer would reboot.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A computer service technician was called in and quickly discovered that the system rebooted only when the operator went to the bathroom. When he went out for a drink of water, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A series of service technicians was called in to look at the problem. A lot of diagnostic equipment was put on the computer.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally they discovered the cause of the problem. The ground in that building was connected to the water pipes. The operator weighed about 300 pounds, and when he sat on the toilet, he bent it forward a few inches, just enough to separate the pipes. This broke the connection to the ground, causing a glitch that rebooted the computer.</p>
