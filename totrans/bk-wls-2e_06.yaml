    a computer, fire it up, and connect to the network right away. No fuss, no bother
    (and no need for a book like this one). That's the way Windows ought to work;
    when Windows identifies a network adapter during startup, it should automatically
    place a Network icon on the desktop and configure all of the settings your computer
    needs to make a connection.

    wireless network, you will probably have to tell Windows exactly how and where
    to find the network and how to connect to the Internet through the wireless LAN.
    This chapter explains the general principles involved in making Windows work with
    a wireless LAN and the specific procedures you will need to configure the networking
    tools and features in different versions of Windows. This is tedious, nitpicky
    stuff, but it will eliminate a lot of grief when your network connection doesn't
    work properly.

    to happen automatically if your network adapter contains firmware compatible with
    Microsoft's automatic configuration tool. Most of the latest Wi-Fi adapters come
    with drivers that work with the Windows XP tools, but you might have to download
    an updated version to use your adapter with Vista. If your computer does not automatically
    recognize an adapter, look for device driver software on the manufacturer's website.

    trouble with wireless. As far as Windows is concerned, a wireless adapter is just
    one more type of network interface that exchanges data with applications and the
    operating system. Up through Windows 2000, the "wireless" stuff happens someplace
    else; in XP, there's a separate tab for wireless-specific settings, as shown in
    [Figure 6-1](ch06.html#the_wireless_network_connection_window_i "Figure 6-1. The
    Wireless Network Connection window includes a Wireless Networks tab."). Configuring
    Windows for wireless is a matter of making this particular computer aware that
    it's connected to a network and setting the addresses of the network servers and
    services.

    system with a unique address for every device connected to the Internet. Numeric
    IP addresses always appear as four groups of numbers between 0 and 255, so the
    total universe of IP addresses runs from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255\. These numbers
    are sometimes called *octets* because they use eight binary digits (binary 11111111

    on a LAN can share one public interface through a mechanism known as Network Address

    a different IP address to every client device on the network. The server assigns
    an address to each client device whenever the client joins the network, so the

    that's why it's called *dynamic host configuration*.

    must assign a permanent address to each client. If your network manager assigns
    addresses manually, keep a copy of the address in a text file with a backup copy

    list of addresses as you assign them.
