- en: The idea of hacking may conjure stylized images of electronic vandalism, espionage,
    dyed hair, and body piercings. Most people associate hacking with breaking the
    law and assume that everyone who engages in hacking activities is a criminal.
    Granted, there are people out there who use hacking techniques to break the law,
    but hacking isn't really about that. In fact, hacking is more about following
    the law than breaking it. The essence of hacking is finding unintended or overlooked
    uses for the laws and properties of a given situation and then applying them in
    new and inventive ways to solve a problem—whatever it may be.

  zh: 破译这个概念可能会让人联想到电子破坏、间谍活动、染发和身体穿孔等夸张的形象。大多数人将黑客行为与违法联系起来，并认为从事黑客活动的人都是罪犯。诚然，确实有使用黑客技术违法的人，但黑客行为实际上并非如此。事实上，黑客行为更多的是关于遵守法律而非违反法律。黑客的本质在于发现给定情境中法律和特性的未预期或被忽视的用途，然后以新颖和创造性的方式应用它们来解决任何问题。

  zh: 以下数学问题阐述了黑客的本质：
- en: Use each of the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6 exactly once with any of the four basic
    math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to total
    24\. Each number must be used once and only once, and you may define the order
    of operations; for example, 3 * (4 + 6) + 1 = 31 is valid, however incorrect,
    since it doesn't total 24.

  zh: 使用数字1、3、4和6，通过四种基本数学运算（加法、减法、乘法和除法）正好得到24。每个数字必须使用一次，并且可以定义运算顺序；例如，3 * (4 +
    6) + 1 = 31是有效的，尽管它是错误的，因为它没有得到24。
- en: The rules for this problem are well defined and simple, yet the answer eludes
    many. Like the solution to this problem (shown on the last page of this book),
    hacked solutions follow the rules of the system, but they use those rules in counterintuitive
    ways. This gives hackers their edge, allowing them to solve problems in ways unimaginable
    for those confined to conventional thinking and methodologies.

  zh: 这个问题的规则定义明确且简单，但答案却让许多人感到困惑。就像本书最后一页所示的这个问题的解决方案一样，黑客解决方案遵循系统的规则，但以反直觉的方式使用这些规则。这赋予了黑客优势，使他们能够以那些受限于传统思维和方法的人无法想象的方式解决问题。
- en: Since the infancy of computers, hackers have been creatively solving problems.
    In the late 1950s, the MIT model railroad club was given a donation of parts,
    mostly old telephone equipment. The club's members used this equipment to rig
    up a complex system that allowed multiple operators to control different parts
    of the track by dialing in to the appropriate sections. They called this new and
    inventive use of telephone equipment *hacking* ; many people consider this group
    to be the original hackers. The group moved on to programming on punch cards and
    ticker tape for early computers like the IBM 704 and the TX-0\. While others were
    content with writing programs that just solved problems, the early hackers were
    obsessed with writing programs that solved problems *well*. A new program that
    could achieve the same result as an existing one but used fewer punch cards was
    considered better, even though it did the same thing. The key difference was how
    the program achieved its results—*elegance*.

  zh: 自从计算机的幼年期开始，黑客们就富有创意地解决问题。在20世纪50年代末，麻省理工学院的模型铁路俱乐部收到了一批零件的捐赠，主要是旧电话设备。俱乐部的成员使用这些设备搭建了一个复杂的系统，允许多个操作员通过拨打电话到适当的区域来控制轨道的不同部分。他们将这种对电话设备的创新使用称为“黑客”；许多人认为这个团体是原始黑客。该团体后来转向为像IBM
    704和TX-0这样的早期计算机编写穿孔卡片和纸带程序。当其他人满足于编写仅解决问题的程序时，早期的黑客们着迷于编写解决问题的程序“好”。一个新程序如果能以相同的结果替代现有的程序，但使用的穿孔卡片更少，就被认为更好，尽管它做了同样的事情。关键的区别在于程序实现结果的方式——*优雅*。
- en: Being able to reduce the number of punch cards needed for a program showed an
    artistic mastery over the computer. A nicely crafted table can hold a vase just
    as well as a milk crate can, but one sure looks a lot better than the other. Early
    hackers proved that technical problems can have artistic solutions, and they thereby
    transformed programming from a mere engineering task into an art form.

  zh: 能够减少程序所需的穿孔卡片数量显示了在计算机上的艺术掌握。一张精心制作的桌子可以像牛奶箱一样容纳花瓶，但一个看起来肯定比另一个好得多。早期的黑客证明了技术问题可以有艺术解决方案，因此他们把编程从一项单纯的工程任务转变为一种艺术形式。
- en: Like many other forms of art, hacking was often misunderstood. The few who got
    it formed an informal subculture that remained intensely focused on learning and
    mastering their art. They believed that information should be free and anything
    that stood in the way of that freedom should be circumvented. Such obstructions
    included authority figures, the bureaucracy of college classes, and discrimination.
    In a sea of graduation-driven students, this unofficial group of hackers defied
    conventional goals and instead pursued knowledge itself. This drive to continually
    learn and explore transcended even the conventional boundaries drawn by discrimination,
    evident in the MIT model railroad club's acceptance of 12-year-old Peter Deutsch
    when he demonstrated his knowledge of the TX-0 and his desire to learn. Age, race,
    gender, appearance, academic degrees, and social status were not primary criteria
    for judging another's worth—not because of a desire for equality, but because
    of a desire to advance the emerging art of hacking.

  zh: 与许多其他艺术形式一样，黑客行为常常被误解。少数理解它的人形成了一个非正式的亚文化群体，他们始终专注于学习和掌握自己的艺术。他们认为信息应该是自由的，任何阻碍这种自由的东西都应该被绕过。这些障碍包括权威人物、大学课程的官僚主义和歧视。在以毕业为导向的学生海洋中，这个非官方的黑客群体挑战了传统目标，转而追求知识本身。这种不断学习和探索的驱动力甚至超越了由歧视划定的传统界限，这在麻省理工学院模型铁路俱乐部接受12岁的彼得·德奇时表现得尤为明显，当时他展示了他在TX-0上的知识和他学习的愿望。年龄、种族、性别、外貌、学术学位和社会地位并不是判断他人价值的主要标准——不是因为追求平等，而是因为希望推动新兴黑客艺术的进步。
- en: 'The original hackers found splendor and elegance in the conventionally dry
    sciences of math and electronics. They saw programming as a form of artistic expression
    and the computer as an instrument of that art. Their desire to dissect and understand
    wasn''t intended to demystify artistic endeavors; it was simply a way to achieve
    a greater appreciation of them. These knowledge-driven values would eventually
    be called the *Hacker Ethic*: the appreciation of logic as an art form and the
    promotion of the free flow of information, surmounting conventional boundaries
    and restrictions for the simple goal of better understanding the world. This is
    not a new cultural trend; the Pythagoreans in ancient Greece had a similar ethic
    and subculture, despite not owning computers. They saw beauty in mathematics and
    discovered many core concepts in geometry. That thirst for knowledge and its beneficial
    byproducts would continue on through history, from the Pythagoreans to Ada Lovelace
    to Alan Turing to the hackers of the MIT model railroad club. Modern hackers like
    Richard Stallman and Steve Wozniak have continued the hacking legacy, bringing
    us modern operating systems, programming languages, personal computers, and many
    other technologies that we use every day.'

  zh: 最初的黑客们在传统的枯燥科学——数学和电子学中找到了辉煌和优雅。他们将编程视为一种艺术形式，将计算机视为这种艺术的工具。他们想要剖析和理解，并不是为了使艺术活动变得神秘，而仅仅是为了更好地欣赏它们。这些以知识为驱动的价值观最终被称为“黑客伦理”：对逻辑作为一种艺术形式的欣赏，以及对信息自由流动的促进，超越传统的界限和限制，以达到更好地理解世界的简单目标。这并非一种新的文化趋势；古希腊的毕达哥拉斯学派就有类似的伦理和亚文化，尽管他们没有拥有计算机。他们看到了数学中的美，并发现了几何学中的许多核心概念。这种对知识的渴望及其有益的副产品将继续贯穿历史，从毕达哥拉斯学派到阿达·洛芙莱斯，再到艾伦·图灵，再到麻省理工学院模型铁路俱乐部的黑客们。像理查德·斯托尔曼和史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克这样的现代黑客继续着黑客的遗产，为我们带来了现代操作系统、编程语言、个人电脑以及我们每天使用的许多其他技术。
- en: How does one distinguish between the good hackers who bring us the wonders of
    technological advancement and the evil hackers who steal our credit card numbers?
    The term *cracker* was coined to distinguish evil hackers from the good ones.
    Journalists were told that crackers were supposed to be the bad guys, while hackers
    were the good guys. Hackers stayed true to the Hacker Ethic, while crackers were
    only interested in breaking the law and making a quick buck. Crackers were considered
    to be much less talented than the elite hackers, as they simply made use of hacker-written
    tools and scripts without understanding how they worked. *Cracker* was meant to
    be the catch-all label for anyone doing anything unscrupulous with a computer—
    pirating software, defacing websites, and worst of all, not understanding what
    they were doing. But very few people use this term today.

  zh: 如何区分那些带来科技进步奇迹的好黑客和那些窃取我们信用卡号码的坏黑客呢？术语“cracker”被创造出来以区分坏黑客和好黑客。记者们被告知，crackers应该是坏人，而hackers是好人。黑客们忠于黑客伦理，而crackers只对违法和快速赚钱感兴趣。由于crackers只是简单地利用黑客编写的工具和脚本，而不理解它们是如何工作的，因此被认为比精英黑客的才能要少得多。*Cracker*原本是用来指代任何用计算机进行不道德行为的人——盗版软件、破坏网站，最糟糕的是，不理解他们在做什么。但如今，几乎没有人使用这个术语。
- en: 'The term''s lack of popularity might be due to its confusing etymology— *cracker*
    originally described those who crack software copyrights and reverse engineer
    copy-protection schemes. Its current unpopularity might simply result from its
    two ambiguous new definitions: a group of people who engage in illegal activity
    with computers or people who are relatively unskilled hackers. Few technology
    journalists feel compelled to use terms that most of their readers are unfamiliar
    with. In contrast, most people are aware of the mystery and skill associated with
    the term *hacker*, so for a journalist, the decision to use the term *hacker*
    is easy. Similarly, the term *script kiddie* is sometimes used to refer to crackers,
    but it just doesn''t have the same zing as the shadowy *hacker*. There are some
    who will still argue that there is a distinct line between hackers and crackers,
    but I believe that anyone who has the hacker spirit is a hacker, despite any laws
    he or she may break.'

  zh: 这个术语不受欢迎可能是因为它的词源令人困惑——*cracker*最初描述的是破解软件版权和逆向工程版权保护方案的人。它目前的不受欢迎可能仅仅是因为它有两个含糊不清的新定义：一群使用计算机进行非法活动的人或相对不太熟练的黑客。很少有技术记者觉得有必要使用大多数读者都不熟悉的术语。相比之下，大多数人都能意识到与*hacker*一词相关的神秘和技能，因此对于记者来说，使用*hacker*这个术语的决定是容易的。同样，术语*script
    kiddie*有时也用来指代crackers，但它并没有像神秘的*hacker*那样有吸引力。有些人仍然会争论黑客和crackers之间有一条明显的界限，但我相信，任何拥有黑客精神的人都是黑客，尽管他们可能违反了法律。
- en: The current laws restricting cryptography and cryptographic research further
    blur the line between hackers and crackers. In 2001, Professor Edward Felten and
    his research team from Princeton University were about to publish a paper that
    discussed the weaknesses of various digital watermarking schemes. This paper responded
    to a challenge issued by the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) in the SDMI
    Public Challenge, which encouraged the public to attempt to break these watermarking
    schemes. Before Felten and his team could publish the paper, though, they were
    threatened by both the SDMI Foundation and the Recording Industry Association
    of America (RIAA). The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) of 1998 makes it
    illegal to discuss or provide technology that might be used to bypass industry
    consumer controls. This same law was used against Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian computer
    programmer and hacker. He had written software to circumvent overly simplistic
    encryption in Adobe software and presented his findings at a hacker convention
    in the United States. The FBI swooped in and arrested him, leading to a lengthy
    legal battle. Under the law, the complexity of the industry consumer controls
    doesn't matter—it would be technically illegal to reverse engineer or even discuss
    Pig Latin if it were used as an industry consumer control. Who are the hackers
    and who are the crackers now? When laws seem to interfere with free speech, do
    the good guys who speak their minds suddenly become bad? I believe that the spirit
    of the hacker transcends governmental laws, as opposed to being defined by them.

  zh: 当前限制密码学和密码学研究的相关法律进一步模糊了黑客和破解者的界限。2001年，普林斯顿大学的Edward Felten教授及其研究团队即将发表一篇论文，讨论各种数字水印方案的弱点。这篇论文是对SDMI（Secure
    Digital Music Initiative）在SDMI公共挑战中提出的挑战的回应，该挑战鼓励公众尝试破解这些水印方案。然而，在Felten及其团队能够发表这篇论文之前，他们遭到了SDMI基金会和美国录音工业协会（RIAA）的威胁。1998年的《数字千年版权法》（DMCA）规定，讨论或提供可能被用于绕过行业消费者控制的技术是非法的。同样的法律被用来对付俄罗斯计算机程序员和黑客Dmitry
    Sklyarov。他编写了软件来绕过Adobe软件中过于简单的加密，并在美国的一个黑客大会上展示了他的发现。FBI介入并逮捕了他，导致了一场漫长的法律斗争。根据该法律，行业消费者控制的复杂性并不重要——如果它被用作行业消费者控制，那么逆向工程或甚至讨论猪拉丁语都将被视为技术上的非法行为。现在谁是黑客，谁是破解者？当法律似乎干涉言论自由时，那些敢于直言的人突然变成了坏人吗？我相信黑客精神超越了政府法律，而不是由它们来定义。
- en: The sciences of nuclear physics and biochemistry can be used to kill, yet they
    also provide us with significant scientific advancement and modern medicine. There's
    nothing good or bad about knowledge itself; morality lies in the application of
    knowledge. Even if we wanted to, we couldn't suppress the knowledge of how to
    convert matter into energy or stop the continued technological progress of society.
    In the same way, the hacker spirit can never be stopped, nor can it be easily
    categorized or dissected. Hackers will constantly be pushing the limits of knowledge
    and acceptable behavior, forcing us to explore further and further.

- en: Part of this drive results in an ultimately beneficial co-evolution of security
    through competition between attacking hackers and defending hackers. Just as the
    speedy gazelle adapted from being chased by the cheetah, and the cheetah became
    even faster from chasing the gazelle, the competition between hackers provides
    computer users with better and stronger security, as well as more complex and
    sophisticated attack techniques. The introduction and progression of intrusion
    detection systems (IDSs) is a prime example of this co-evolutionary process. The
    defending hackers create IDSs to add to their arsenal, while the attacking hackers
    develop IDS-evasion techniques, which are eventually compensated for in bigger
    and better IDS products. The net result of this interaction is positive, as it
    produces smarter people, improved security, more stable software, inventive problem-solving
    techniques, and even a new economy.

  zh: 这部分动力导致了一个最终有益的通过攻击黑客和防御黑客之间的竞争而产生的安全协同进化。正如快速的长颈鹿适应了被猎豹追逐，而猎豹通过追逐长颈鹿变得更加强壮一样，黑客之间的竞争为计算机用户提供了更好、更强大的安全，以及更复杂和高级的攻击技术。入侵检测系统（IDSs）的引入和进步是这个协同进化过程的典型例子。防御黑客创建IDS来增强他们的武器库，而攻击黑客则开发IDS规避技术，这些技术最终在更大、更好的IDS产品中得到补偿。这种互动的净结果是积极的，因为它产生了更聪明的人、改进的安全、更稳定的软件、创新的解决问题的技术，甚至是一个新的经济体系。

    them to learn how and why they work. Included with this book is a bootable LiveCD
    containing all the source code used herein as well as a preconfigured Linux environment.
    Exploration and innovation are critical to the art of hacking, so this CD will
    let you follow along and experiment on your own. The only requirement is an *x*86
    processor, which is used by all Microsoft Windows machines and the newer Macintosh
    computers—just insert the CD and reboot. This alternate Linux environment will
    not disturb your existing OS, so when you're done, just reboot again and remove
    the CD. This way, you will gain a hands-on understanding and appreciation for
    hacking that may inspire you to improve upon existing techniques or even to invent
    new ones. Hopefully, this book will stimulate the curious hacker nature in you
    and prompt you to contribute to the art of hacking in some way, regardless of
    which side of the fence you choose to be on.
