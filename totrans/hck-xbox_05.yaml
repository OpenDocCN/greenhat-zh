- en: In the unfortunate (and surprisingly common) event that an Xbox breaks after
    its three month warranty period expires, the only official way to fix it is to
    pay Microsoft for the repair bill. Even the simplest fixes can cost over one hundred
    dollars, or about half the original purchase price of the console. As a result,
    I have received numerous emails from people asking how to fix broken power supplies
    and hard drives.

- en: Unfortunately, replacing a broken hard drive requires defeating the Xbox security
    system, since a unique key is used to lock Xbox motherboards to a particular hard
    drive. Installing a new hard drive would require a modchip that can reprogram
    or bypass the hard drive lock. Furthermore, a copy of the factory-installed Xbox
    software is required, something that is illegal to distribute or copy even for
    repair purposes. Therefore, the topic of Xbox hard drive replacement is too dicey
    to be discussed in this text. Readers are encouraged to search online for any
    of the numerous FAQs about replacing hard drives.

    a standard PC ATX power supply for the Xbox. The approach described in this section
    requires no soldering, at the expense of having to flip an extra switch to power
    on the Xbox. Appendix C, “Getting Into PCB Layout,” describes a simple project
    that you can build to have the convenience of no additional power switches. Of
    course, it is easier to purchase an exact replacement power supply for the Xbox
    and use parts of the procedure presented in this chapter to help you with the
    installation. However, there is less educational value in doing a direct replacement
    than in doing an adaptation. If you decide to adapt the ATX power supply for use
    with the Xbox, you will learn how to make crimp cables as well as learn a little
    bit about electronics theory and how the Xbox works.

- en: Another reason for adapting a standard PC ATX power supply to the Xbox is to
    provide extra power to the console. The OEM (original equipment manufacturer)
    or “stock” Xbox power supply puts out just barely enough power to meet the Xbox’s
    demands. Connecting extra drives or fans to an otherwise unmodified Xbox can overload
    the OEM Xbox power supply and cause it to burn out.

- en: Note that as of this writing, a new hardware revision of the Xbox (known as
    “v1.2” in the Xbox hacking community) was released that *appears* to have a standard
    ATX power supply connector, instead of the proprietary Xbox power supply connector
    described later in this chapter. Check to make sure that your Xbox power supply
    connector matches the connector described in this chapter before proceeding with
    the adaptation procedure. The Xbox power supply connector assumed in this chapter
    has twelve pins in a single row, whereas the newer Xbox power supply connector
    has 20 pins arranged in two rows of ten. Also, even though the latest Xbox hardware
    revision has an ATX-like connector, it is not necessarily electrically compatible
    with a standard ATX power supply. It would be prudent to measure the voltages
    on the power connector and compare them to the ATX specification (www.formfactors.org/developer/specs/atx/atx2_1.pdf)
    before attempting to mate a standard ATX power supply to an Xbox with the new
    ATX-like connector.

    and any of the black wires on the power connector. You can measure power supply
    voltages by inserting the tips of a voltmeter probe into the free space between
    the power wires and the power connector. (There is a metal collar around the power
    wires inside the motherboard power connector’s body.) If the value of 3.3VSB is

    measure each of the primary voltages coming from the power supply. The yellow
    wire should have a voltage between 11.4 to 12.6 volts; the red wire should have
    between 4.8 to 5.25 volts; and the orange wire should have between 3.14 to 3.47
    volts. (All of these voltages are referenced with respect to the black wire.)

    outputs a +5V standby supply voltage. The “correct” solution to this problem would
    be to use a voltage regulator that precisely converts +5V into +3.3V, but the
    goal of this hack is to replace the power supply with a minimal amount of soldering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The alternate solution is to use two diodes to reduce a +5 volt supply down
    to a “close enough” +3.6 volt supply. We can do this because the voltage across
    a forward conducting diode is logarithmically proportional to the current through
    the diode. In other words, for most currents, the voltage across a diode is almost
    constant. It turns out that silicon diodes almost uniformly have a forward voltage
    drop of about 0.7 volts, so two of them in series will drop 1.4 volts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diodes used in this hack, the 1N4001, are only capable of conducting 1 ampere
    of current, so don’t use this trick in other applications that require a large
    amount of current. Fortunately, the stand-by supply for the Xbox only needs to
    draw a tiny amount of current so burning out the diodes is not a concern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a final note, the voltage dropped by a diode fluctuates slightly with the
    amount of current through it, so do not use this trick in applications that require
    precisely regulated voltages. In the Xbox application, we are running the voltage
    a little bit on the high side, but fortunately the digital logic powered off of
    this supply can tolerate this condition.

- en: The interface for a standard ATX power supply is very similar to that of an
    Xbox’s power supply. The Xbox requires +3.3V, +5V, +12V, a +3.3V standby supply,
    as well as two control signals, “power OK” and “power on.” The power OK signal
    indicates that the power output from the power supply is stable and properly regulated,
    and the Power On signal is a control signal from the Xbox that turns the power
    supply on and off. A typical ATX supply has +3.3V, +5V, and +12V outputs with
    enough juice to run an Xbox, and it also has a power OK signal that is compatible
    with the Xbox motherboard. However, an ATX power supply generates a +5V standby
    voltage instead of a +3.3V standby voltage, and the Power On signal has an inverted
    polarity from the Xbox. Both of these incompatibilities can be addressed in a
    manner that requires no soldering. Two diodes in series are used to reduce the
    +5V standby voltage down to a voltage of a little less than +3.6V. The Power On
    signal to the ATX power supply defaults to “on,” so it will remain unconnected,
    making the power supply always on even if the console is off. This isn’t problematic
    for the console’s electronics, but it might be aesthetically disconcerting. Appendix
    C, “Getting Into PCB Layout,” describes a sample design that you can implement
    to avoid these incompatibilities in a more graceful manner. However, the design
    outlined in the appendix will require you to invest some effort in the form of
    soldering and board design.

    has no heatsink fan over the GPU. See the Caution note on the facing page describing
    this problem. To fix this problem, you may need to add an extra fan or enhance
    the existing ducting system with a piece of paper and some sticky tape.
