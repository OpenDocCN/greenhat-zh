    you can not only transform but also style (choose fill or stroke, adjust opacity,
    apply filters, etc.) a text object as a whole without even going into the Text
    tool (and, of course, without losing the ability to edit the text). However, only

    font family and font size) as well as apply style to *spans* (fragments) of a
