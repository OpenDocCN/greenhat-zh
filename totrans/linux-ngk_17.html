</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">These days, almost all operating systems are,  at least to some degree, multilingual or  capable of becoming so. This is true of Linux as well. Just open your Web browser and you  can read, without performing any special  installations, pages in any European language, including  those with Cyrillic alphabets, such as Russian. You can  even view pages in Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Arabic, and  Hebrew, to name but a few, with only a tad more effort. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">But the multilingual capabilities of Linux are much greater than this, and the  way that Fedora Core has things set up makes it quite easy to take advantage of these  capabilities. As you will soon see, you can even set up your system to give you a totally  foreign language environment, allowing you to function completely in the language  of your choice. Add to this the ever-expanding number of free programs available for  language study, and you have a truly meaningful language-learning tool.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If all you want is to be able to read Web pages or documents written in a foreign  language, you don’t need to install any additional language support. In fact, it is  possible that you won’t have to do anything at all, depending, of course, on the  language in question.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Documents or Web pages written in the Roman alphabet, such as Swedish,  Italian, Malaysian, or Tagalog require no additional moves on your part. If in  <a href="DDU0118_split_000.html#710" target="_parent">Chapter 16</a> you installed one of the Microsoft TrueType Core Fonts (specifically  Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman), you will also be able to read pages and documents written in many other languages that use the Roman alphabet  but that require special diacritics, such as Vietnamese, as well as languages with  alphabetic writing systems that are not Roman, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, or  the Cyrillic-based languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, and Bulgarian).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">For other languages, however, you will probably have to install fonts for that  language. When you come upon a page written in a language for which you have  no font support, the text will be displayed as odd symbols, like the Hindi page  shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU171">Figure 17-1</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Other than Hindi, the languages that will most likely require you to install  specific font packages are Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. These fonts are  all included on Install Disk 2. You can find the fonts by double-clicking the  <b class="calibre13">Fedora</b> folder on that disk (the<b class="calibre13"> RedHat</b> folder, if you are using  Red Hat Linux 9  instead of the disks included with this book), and then the <b class="calibre13">RPMS</b> folder within that. Once you have found the fonts, copy the font package you want to the  Tarballs_and_RPMs folder on your hard disk. The filenames for these fonts  begin with <b class="calibre13">ttfonts</b>: </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you prefer (or need) to, you can download and install any or all of these  fonts with Synaptic/APT. To do this, just type <span>ttfonts</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Find </b>box in the main  Synaptic window. Once you’ve done that, click the search arrow next to that box.  You can then select the fonts you wish to install from the list that Synaptic  produces as the result of your search.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Typing characters that are not standard in English, such as é, ç, ß, ø, æ, and å,  can be done quite easily in Linux without any modifications. In most situations,  you can do this by using the Unicode Character Map utility included in your  system, which can be found in the Main menu under <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Unicode  Character Map</b>. A window, like the one shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU173">Figure 17-3</a>, will then appear.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To input the character you want, just select the language or character set in the  left pane of the window, and then, in the right pane, click the character you want  to input. The character will then appear in the little input box at the bottom of  the window in the <b class="calibre13">Text to copy</b> box. Just click the <b class="calibre13">Copy</b> button and then paste  the character wherever you want to place it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In certain applications, such as OpenOffice.org, this method will not work. In these cases, the program most often offers a method of its own. In  OpenOffice.org, for example, you can click <b class="calibre13">Insert </b>in the menu bar and then  select <b class="calibre13">Special Character</b>. A selection window will open, and you can select the  character you want there. Once you’ve done that, click the <b class="calibre13">OK</b> button, and the  character will appear in your document, after which the selection window will  close by itself.<a name="769" id="769"/><a name="IDX-240" id="IDX-240"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you often type in a particular foreign language, it might be more convenient  for you to use the <b class="calibre13">Keyboard Layout Switcher</b> GNOME Panel utility. This utility  lets you switch quickly among various keyboard layouts. For example, if you often  type in Swedish, and thus use the characters å, ä, and ö quite often, using the  appropriate keyboard layout would be easier than repeatedly using the Unicode  Character Map. Of course, you will have to familiarize yourself with the keyboard  layout, or <i class="calibre11">keymap</i>, for each language you choose, but this is a relatively easy task. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Keyboard Layout Switcher is already included in your system, so there is  no need to install it. To access it, simply right-click somewhere on the GNOME  Panel where you would like to place a launcher for it. Then, from the pop-up  menu select <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Utility </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Keyboard Layout Switcher</b>. A small icon that  looks like a keycap with an American flag on it will appear in the panel. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, this alone will give you nothing except your default keymap, so you  must configure Keyboard Layout Switcher if you want to be able to use other  keymaps. To do so, just right-click the icon, and from the pop-up menu select  <b class="calibre13">Preferences</b>, which will open the Preferences window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To add a keymap, click on the <b class="calibre13">Add</b> button on the right side of the window. After you do this, another window with a list of keymaps will open up. Scroll  down to the keymap for the language you want to add, and then click it. The  keymaps available for that language will then appear; simply select the keymap  you want, as shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU174">Figure 17-4</a>. When one is available, it is usually best to  choose the <b class="calibre13">xkb</b> layout, as it is usually coded with the most options (right-to-left  text input in Arabic or Hebrew, for example).</p>

This will leave you with the main Preferences window, which will  then show your new keymap installed. After closing the Preferences window, the  keyboard layouts can be changed by clicking the icon in the Panel. You can also  change between keyboard layouts by going to the <b class="calibre13">Options</b> tab of the Preferences  window and assigning a keyboard shortcut.<a name="772" id="772"/><a name="IDX-241" id="IDX-241"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you just want to choose a single keyboard layout to replace your present  one (such as British English instead of American English or German instead of  Spanish), you can do so by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">System Settings  </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Keyboard</b>. You will first be asked for your root password and then you will see a  list of keyboard layouts that you can choose from.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the many things that originally attracted me to the Linux world was being  able to install language support for languages other than English. On one of my  machines, I have installed support for Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, and my  default, English. With just a simple logout and a few more clicks, I can log back in  with an interface in a totally different language. I can have a Chinese system or a  Japanese system or a Swedish system whenever I want. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This is very useful if you are going to be doing a lot of work in a foreign  language, or even if you are studying a foreign language and want to give yourself  as much exposure as possible to that language. It is also very handy when you  have users with different native languages using the same machine. At my university, for example, where my Japanese and Chinese students sometimes use  my computer, the additional language support allows them to log in using their  own language. All in all, it is a very useful feature.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Taking advantage of this feature in the GNOME environment is very easy  and, depending on the language you wish to use, it may require little to no  special installation measures. The rule of thumb is essentially the same as for the  read-only language support I mentioned earlier — if you want to view your entire  system in languages with Roman-based writing systems (French, Spanish, Danish,  German, Malaysian, and so on), then you don’t have to do anything. And once  you have installed one of the Microsoft TrueType Core Fonts, you are ready for  all those languages with non-Roman writing systems I mentioned earlier as well.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Support for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean is another matter. The writing  systems of these three languages are sufficiently complex as to require not only  the installation of the appropriate fonts, but also the installation of a fair number  of other applications to handle the input and conversion processes. Whenever  possible, it is best to install additional language support for these languages  during the initial system installation process described in <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a>. If you have  already installed your system without support for these languages, but would like  to add it without having to reinstall your whole system again, check out the Web  page for this book (<a target="_top" href="http://www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks">www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks</a>) for information on what  packages you will need to install. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Note that if you are going to be using KDE as your desktop environment in  the future (or if you are already doing so on the sly), you will also need to install  special KDE language files for each language you want login support for. You can  find the appropriate RPM files in the RPMS folder of Install Disk X. The files will  all have names like kde-i18n-Czech, kde-i18n-Arabic, and so on. If you prefer, you  can use Synaptic/APT instead to add such support. To do this, just type <span>kde-i</span> in  the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box of the main Synaptic window, and then choose from the list of  results for the language you want to install.<a name="774" id="774"/><a name="IDX-242" id="IDX-242"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Logging in to your computer in another language is really easy. The first thing  you’ll have to do is get to your login screen. You can do this by starting up your  computer as always and waiting for the login screen to appear, or, if you are  already up and running, by selecting <b class="calibre13">Log Out</b> in your Main panel menu. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you are at your login screen, click the word <b class="calibre13">Language</b> at the bottom  left corner of the screen. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A window with a list of all the languages available, even the ones you didn’t  install, will then pop up. From that list, click the language that you want to use  (provided you have already installed it, of course), and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. The  language-list window will then close automatically, and you can proceed as usual  by typing in your login name and password (each followed by pressing the ENTER key, of course). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">A little window will then pop up asking you if you want to use the language  you’ve chosen as your default language forever and ever. You can either click <b class="calibre13">Just  for This Session</b> or <b class="calibre13">Make Default</b> depending on your personal preferences.  Whatever you do end up choosing, fear not; it’s no big deal to change back at a  later point in time by logging out of your system, logging back in to your system  under your previous default language, and clicking <b class="calibre13">Make Default</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Your startup process will then continue, and everything will progress as it  usually does. Depending on what language you’ve chosen, once your desktop  appears you will be in another linguistic world. Your menus, desktop icon  captions, and even the little Tips windows that pop up when you run your mouse  over a Panel icon, will all be in the selected language. (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU175">Figure 17-5</a> shows the  Trash and Start Here icons in a variety of languages.) Most applications you open  will also appear with menus and buttons in that language. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This section only applies to those of you who have installed Chinese, Japanese, or  Korean as additional languages, or those who are planning or thinking about  doing so. Of course, you can also read on if you’re just curious about such things. I include this special section on these languages because they are a bit more  complex to use than others. <a name="778" id="778"/><a name="IDX-243" id="IDX-243"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Unlike most European languages and many other alphabet-based non- European languages, such as Thai, Arabic, and Hindi, where pressing a letter on  the keyboard prints that letter to the screen, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean  require a kind of conversion process, which is handled by a special application (actually a set of applications) called an Input Method Editor (IME). Of course,  this is a Windows-world term, but I will use it for convenience’s sake. In any case, each language has its own IME, and Fedora automatically installs the appropriate  IME for each of the languages you choose to install. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Although Chinese, Japanese, and Korean all require the use of an IME to get  words onto the screen, the way each operates is unique due to the different  writing systems of each language.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While most people (at least those in the linguistic know) would think that  Chinese would be the most complicated system, due to the fact that the writing  system consists of thousands of characters, it is in fact the simplest. The Chinese  IME simply takes the Romanized keyboard input, known as <i class="calibre11">pinyin</i>, and converts  it into Chinese characters, or <i class="calibre11">Hanzi. </i>For the IME, it is essentially a simple dictionary lookup task — big dictionaries, simple IME.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Here are some tips for using the Chinese IME:</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Japanese IME has a considerably more complicated task to perform, as it has  three writing systems to deal with: <i class="calibre11">Kanji </i>(ideographic characters borrowed long  ago from China), the phono-alphabetic <i class="calibre11">hiragana</i> (used mainly for tense and case  endings), and <i class="calibre11">katakana </i>(used mainly for words borrowed from other languages).  Still, the standard input method for Japanese is primarily via the standard Roman  keyboard layout, plus a few extra special-function keys. Thus, typing in Japanese  is a two-step process whereby the IME first converts the Romanized text into  <i class="calibre11">hiragana </i>as it is typed , and then converts it to appropriate <i class="calibre11">Kanji</i>, <i class="calibre11">katakana,</i> or  <i class="calibre11">hiragana</i> elements after the SPACE bar is pressed. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can see an example of these steps in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU176">Figure 17-6</a>.</p>

In the second line, the user has pressed the SPACE bar, which caused the IME to convert the <i class="calibre11">hiragana</i> string into the appropriate  <i class="calibre11">Kanji, hiragana, </i>and <i class="calibre11">katakana</i> elements. The first word, “Linux,” has been  converted to <i class="calibre11">katakana </i>text, as it is a borrowed word, while “Japanese input” and  “can” have been converted to<i class="calibre11"> Kanji;</i> the rest stays in <i class="calibre11">hiragana</i>. <a name="782" id="782"/><a name="IDX-244" id="IDX-244"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The job of the Korean IME is again quite different from that of the Chinese  and Japanese IMEs, as the language itself is written in a very different way.  Korean is written either entirely in alphabetic letters, called <i class="calibre11">Hangul,</i> or in a combination of <i class="calibre11">Hangul</i> and ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese called  <i class="calibre11">Hanja</i>. While the <i class="calibre11">Hanja</i> are essentially the same as their Chinese and Japanese  counterparts, <i class="calibre11">Hanzi </i>and <i class="calibre11">Kanji</i>, the Korean phonetic alphabet, <i class="calibre11">Hangul,</i> has it own  unique appearance, as you can see in the Korean word for Korea, <i class="calibre11">Hangug(k)</i>, in  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU177">Figure 17-7</a>.</p>

</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This seems quite simple; however, the representation is not quite correct, as  Korean is quite unique in the way that its alphabetic characters are put to the  page. Unlike the usual side-by-side positioning of <i class="calibre11">hiragana</i>, <i class="calibre11">katakana</i>, and most  other languages written with an alphabet, <i class="calibre11">Hangul </i>letters are grouped in pairs,  triplets, or even quadruplets, which are written, as a general rule, clockwise.  The IME, therefore, must take the input (usually based on a Korean alphabetical  keyboard layout) while it is being typed and it must adjust the size, spacing, and positioning of each letter as it puts them into appropriate clusters (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU178">Figure 17-8</a> on the next page). <a name="785" id="785"/><a name="IDX-245" id="IDX-245"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are learning a foreign language, you will be interested to know that there is a very useful set of programs available to you in the Kdeedu (KDE Edutainment)  package, which includes a Spanish verb trainer (KVerbos), a French alphabet  pronunciation program for kids (KLettres), and two flash card programs (KVocTrain and FlashKard). It also has some educational applications that have  nothing to do with language learning (such as a cool star atlas).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To install any of the individual Kdeedu programs, you must install the entire  kdeedu package. You can do this quite easily by using Synaptic. After starting up  Synaptic, type <span>kdeedu</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box and then follow the standard procedures  you learned in Chapter If you installed your system from a 3-CD Fedora or  Red Hat Linux 9 installation set, you can just copy the kdeedu RPM file to your  hard disk from the RPMS folder on Install Disk 3. After that, just double-click on the file to install it.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned, there are two flash card programs included in the Kdeedu  package. The more complex of these is KVocTrain, which you can run by going  to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Run Program</b> (none of the Kdeedu apps appear  in the GNOME menu). In the Run Program window, type in <span><a href="DDU0149.html#942" target="_parent">kvoctrain</a></span> and then  click <b class="calibre13">Run</b>. <a name="789" id="789"/><a name="IDX-246" id="IDX-246"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">KVocTrain is, in my opinion, needlessly complex in terms of creating your  own word lists for study; however, it is quite good when studying or appending  the various study lists available for it online. These files, which end in <b class="calibre13">kvtml</b>,  include vocabulary lists, verb conjugations, and even non-language items, such as  world capitals and musical key signatures. To get some of these lists, go to the  Kdeedu Contributed Learning Files page at <a target="_top" href="http://edu.kde.org/contrib/">http://edu.kde.org/contrib/</a> kvtml.php and download whatever you want to your hard drive. I would  recommend creating a special folder inside your Home folder in which to keep  these files. You might call the new folder <span>kdeedu_data</span>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve opened the files in KVocTrain, you can view the entries in them  in list form or as a flash card or multiple-choice quiz (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU179">Figure 17-9</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are interested in a more straightforward way of creating your own flash  cards, FlashKard is a more appropriate choice (though it can also use the same .kvtml files that KVocTrain uses). To run FlashKard, just go to the Main menu  and select <b class="calibre13">Run Program</b>, and in the Run Program window, type <span><a href="DDU0149.html#927" target="_parent">flashkard</a></span> and  then click <b class="calibre13">Run</b>. FlashKard will then appear, and you can start inputting words  that you want to study (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU180">Figure 17-10</a> on the next page). After you have  created a vocabulary list, you can quiz yourself, in typical flash card fashion,  by going to the <b class="calibre13">Function</b> menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Quiz</b>.<a name="791" id="791"/><a name="IDX-247" id="IDX-247"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the handiest programs available for language learners, or anyone else  who needs to function in a multilingual world, is the GNOME dictionary  program called StarDict (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU181">Figure 17-11</a>). It is a straightforward dictionary that  can provide definitions in a wide variety of languages all at once. </p>
<div class="calibre10">
<a name="794" id="794"/><a name="figure.DDU181" id="figure.DDU181"/><span><a href="1711_0.jpg" name="IMG_185" target="_parent" id="IMG_185"><img src="1711.jpg" alt="Click To expand" border="0" class="calibre163"/></a></span>

</div>
<a name="795" id="795"/><a name="IDX-248" id="IDX-248"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the program is up and running, it will display definitions from all the  language dictionaries that you installed when you installed StarDict. This works  in any direction, so definitions will appear for any word you type, regardless of  the language. For example, I have the Eng-Swe, Swe-Eng, Ger-Swe, Swe-Jpn, Jpn-Eng, Eng-Jpn, Chi-Eng, and Eng-Chi dictionaries all installed. If I type an  English word, I will get definitions in Swedish, Chinese, and Japanese. If I type  a Swedish word, I will get definitions in English and Japanese, and so on.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">StarDict is also a great utility for reading text in files or Web pages because  as long as the StarDict program is running, it will display definitions for words  you select with your mouse in other programs. <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU182">Figure 17-12</a> shows this inline  function in action in a Web page. This inline function is called <i class="calibre11">Scan Selection</i>,  and it also works when you are typing text into a document, or even in dialog  boxes within the system itself. If you select a word, StarDict will scan it and tell  you what it means.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get the latest version of StarDict, go to <a target="_top" href="http://stardict.sourceforge.net">http://stardict.sourceforge.net</a>  and download <b class="calibre13">stardict-2.4.2-1.i386.rpm</b> (or a newer version) to your  Tarballs_and_RPMs folder. If you happen to notice a StarDict RPM file on  your installation disks, do not use it. It is not the same.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In order to use the dictionary, you will also need to download some  dictionary files, usually a pair of dictionaries for each language pair (for  example, English-German and German-English). You can get these by clicking  on the <b class="calibre13">Dictionaries</b> link near the top of the Web page. Once you get to the Dictionaries page, you will see some additional links: <b class="calibre13">dictd-<a target="_top" href="http://www.dict.org">www.dict.org</a></b>, <b class="calibre13">dictd<a target="_top" href="http://www.freedict.de">www.freedict.de</a></b>,<b class="calibre13"> dictd-<a target="_top" href="http://www.mova.org">www.mova.org</a></b>,<b class="calibre13"> *Quick</b>,<b class="calibre13"> zh_CN</b>,<b class="calibre13"> zh_TW</b>, and<b class="calibre13"> ja</b>. The  FreeDict link (dictd-<a target="_top" href="http://www.freedict.de">www.freedict.de</a>) should have most of what you want, though  you can try them all to see what they have. When you do start downloading,  download the RPM files, not the tarballs — to keep things simple, of course.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The StarDict program and all the dictionaries for it are in the form of RPM  files (or at least they should be if you did what I told you to do), so you will  have no problems installing them. Just start off with the StarDict RPM package  and double-click it. The rest of the procedure is the same as you learned in  <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a>, so you should have no headaches. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once done with the main program, go on to the dictionaries, which you can install in the same manner. All very easy.<a name="799" id="799"/><a name="IDX-249" id="IDX-249"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Running StarDict is easy. Just go to your Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13">  More Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> StarDict</b>. StarDict will then start up and place a small applet  in the GNOME Panel. When you click this applet, it allows you to hide and show  the main dictionary window. If you right-click it, you can turn the Scan Selection  function on and off. This is very handy, because as soon as StarDict is up and  running, it will start popping up definitions any time you highlight any item of  text anywhere, which could, it seems to me, bring on the early onset of some  form of dementia.</p>
