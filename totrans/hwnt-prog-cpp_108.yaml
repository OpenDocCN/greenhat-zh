- en: When NASA attempted to launch the first space shuttle, they rolled the spacecraft
    out to the pad, put the astronauts on board, and started the countdown. Then the
    computer reported a self-check failure. They tried and tried and tried to figure
    out what was wrong. In the end, they had to cancel the launch.

- en: Programmers who have to deal with multiple processes and embedded systems have
    their own set of problems to worry about. These are usually much more difficult
    to find than ordinary errors because errors happen randomly, and bugs can resist
    discovery by testing. Furthermore, code that looks perfectly good and reasonable
    can contain hidden errors.
