    silly. Why should I, when I already own mass quantities of CDs and my own
    recorded music? I don’t even like cell phones. When I leave home, I don’t
    want an electronic leash. If I crash into the ditch, someone will find me
    eventually, and who’s to say if I could even reach a phone when I’m
    hanging upside down in a mangled vehicle? It’s really okay to be
    unconnected once in a while.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>But fortunately for you, excellent readers, this book isn’t about
    only what I like. Mobile phone owners love to have customized ringtones
    and to use their mobile devices as music players (that they can play
    loudly on their tinny lo-fi speakers in public places and annoy grumps
    like me). Most mobile service providers make it a matter of personal honor
    to charge customers for every last thing they can do with their phones,
    including ringtones and file transfers. So, you might say to yourself,
    fine, I’ll just search online for free ringtones. Be careful—most of the
    “free” sites are come-ons for pay services and sometimes malware. There
    are some legitimate online sources for free ringtones; some of them are
    mediocre amateur efforts, and some are good. In this era of the Wild Wild
    Internet, shop carefully and be on guard.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since the point of this book is doing your own audio production, how
    hard can it be to make your own ringtones and phone-friendly tunes? Not
    hard at all. Making the actual audio files is easy. The hard part is
    figuring out what audio file formats your phone supports and then how to
    transfer files into it. So let’s use Audacity to create phone-friendly
    audio files and then look at different ways of transferring files into
    your phone. You’re going to need your phone’s manual or any relevant
    technical information you can dig up. If you don’t have a manual, look on
    your phone manufacturer’s website.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Please refer to <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> if
    you need a refresher on the basics of using Audacity.</p><div class="sect1" title="Customizing Audio for a Mobile Phone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="customizing_audio_for_a_mobile_phone"/>Customizing Audio for a Mobile Phone</h1></div></div></div><p>First import the audio file into Audacity that you want to use:
      Either open an existing Audacity project or click <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span> to start a new project with a WAV, FLAC,
      MP3, Ogg, or other audio file. Save it as a new project because you’re
      going to make a lot of changes.</p><p>If it is a stereo file, first convert it to mono with <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Stereo to
      Mono</strong></span>. Unless your phone supports stereo, of course. In
      <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import/Export</strong></span>, make sure that “Always mix all
      tracks down to stereo or mono” is checked.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you need to create a ringtone of a specific length, such as 20
      to 30 seconds, select a 20- or 30-second portion of the track to use.
      Here is a slick trick for precisely measuring your selection length:
      Position the Selection tool at the beginning of your clip. Go to the
      Selection toolbar, select the “Length” radio button, make sure “Snap To”
      is not checked, and enter how many seconds long you want your clip to
      be. If you’re a bit shaky with the mouse, you can use the arrow keys on
      your keyboard to move the cursor. <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#using_the_selection_toolbar_to_create_a" title="Figure 10-1. Using the Selection toolbar to create a clip of an exact duration (in this example, 20 seconds)">Figure 10-1</a> shows how to use
      this method to create an exactly 20-second clip.</p><p>Leaving your clip selected, select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Trim</strong></span> (or press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-T) to cut away the excess. Do any other
      edits you want, such as fixing problems, boosting the volume, applying
      special effects, or whatever you desire. A good trick is to fire up
      Audacity’s equalizer to shorten the tone curve because your phone
      speaker has a limited frequency range, which you can find in its specs.
      Equalizing your audio file to match your phone speaker’s frequency range
      will make it sound fuller and less tinny. This also makes it sound
      better in earbuds and Bluetooth headsets.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For example, suppose your phone speaker has a range of 500 to
      10,000 Hz. In comparison, the full range of human hearing is about 20 to
      22,000 Hz. Reduce the frequencies outside this range by 24 dB using
      <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Equalization</strong></span>. The equalizer has two sets of
      controls; you may use either the graphical curve or the interface that
      looks like a hi-fi equalizer. Select “Graphic EQ” to display the
      equalizer (<a class="xref" href="ch10.html#the_graphic_eq_view_has_sliders_for_cont" title="Figure 10-2. The Graphic EQ view has sliders for controlling the frequencies.">Figure 10-2</a>).
      The equalizer sliders max out at a 20 dB range, while the curve has a
      range of 120 dB. A reduction of -60 dB is well beyond what we can hear
      and is as good as absolute silence.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="using_the_selection_toolbar_to_create_a"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14220"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797713.png.jpg" alt="Using the Selection toolbar to create a clip of an exact duration (in this example, 20 seconds)"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-1. Using the Selection toolbar to create a clip of an exact

      manipulated the curve by clicking the line above 500 Hz to create a
      control point, clicking at 20 Hz to create another control point, and
      then dragging the 20 Hz control point down to -24. Then I did the same
      on the other end starting at 10,000 Hz. To make changes, grab and move
      the control points, which you can move in any direction. Gradual curves
      sound better than abrupt transitions.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="here_is_the_draw_curves_view_of_the_equa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14243"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797717.png.jpg" alt="Here is the Draw curves view of the equalizer, showing a curve to match the frequency response of a telephone speaker."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-3. Here is the Draw curves view of the equalizer, showing a curve

      horizontally; making it wider exposes more of the frequency scale. The
      sliders on the left increase or decrease the size of the decibel scales.
      The equalizer has no undo function, but if you mess up incurably, you
      can hit the Flat button to reset to zero. Remove control points by
      dragging them off the graph.</p><p>You can increase amplitude by going over zero, because this is not
      the same zero as on the Zero Decibels Full Scale that we use when we’re
      recording or playing back in Audacity. It does not mark the point at
      which clipping occurs. Rather, anything over zero in the equalizer is
      simply an increase in amplitude, and anything under zero is a decrease.
      You can still cause clipping or make it too quiet, so the Preview button
      will help you with this. The Preview button will preview the first three
      seconds of your clip by default. You can change this duration in the
      <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Playback</strong></span> dialog.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You might save your customized ringtone equalization curve with
      the Save As button, and then you can apply it to all of your
      ringtones.</p><p>The “Linear frequency scale” checkbox, when you’re in Draw curves
      view, changes the scale from the default logarithmic view to linear. Use
      the logarithmic view when you want to see the lower frequencies in more
      detail.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Length of filter setting controls how many samples Audacity
      processes at a time. The default is 4,001 and should be fine most of the
      time. You can adjust this either by moving the slider with the mouse or
      by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. It is normal for Audacity to
      display a green line that follows the blue line of your equalization
      curve. This shows the curve that Audacity will actually use, which is
      affected by the limitations of the equalization algorithm. If the green
      line and blue line diverge significantly, increase the Length of Filter
      setting or smooth out your curve to make the transitions more
      gradual.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When you’re finished editing, your ringtone is ready to export,
      and you need to know what file format and specification your phone
      requires. For example, suppose your phone requires 192Kbps
      constant-bitrate MP3 at 8,000 Hz sampling rate. No problem. If your
      project sampling rate is not already 8 kHz, click <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Resample</strong></span> to resample it to the correct rate.
      The Track panel will then show the new sampling rate. Then open the
      <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>MP3

      gamut from 8-bit depth 8 kHz sampling rate to 16/44.1. If you need to
      change the sampling rate, do that before export by using the <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Resample</strong></span> dialog. Then export using the
      <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Other
      uncompressed files</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>WAV</strong></span> dialog and selecting the appropriate bit

      an 8-bit WAV looks like.</p><p>Remember, resample before export and set the bit depth at export.
      What if your phone specs specify a bitrate, such as 64Kbps? The bitrate
      is always bit depth times sampling rate times the number of channels, so
      8-bit depth times 8 kHz sampling rates times 1 channel equals a bitrate
      of 64Kbps. However, ideally your phone documentation won’t make you do
      math and will spell it all out for you.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0022" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="exporting_to_8-bit_wav"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14383"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797721.png.jpg" alt="Exporting to 8-bit WAV"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-5. Exporting to 8-bit WAV</p></div><p>Keep in mind the storage available on your phone and how much
      hi-fi is it worth trying to squeeze into a lo-fi playback device. If you
      have a choice of different quality levels, it might pay to experiment

<div class="sect1" title="Applying Dynamic Range Compression"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="applying_dynamic_range_compression"/>Applying Dynamic Range Compression</h1></div></div></div><p>Little phone speakers can’t handle much dynamic range, so you
      should compress the dynamic range of your audio files to level out
      variations in volume. I prefer <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span>
      &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Leveller</strong></span> for this because it
      reduces the gain on the louder frequencies and raises the gain on the
      quieter frequencies. The Leveller effect tends to be harsh, but it
      sounds pretty good on little mobile device speakers. <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#suggested_settings_for_effect_g_leveller" title="Figure 10-6. Suggested settings for Effect &gt; Leveller to compress the dynamic range">Figure 10-6</a>shows the settings
      I like to use: a Heavy level of compression and a low Threshold for
      Noise. The Threshold for Noise determines what frequencies it will
      change, so -80 db means virtually everything, while -20 dB affects
      frequencies at -20 dB and up.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><p>After applying the Leveller effect, you might need to normalize
      your track to raise the volume as high as possible. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Normalize</strong></span>, check “Remove any DC Offset,” check
      “Normalize maximum amplitude to,” and set the decibel value to zero,
      which is as high as you can go. <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#the_first_half_of_the_waveform_has_had_b" title="Figure 10-7. The first half of the waveform has had both the Leveller effect and Normalize effect applied. See how the highs and lows are more even than in the second part of the waveform.">Figure 10-7</a> shows a waveform
      with the first half Levelled and Normalized and the second half
      untouched.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the Leveller effect doesn’t really behave like
      a compressor but more like a limiter. A limiter is like a compressor set
      to a high ratio, like 20:1 and higher, so rather than smoothly reducing
      the gain above your threshold, it squashes it most firmly.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0032" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0033" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="suggested_settings_for_effect_g_leveller"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14467"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797723.png.jpg" alt="Suggested settings for Effect &gt; Leveller to compress the dynamic range"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-6. Suggested settings for <span class="strong">Effect</span> &gt; <span class="strong">Leveller</span> to compress the dynamic

      format not natively supported by Audacity or you prefer to use AAC, WMA,
      or some other format, you can use Audacity first to create and edit your
      audio clips, export them to WAV format, and then use a file converter
      application to convert the WAV into the correct format. Where do you
      find a converter? There are skillions of them, which you can find with a
      bit of web searching.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0042" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0043" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0046" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0051" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another option is to install the open source FFmpeg encoder. This
      is a high-quality, open source multimedia encoder, and Audacity has
      FFmpeg integration built in. FFmpeg is Free software and free of cost.
      Visit the FFmpeg documentation page (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html">http://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html</a>) to learn how to
      download and install it on Mac and Windows. Linux users can install it
      from their distribution’s software repositories.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0052" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) audio format is a lossy,
      compressed encoding and compression technology that encompasses both
      digital audio and video as part of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 specifications.
      AAC audio is supposed to sound better than MP3, which is also a lossy,
      compressed format. AAC is patented, and anyone who wants to distribute
      AAC-encoded content may do so freely without restrictions or payment.
      But a patent license is required to develop and distribute AAC
      codecs.</p><p>AAC is the default audio container format for iTunes, though
      iTunes also supports WAV, MP3, AIFF, and Apple Lossless. AAC has some
      abilities that MP3 does not, such as support for up to 48 channels,
      while MP3 supports only 2, and a wider range of sampling frequencies, 8
      kHz to 96 kHz, while MP3 supports only 16 kHz to 48 kHz. AAC is said to
      handle higher frequencies and stereo imaging better. There are some
      other differences that are more interesting to codec designers; the
      bottom line, as always, is how it sounds to you.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, one of the original developers of MP3
        and one of its many patent holders, also has a 5.1 surround-sound MP3
        encoder and decoder. As most people say when they hear about this,
        “Why bother with cruddy lo-fi six-channel surround sound? Two cruddy
        lo-fi channels are plenty.” But for those who are interested, it is
        free to evaluate on Mac or Windows only. If you like it and want to
        use it for anything other than personal evaluation, it will cost
        money.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0053" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>AAC is represented by a host of file
      extensions—<span class="emphasis"><em>.m4a</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4b</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4p</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4v</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4r</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>.3gp</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>.mp4</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>.aac</em></span>—which include
      both video and audio. Audacity uses the <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4a</em></span>
      extension, which Apple uses to indicate a non-copy-protected audio-only
      file. <span class="emphasis"><em>.m4p</em></span> is the extension used for encrypted,
      copy-protected iTunes audio files.</p><p>Saving your files in AAC format in Audacity is easy, once FFmpeg
      is installed: Click <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>M4A (AAC) Files (FFmpeg)</strong></span> &gt;
      <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>. In the Options dialog you
      have a range of quality settings from 10 to 500, with 500 being the
      highest quality. This range represents Fair, Okay, Good, Better, and
      Best. The value 256 is a good setting for a more complex recording. A
      simple recording, such as a spoken-word piece, sounds decent at 50,
      though 100 is noticeably better (<a class="xref" href="ch10s04.html#exporting_to_aac_format_open_parenth" title="Figure 10-8. Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format), which creates a file with an .m4a extension">Figure 10-8</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0054" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0056" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0064" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="exporting_to_aac_format_open_parenth"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14906"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797727.png.jpg" alt="Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format), which creates a file with an .m4a extension"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-8. Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format), which

      compression technology invented by Microsoft. WMA refers to both the
      codec and the audio file format. WMA supports a maximum 48 kHz sampling
      rate and two channels. WMA audio is usually encapsulated in an Advanced
      Systems Format (ASF) container, which contains metadata such as song
      name, artist name, and track number. ASF also supports Windows Media DRM
      (digital rights management). The file extension for DRM and non-DRM WMA
      files is the same, <span class="emphasis"><em>.wma</em></span>; if you try to play a DRM

      online services and buy all your ringtones and music from them. What if
      you just want a phone and not a web browser/email client with a tiny
      screen? Then you can order new ringtones attached to text messages. What
      if you don’t want to pay for text services or learn to type with your
      thumbs? Then you must be some kind of weirdo. Wear the label with pride,
      and let’s explore other ways to move files in and out of our phones. My
      preferred method is from a PC—my PC, that is, that I control and don’t
      have to pay fees to access.</p><p>Many phones accept SD storage cards, usually miniSD or microSD
      cards. For less than $20, you can get any of these with a USB SD card
      reader or an adapter for a standard SD card reader so you can plug it
      into a standard USB port on a computer. These cards have several
      gigabytes of storage capacity.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0068" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0069" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0070" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="encoding_your_ringtone_in_the_wma_format"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e14961"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797729.png.jpg" alt="Encoding your ringtone in the WMA format"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-9. Encoding your ringtone in the WMA format</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The first time you install a new SD card in your phone, you
        should format it using the phone’s menu. This creates the right type
        of filesystem for your phone. Your phone’s manual will tell you how.
        Formatting the storage card erases everything on it.</p></div><p>After formatting a card, just plug it into the appropriate card
      reader, plug it into your computer, copy over your new ringtones, and
      then stuff the card into your phone and transfer the files to the
      correct directory. Your phone might even have some helpful menu options
      to make this easy.</p><p>Bluetooth is another common option for connecting a mobile phone
      to a PC. It’s an odd name for a useful function: very short-range
      wireless radio networking, from 1 to 100 feet. If your computer does not
      have a Bluetooth adapter, you can buy a USB Bluetooth adapter for less
      than $30. Get Bluetooth 2.0 because that is the newest and fastest
      standard. To establish a Bluetooth networking connection, follow the
      instructions in your camera’s manual. Typically, you’ll activate
      Bluetooth on your PC, set it to <span class="emphasis"><em>discovery</em></span> mode, and
      then set up <span class="emphasis"><em>pairing</em></span> with your phone from the
      phone’s menu. If it asks you for a personal identification number (PIN),
      this is usually an arbitrary number that you invent at the time of
      discovery and then duplicate on the computer to complete the
      connection.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0071" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Some cell phone service providers disable file transfer via
      Bluetooth because they want to overcharge you for online services or
      charge you extra up front for a <span class="emphasis"><em>data connection
      kit</em></span>, which is a fancy way of saying they want to gouge you
      for uncrippling some of the phone’s built-in functions. <a class="xref" href="ch10s05.html#a_microsd_flash_storage_card_adapter_com" title="Figure 10-10. A microSD Flash storage card adapter, a wee Cirago USB Bluetooth interface, another adapter, a cute red USB microSD reader, a tiny 2GB microSD card, and a US quarter for scale">Figure 10-10</a> shows a microSD
      card, a USB Bluetooth adapter, and accessories.</p><p>Of course, you can avoid all this business of paying to unlock
      phone functions by purchasing an unlocked phone. You’ll have to figure
      out for yourself if it’s better to go with a branded phone, which is
      subsidized by the service provider and locks you in for a year or two,
      or to pay full price for the freedom of an unlocked phone.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0072" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0073" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0074" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-0075" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_microsd_flash_storage_card_adapter_com"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e15008"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797731.png.jpg" alt="A microSD Flash storage card adapter, a wee Cirago USB Bluetooth interface, another adapter, a cute red USB microSD reader, a tiny 2GB microSD card, and a US quarter for scale"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-10. A microSD Flash storage card adapter, a wee Cirago USB

      computer and a cell phone is via an ordinary USB cable, and some phones
      support this.</p><p>Any of these methods can be used for any kind of file transfer,
      and not just your ringtones. Photos, contacts, messages, any of the data
      stored in your phone can be backed up to a PC or transferred from a PC
      to your phone. There are many Windows and Apple software applications
      for managing your mobile phone from your computer. These usually cost a
      few dollars. There is a good open source, free-of-cost application worth
      trying that runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows: BitPim. To quote the BitPim
      website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bitpim.org/">http://www.bitpim.org/</a>):<a id="IDX-CHP-10-0076" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>BitPim is a program that allows you to view and manipulate data
