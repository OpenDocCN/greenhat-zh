Far from being geometrically perfect (and boring) like other vector tools, the Calligraphic pen has character—and it produces always-editable vector objects.</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ll go through the process of creating a simple drawing entirely in Inkscape—let’s try drawing a funny, cartoon running horse which might be a mascot or a comic character. I’ve always found it challenging to draw anything from scratch (and I imagine many readers can sympathize). Yet with Inkscape, I was able to make a drawing that I actually liked.</p></div>

If you have a graphics tablet, enable the pen pressure for varying the stroke width (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot1dot1_pressure_sensitivity" title="14.3.1.1 Pressure Sensitivity">14.3.1.1 Pressure Sensitivity</a></strong></span>). The <span class="strong"><strong>Angle</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Fixation</strong></span> parameters only make sense for calligraphy, not freehand drawing, so we’ll set the <span class="strong"><strong>Fixation</strong></span> to 0, which effectively turns a fixed-angle pen into a round brush that has no orientation (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot2_angle" title="14.3.2 Angle">14.3.2 Angle</a></strong></span>).</p><p><a id="iddle2304" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2557" class="indexterm"/>I’ve never drawn a horse before, and my first several strokes make this brutally obvious. With a beginning like this, I think many would be tempted, as I was, to give up right then and there. But patience and hard work pay off, especially in Inkscape. Just keep throwing strokes onto the canvas, undoing, tweaking, and throwing again. Sooner or later, something which is not entirely dreadful will flash through the tangle of bad lines.</p><div class="figure"><a id="first_strokes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00390"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736442.png.jpg" alt="The first strokes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-1. The first strokes</p></div><p>For most people, drawing objects requires visual aids; you may find it hard to visualize on your own how a horse’s body curves or which way the legs bend. I found that photos of real horses were of little help to me. Much more inspirational were stylized <span class="emphasis"><em>drawings</em></span> of horses, where other, more capable artists have already done the hard work of abstracting and amplifying the core equestrian visual features. A Google image search will provide you with plenty of reference material. After much sketching, undoing, and emphasizing (by adding pen pressure), I arrived at this sketch:</p><div class="figure"><a id="first_sketch"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00391"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736444.png.jpg" alt="The first sketch"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-2. The first sketch</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="22.2 Inking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two2dot2_inking"/>22.2 Inking</h1></div></div></div><p>The workflow of a comic or cartoon artist includes two main stages: <span class="emphasis"><em>sketching</em></span> (typically with a pencil) and <span class="emphasis"><em>inking</em></span> (with a pen) over the rough sketch. You can follow the same process in Inkscape. Now that the drawing looks more or less <a id="iddle1746" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3398" class="indexterm"/>like a horse, it is time to start inking <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> it to develop it further. This way, you can see what was good in the original sketch and try to build on that without the risk of destroying it with too much tweaking. Select all strokes (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00823"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735370.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and assign them an opacity of 0.05 so they become barely visible; this effectively hides the thin strokes, making it easier to concentrate on the bold ones. Then, lock this layer (using the lock toggle button in the status bar), create a new one (<span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Add Layer</strong></span>), and draw the same horse <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span>, using the sketch as the guide:</p><div class="figure"><a id="inking_the_sketch_in_a_new_layer"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00392"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736446.png.jpg" alt="Inking the sketch in a new layer"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-3. Inking the sketch in a new layer</p></div><p>Is this the same horse? Not quite. The horse in the first sketch tried to look like a real horse—perhaps too real. Remember that what we want is a cartoon, not something realistic. This is typically achieved by enlarging, out of proportion, the head (especially the eyes) and the legs (or hands, or paws) of your creature. In the first inking layer, let’s do just that: Keep the body the same but enlarge the hooves and the head, adding a pair of oversized, cartoonish eyes:</p><div class="figure"><a id="getting_cartoonish"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00393"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736448.png.jpg" alt="Getting cartoonish"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-4. Getting cartoonish</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="22.3 Tweaking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two2dot3_tweaking"/>22.3 Tweaking</h1></div></div></div><p>The unique advantage of a vector editor is that all strokes remain independent objects. This makes it easy to nudge, scale, or rotate parts of your drawing. With the Selector tool, drag around the leg or the head to select all its objects and use either the mouse handles or the convenient keyboard shortcuts: <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00824"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-arrows <a id="iddle1328" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2756" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3217" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4789" class="indexterm"/>to move, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00825"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736208.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00826"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736206.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to scale, or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00827"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736200.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00828"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736202.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to rotate. It is fairly easy to produce a good stroke at a wrong scale or in the wrong location and then transform it to fit. Even if it already looks acceptable, playing with the limbs or facial features of your character can make it more expressive than you thought possible:</p><div class="figure"><a id="adjusting_elements_of_a_drawing"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00394"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736450.png.jpg" alt="Adjusting elements of a drawing"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-5. Adjusting elements of a drawing</p></div><p>Unlike on paper, you are not limited to just one inking layer. At any time, you can hide the previous sketch layer, fade out, lock your current layer to make it a new sketch, and create a new inking layer on top. Usually, with every such transition your drawing will look less and less like a pencil sketch and more like a real ink drawing with smoother strokes and more elaborate details. Here is my third inking attempt over the previous sketch layers (the head was especially difficult to sculpt—my horse originally looked more like a hippopotamus):</p><div class="figure"><a id="another_inking_layer"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00395"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736452.png.jpg" alt="Another inking layer"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-6. Another inking layer</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="22.4 Coloring and Smoothing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two2dot4_coloring_and_smoothing"/>22.4 Coloring and Smoothing</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that the outline is almost done, it’s time to start thinking about coloring the drawing. Inkscape can emulate many different styles of coloring. For example, you can imitate a painting by overlying many random calligraphic strokes and painting each one with a different color and opacity (you can use the Tweak tool for that, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html#eightdot7dot1_color_paint" title="8.7.1 Color Paint">8.7.1 Color Paint</a></strong></span>). Let’s try a more traditional, smooth coloring, consisting of a flat color fill with some lighting and shading (white and black ellipses with elliptic opacity gradients, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10s01.html#one0dot1dot2_elliptic_gradients" title="10.1.2 Elliptic Gradients">10.1.2 Elliptic Gradients</a></strong></span>). Use the Paint bucket tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s04.html" title="14.4 The Paint Bucket Tool">14.4 The Paint Bucket Tool</a></strong></span>) to create the interior shape; you can apply a little blur to it (about 2 percent) for extra smoothness (<a class="xref" href="ch22s04.html#coloring_options" title="Figure 22-7. Coloring options">Figure 22-7</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="coloring_options"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00396"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736454.png.jpg" alt="Coloring options"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-7. Coloring options</p></div><p><a id="iddle1183" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1419" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3305" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3361" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3385" class="indexterm"/>Let’s get back to our outline (hide the coloring layer for now). It can be made much smoother and more attractive if you select all the strokes of some part of the figure (such as a leg or the head), union them (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00829"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735892.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), and simplify the result by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00830"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> a few times. This melts the sharp corners and welds the joints for a much more natural and integral look. Another very useful trick is making all strokes thicker by outsetting them (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00831"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736456.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) or thinner by insetting (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00832"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735928.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s04.html" title="12.4 Offsetting">12.4 Offsetting</a></strong></span>). Multiple insets and outsets on a path have an effect similar to simplification. Too much insetting may make some parts of a stroke disappear altogether, but this is not necessarily bad—trust the overall impression and your artistic sense. Of course, the Node tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html" title="12.5 The Node Tool">12.5 The Node Tool</a></strong></span>) can also be used for manual editing of strokes.</p><div class="figure"><a id="welding_and_melting"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00397"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736458.png.jpg" alt="Welding and melting"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-8. Welding and melting</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="22.5 Drawing Hair"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two2dot5_drawing_hair"/>22.5 Drawing Hair</h1></div></div></div><p>For many beginning artists, drawing realistic-looking hair is especially difficult. Striking the right balance between regularity and chaos, between tidiness and untidiness is critical for the impression that your character will make. At this stage, the tail and especially the mane of my horse weren’t impressive—I drew them over and over many times, but all my attempts looked either too lumpy or too bushy (or both). I was finally able to produce a decent wavy hair by using a high value of <span class="strong"><strong>Tremor</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot4_tremorcomma_wigglecomma_and" title="14.3.4 Tremor, Wiggle, and Mass">14.3.4 Tremor, Wiggle, and Mass</a></strong></span>) in the Calligraphic pen, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch22s05.html#drawing_hair" title="Figure 22-9. Drawing hair">Figure 22-9</a>. Maximizing this parameter makes the calligraphic brush strokes nicely blotchy and much more uniformly uneven than I was able to make them manually.</p><div class="figure"><a id="drawing_hair"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00398"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736460.png.jpg" alt="Drawing hair"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-9. Drawing hair</p></div></div>

Overall, the result turned out much better than I expected, and I’m pretty sure I would never be able to achieve this level of quality by drawing on paper. Of course, this is not the only style of drawing that you can do in Inkscape; experiment to find the techniques that are most natural for you. I have grown to especially like the Calligraphic pen with a high <span class="strong"><strong>Tremor</strong></span> value, which gives you an almost “natural media” drawing tool.</p><div class="figure"><a id="other_freehand_drawing_examples"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00399"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736462.png.jpg" alt="Other freehand drawing examples"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-10. Other freehand drawing examples</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch22note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>While the best device for drawing on the computer is a graphics tablet (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot1dot1_pressure_sensitivity" title="14.3.1.1 Pressure Sensitivity">14.3.1.1 Pressure Sensitivity</a></strong></span>), it</em></span> is <span class="emphasis"><em>possible to do decent Inkscape drawings with a mouse only.
