    it is up and running, and you are ready and rarin’ to go. If you are running Ubuntu
    from your hard disk, the first thing you may see, depending on how you set things
    up, is the login screen that will appear each and every time you boot up ([Figure 3-1](ch03.html#the_ubuntu_login_screen-id1
    "Figure 3-1. The Ubuntu login screen")). If so, type in your password and press
    enter, and you’ll be face to face with the Ubuntu desktop. If you set up your
    system during installation to bypass the login phase, or if you are still running
    Ubuntu from the live disc, you’re already there. Either way, let’s get down to
    getting to know your new home.

    "Figure 3-2. The Unity desktop in Ubuntu")) is a pretty familiar looking place.
    In fact, it looks a lot like what you might be used to in Windows, Mac OS, or
    even another Linux distribution. Look a bit closer, however, and you start to
    notice that things are not quite the same. There is no task bar or Start button
    at the bottom of the screen, there are no desktop icons, there seems to be only
    one menu in the top panel, and there is something that looks like the Mac OS X
    Dock on the left side of the screen. Yup, things are a bit different.

    its 11.04 release. Unity is designed to be usable on any number of devices, not
    just on PCs, meaning that someday you could conceivably be using the exact same
    operating system on your PC, your phone, your tablet computer, and who knows what
    else. Although Unity is a bit different from what you might be used to in terms
    of operation, it isn’t completely alien, and working in Unity quickly becomes
    second nature. To get you started, I’ll try to familiarize you with the elements
    of the desktop and how they all work.

    the title bar of that window, as you can see in [Figure 3-6](ch03.html#the_top_panel_becomes_the_menu_and_title
    "Figure 3-6. The top panel becomes the menu and title bar of a maximized window.").
    (The *title bar* is the bar that runs across the top of a window, where the title
    of the window and its controls are located.) This shouldn’t be a problem, of course,
    but it is something to bear in mind so you don’t panic when you can’t find the
    top of your window under the top panel. It’s not under the panel—it *is* the panel!
    Fortunately this seemingly mysterious metamorphosis is easily altered. To get
    your window back to its earlier, normal size, just double-click the top panel
    or click the maximize button again on the left end of the panel.'

    on the ball, so to speak. To that end, the HUD allows you to do many normally
    mouse-driven tasks by keyboard. Whatever application is in focus—whether it be
    the desktop, the file manager, Firefox, or the Terminal—pressing the alt key will
    bring up a command box for that application at the top left of the screen. ([Figure 3-16](ch03.html#bookmarking_a_page_in_firefox_via_the_hu

    you want to go, or what you are looking for by typing commands or keywords and
    then pressing enter. Basically, if it can be done in the application’s menus,
    it can also be done in the HUD.

    by keyboard. You can save a file, for example, by typing **`save`**, navigate
    from one folder to another in the file manager by typing the name of the folder
    you want to move to, or print a document by typing **`print`**. You can even play
    a song in Rhythmbox by typing the song’s name. The more you play around with HUD
    and try to use it, the easier and thus more useful it will become.

    you’ve just typed. Pretty handy, I must say.

    it, there will likely be times when you have a few apps and a lot of windows open
    at the same time. When it’s only a couple of windows you want to arrange more
    neatly, you can just drag one window to either side of the screen, and it will
    then automatically resize itself to fit into that area. You can do the same for
    the other window, making it easy to work with both items side by side.

    windows all at once, it can get confusing to figure out what’s running or even
    where a certain window is, buried among what seems like a hundred others. In this
    case, the Launcher can come in handy—it’s not only useful for starting up frequently
    used apps but also great for switching between applications or windows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help with this, the Launcher has a system of indicators that let you know
    what you’ve got open and running. When any Launcher item is running and its window
    is the one currently with *focus* (meaning it is the application window currently
    in active use), a small arrow will appear to the right of the Launcher icon for
    that item (as you see for the home launcher in [Figure 3-17](ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru
    "Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple
    windows open.")). When the window for an open or running Launcher item is not
    focused, an arrow will appear to the left of its Launcher icon (as you see for
    the LibreOffice Writer icon in [Figure 3-17](ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru
    "Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple
    windows open.")). If more than one application window is open, with focus or not,
    white dash marks will appear to the left of the shortcut button instead of an
    arrow—two marks if two windows are open and three if three or more windows are
    open (also shown in [Figure 3-17](ch03.html#the_launcher_shows_you_which_apps_are_ru
    "Figure 3-17. The Launcher shows you which apps are running and which have multiple
    windows open.")). Of course, if a Launcher item is not running or open, no marks
    will appear on either side of that Launcher icon.

    the icons for the application you want to switch to. You can also do this from
    your keyboard by repeatedly pressing alt-tab until you get to the application
    you want to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    running) is to hold down the Windows key. After a second or so, the icons on the
    Launcher will become numbered, as you can see in [Figure 3-18](ch03.html#switching_between_applications_and_windo
    "Figure 3-18. Switching between applications and windows on the Launcher by numbers").
    You can then switch to the application you want by pressing the number on your
    keyboard that corresponds to it. If more than one window of that application is
    open, the most recently used window will gain focus.

    in the right place—the window with focus may not be the one you want to deal with
    at that moment. For example, let’s say you have six file manager windows open
    and they’re all piled on top of one another. The one with focus is Documents,
    but you are looking for the one with your photos of your trip to Cyprus last summer.
    You could wade around with your mouse, dragging windows out of the way until you
    find the one you’re looking for.
  prefs: []

- en: A slightly easier way of going about this is to click any one of the open windows
    to give it focus, and then repeatedly press alt and the key immediately above
    tab (on most US keyboards, this is the key with the *accent grave* and tilde symbols
    it) until you reach the window you want. Alternatively, you can find the window
    in a more direct manner by clicking the Launcher icon for your application (in
    this case the home button) once more, after which all the open windows related
    to the application for that Launcher icon will appear at once ([Figure 3-19](ch03.html#seeing_all_the_open_windows_for_a_single
    "Figure 3-19. Seeing all the open windows for a single application via the Launcher")).
    You then just click the window you want to go to.

    for a particular application, at the same time. To do this, press the Windows
    and W keys. If you want to hide all of the windows so you can see the desktop
    itself, press ctrl-alt-D.

    time to discuss *virtual desktops*. Although the virtual desktop feature has only
    recently made its way into other operating systems, it has been a Linux feature
    for years (yes, it started here, folks). An easy way to think of virtual desktops
    is to think of your desktop as the top left quadrant of a four-times-bigger desktop.
    Most of the time you are using only that one piece of your total working space.
    But if you click the Workspace Switcher button on the Launcher ([Figure 3-20](ch03.html#the_workplace_switcher_button_in_the_lau
    "Figure 3-20. The Workplace Switcher button in the Launcher")), you can see the
    rest of your desktop kingdom.

    than it seems, you have to see it in action to get a good feel for it. If you
    click the Workspace Switcher button again, you will be back to your original,
    familiar piece of desktop. Now open a few windows. For example, click the buttons
    for the Home folder, LibreOffice Writer, LibreOffice Calc, and System Settings
    (or whatever apps you prefer). Once you have an open window for each of them,
    start by dragging the System Settings window toward the bottom of the desktop
    until you can only see about half of it. Drag the LibreOffice Calc window to the
    right of the screen until you see only half of it and then drag the LibreOffice
    Writer window to the bottom-right corner of the screen until you can see only
    about one-quarter of it. When you click the Desktop Switcher button this time,
    your screen should look something like [Figure 3-21](ch03.html#viewing_your_virtual_desktops

    you can move the windows to any quarter of that considerable area. Give it a try
    now. Drag those windows around until you have one window in each quarter of your
    desktop. Now, if you want to work with one of those windows, just double-click
    that portion of the screen. Your screen will now show only that portion of the
    desktop.

    Switcher button and then double-click the quadrant where the window is located.
    It is all really easy once you get the hang of it. It’s very handy too. You can
    separate your desktop into work areas, for example, with one part for writing
    a letter, another for all the budget items you are dealing with, and another for
    games when you need a little break.

    this chapter, it most likely means that Ubuntu automatically started you up in
    what is called *fallback mode*. Fallback mode is an environment that is simpler
    in appearance and less demanding of video hardware. It is also referred to as
    *2D mode*. In case you’re wondering which mode you are in, the clearest giveaway
    is the Dash button. If the Dash button is a dark charcoal-gray with a white Ubuntu
    logo, then you are in 2D fallback mode. If it is a pleasant plum color with a
    white logo, then you are in the standard 3D mode.
  prefs: []

- en: Ubuntu defaults to fallback mode when your hardware, particularly your video
    card, does not have what Ubuntu needs in order to run Unity, which is fairly demanding
    of graphics hardware. Possibly your card is too old or too new or just too underpowered,
    or the drivers your system needs to use the card to its full potential may not
    be installed. You can check if drivers are available for your machine by clicking
    the **System Settings** button in the Launcher. When the System Settings window
    appears, click **Additional Drivers**. The Additional Drivers window ([Figure 3-22](ch03.html#installing_video_drivers
    "Figure 3-22. Installing video drivers")) will appear and let you know if there
    are any drivers available for you to install. If there are, then make any selection
    you are recommended to make and click **Activate**.

    it’s easy to see a list of the Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Just press and hold

    ([Figure 3-23](ch03.html#viewing_a_list_of_ubuntu_keyboard_shortc "Figure 3-23. Viewing
