- en: Real Computer Scientists admire ADA for its overwhelming aesthetic value, but
    they find it difficult to actually program in it, as it is much too large to implement.
    Most computer scientists don't notice this because they are still arguing over
    what else to add to ADA.

- en: Real Computer Scientists despise the idea of actual hardware. Hardware has limitations;
    software doesn't. It's a real shame that Turing machines are so poor at I/O.

- en: Real Computer Scientists don't write code. They occasionally tinker with "programming
    systems," but those are so high level that they hardly count (and rarely count
    accurately; precision is for applications).

    hardware. Nobody trusts them to write specs for anything homo sapiens will ever
    be able to fit on a single planet.
