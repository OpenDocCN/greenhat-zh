    PHP. Many use phpMyAdmin as a substitute for the command-line tools included with
    the default installation of MySQL. phpMyAdmin is the recipient of numerous industry
    awards, and it has garnered much praise from the database administrator community.

- en: Development of phpMyAdmin began in 1998 by IT consultant Tobias Ratschiller.
    Ratschiller's work was based loosely on a program called MySQL-Webadmin, a product
    of Peter Kuppelwieser's, who had ceased development at the time. Ratschiller wrote
    new code for phpMyAdmin, and improved on concepts from Kuppelwieser's project.
    Ratschiller left the phpMyAdmin project in 2001\. A team of eight developers led
    by Olivier Müller continues development of phpMyAdmin at SourceForge.net ([http://sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net)).
