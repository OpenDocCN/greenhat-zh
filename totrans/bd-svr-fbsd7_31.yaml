- en: Lynx began as a project of the University of Kansas in 1989\. The university
    wanted to create a campus-wide information system. Lynx was developed as an interface
    to this information-sharing project. Connections to the campus network were made
    using Unix-based consoles that did not support graphical interfaces. Early versions
    of Lynx supported a proprietary hypertext format; this feature was subsequently
    dropped after support for HTML was added.

    Lynx at the University of Kansas. They have since moved on to other pursuits.
    Lynx was adopted by an international team of volunteers in 1994; they continue
    Lynx development today.
