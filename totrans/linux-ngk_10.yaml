- en: You’ve learned how to install RPM packages via the Package Manager and directly
    via the double-click method. However, believe it or not, there is yet a third
    way, called APT (Advanced Package Tool), to install new RPM-based software. In
    fact, anyone familiar with the Linux Debian distro or with the Fink program on
    Mac OS X will probably already be familiar with the APT program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Debian version of APT is designed to download special Debian APT packages
    from which it installs a program and all its dependencies. These APT packages,
    however, do not work on Fedora because they are not RPMs. There is, however, a
    special variation on the original Debian version of APT that is designed to work
    on RPM-based systems, such as Fedora Core. APT connects to an RPM repository on
    the Internet and then downloads all the programs you select, as well as the dependencies
    for those programs. The programs are downloaded as RPM files, which APT then installs
    on your system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APT is a very easy, safe, and foolproof way of installing programs, because
    nothing will go missing, and it makes dependency hell pretty much a thing of the
    past. Of course, not every program or file is available in an APT repository,
    so the other methods you have learned so far are not for naught. There are also
    still other applications that are not available as RPMs at all, but you will learn
    how to deal with those in the [next chapter](DDU0084_split_000.html#488). Nevertheless,
    there are plenty of files that you can download and install, or (very importantly)
    just update, via APT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The one thing about APT that some people might consider a problem is that it
    is a command-driven application. This means that you have to run it via commands
    in the Linux Command Terminal. Fortunately, you can avoid this more cumbersome
    way of doing things by installing the program Synaptic, which is a graphical front
    end for APT. Synaptic allows you to use APT graphically, and thus quite easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there are a variety of APT repositories on the Internet, and the version
    of APT offered at these various repositories is usually preconfigured to download
    RPMs from that particular repository. In addition, the packages from one repository
    are not guaranteed to be compatible with those from another, meaning that conflicts
    could occur if you mix files from different repositories (though I must admit
    to having never had problems myself in this regard). To stay on the safe side
    and keep things convenient, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing, we will
    be using the repositories at Freshrpms for APT, and for RPMs not available from
    Freshrpms, we will use, whenever possible, the Freshrpms- compatible DAG repository,
    from which you will download several RPMs while performing some of the projects
    in this book.

    becoming root.

    it and look for an entry beginning with the word **Acquire**. When you find it,
    change it so that it looks similar to the entry in the following example, but
    use the proxy and port information supplied by your service provider or network

    If you are such a person, and you choose not to download MPlayer (or you choose
    to download gxine instead), you should download the MP3 encoder LAME, which is
    normally downloaded as one of the dependencies for MPlayer. LAME is used to convert
    WAV sound files (like those on an audio CD) into the popular space-saving MP3
    sound files. You will need LAME installed on your machine by the time you reach
