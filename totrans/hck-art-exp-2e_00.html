Understanding hacking techniques is often difficult, since it requires both breadth and depth of knowledge. Many hacking texts seem esoteric and confusing because of just a few gaps in this prerequisite education. This second edition of <span class="emphasis"><em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em></span> makes the world of hacking more accessible by providing the complete picture—from programming to machine code to exploitation. In addition, this edition features a bootable LiveCD based on Ubuntu Linux that can be used in any computer with an <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>86 processor, without modifying the computer's existing OS. This CD contains all the source code in the book and provides a development and exploitation environment you can use to follow along with the book's examples and experiment along the way.</p></div></body></html>
