    work in progress—are usually not suitable article topics if they are just speculative.
    Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. If you have good verifiable sources and a precise
    future event, then you can write about it in Wikipedia. Material related, for
    example, to a new road being built can be in articles, but only when appropriately
    tagged. Blue-bar informative templates exist for this purpose (in [[Category:Temporal
    templates]]). If a topic is time sensitive, you should flag the information correctly.
    For example, as of 2008, no confirmed sightings of a [[Yeti]] have been made.
    The quick way to indicate that information is valid as of a particular date is
    to use the `{{As of|`*`year}}`* template, replacing year with the valid *`year`*.

    will fend off almost all intruders, reduce edit conflicts, show you know what

    G. Wells, was an English writer best known for such science fiction novels as
    *The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man*, and *The Island
    of Doctor Moreau*. He was a prolific writer of both fiction and non-fiction, and
    produced works in many different genres, including contemporary novels, history,
    and social commentary. He was also an outspoken socialist. His later works become
    increasingly political and didactic, and only his early science fiction novels
    are widely read today. Wells, along with Hugo Gernsback and Jules Verne, is sometimes
    referred to as "The Father of Science Fiction."

    the title "father of" anything? But these might also be covered better later in

    have at most three paragraphs, so it could be a little more complicated than the
    example. But if an article has three main ideas, A, B, and C, you should introduce
    only one idea per paragraph. The topic structure could be something like A-BA-BC,

    break it to you, others may delete parts of the article they don't find credible,
    and in some cases, the whole article may be deleted. A good article is well documented,
    with reputable sources cited for all facts. As an article author, you're responsible
    for referencing your work; at the very least when writing, include a selection
    of the sources you used to put the article together. If you can't find a source
    for a fact, it probably doesn't belong in the encyclopedia.

- en: The research for any substantial article should take at least as long—and probably
    much longer—than the actual writing. This requirement to research puts limits
    on how prolific anyone can be as a Wikipedia author; after all, Wikipedia is not
    a touch-typing test. Thus, although wiki editing is quick and spontaneous, writing
    a good article depends on a great deal of preparation time spent gathering sources
    and searching for information, and the skilled Wikipedia editor must also be skilled
    at these research tasks. Although adding things you know "off the top of your
    head" is easy and tempting, think about how you actually know that fact. Is it
    something you learned in school or spent time researching? Have you seen it yourself,
    or is it something you heard? If you can remember how you learned it, you can
    probably cite a source. You'll still need to research even if you mainly modify
    existing articles, rather than beginning new ones. Edits and additions to articles
    are more easily accepted by other editors if they are accompanied by good supporting
    citations. And if you enjoy doing research, fact-checking existing articles and
    adding existing citations is also a major cleanup task, as described in [Chapter 7](hw-wkpd-wk_09.html
    "Chapter 7. Cleanup, Projects, and Processes"). Finally, good research skills
    are useful for evaluating information in an article; if you question a particular
    point on a talk page, for instance, first do a quick search to see if the information
    is supported elsewhere or not.

    by Thomas Mann is one such guide), libraries and librarians (whose job is to help
    with research questions), and forums such as Wikipedia's own reference desk (at
    [[Wikipedia:Reference desk]]), where you can ask questions about any topic. Ideally

    also thoughtful preparation ahead of exposing your work to criticism and modification
    in an open forum. Good research can give you confidence in the content you're

    editors about content—which may be important, because Wikipedia, like online communities
    in general, can be an argumentative place.

- en: The Verifiability and No Original Research policies are the background to referencing
    information on Wikipedia. All facts should be verifiable, and theories that are
    advanced must be based only on what is already published, without novel synthesis.
    In practice, this means that sources should be cited for facts in accordance with
    the Reliable Sources guideline. From Wikipedia's point of view, some sources are
    better than others. What is also true is that, whereas all facts should flow from
    reliable sources, some facts are more worthy of thorough research before including
    them in an article than others. Anything contentious, or possibly suspect, should
    be well documented first. In contentious areas, however, don't expect complete
    agreement on what a reliable source is. If an article presents two sides of an
    issue, its editors should find reputable authorities on both sides.

    to it in the article. A variety of referencing styles have been adopted and ultimately
    rejected over the years on Wikipedia—not to mention the half-dozen styles commonly
    used in academia being added to the mix and technological solutions such as templates
    being introduced. What all these referencing styles have in common, however, is
    they attempt to make it clear where information in an article comes from and what
    sources were used. Getting the specific style of the reference right is much less
    important than making sure the reference is present in the first place; other
    editors can always come along and edit it stylistically.

- en: That said, we recommend the *inline* referencing style, where specific references
    are noted in the main body of the text using numbered superscript links to footnotes.
    These footnotes appear at the end of the article (usually grouped in a section
    called References or Notes) and contain the specific references used for each
    piece of information that has a footnote. This style is gradually becoming the
    most common on Wikipedia today, and it has several advantages. In-text links to
    footnotes means a reader can easily click to the source for any particular piece
    of information and that you can make very specific citations—each sentence in
    an article could conceivably have a footnote to a different specific source. The
    citations for each fact can appear directly next to that fact. This style also
    means that an article can easily acquire more sources over time; if an editor
    finds a perfect source for documenting a single fact in an article, he or she
    can easily insert a footnote to that source, and the list of footnotes and their
    numbers will automatically update. Additionally, if a footnote is deleted through
    text being edited or moved, the footnote numbers will automatically update. This
    makes it a good style for collaborative referencing work.

    in an article (including common knowledge) needs to be cited to a source or just
    the key points. Questions have also been raised over whether having a large number
    of footnotes in an article detracts from its readability and even its usefulness
    to the reader, who does not have to query every fact to learn the material. These
    arguments aside, having a specific source immediately accessible is useful, and
    footnotes make this possible.

    or include asides to the main text, though these are less common in articles.
    For a comprehensively referenced article, the footnote section (which in this
    case would be called Notes) can also be combined with a separate References or
    Further reading section, where works can be listed as general references for the
    whole article. [Figure 6-3](#the_references_further_reading_and_exter "Figure 6-3. The

    limitation of the current footnoting system is that if you want to change any

    doesn't work; you have to type out the entire reference again. If this becomes

    If you create an article with wikilinks, are you going to be satisfied with all
    the pages you find when you click the bluelinks? The site has many articles that
    need to be improved, so you'll likely also fix up and expand deficient articles
    to support your own articles; you will also most likely come to work edit-by-edit
    in a piecemeal way. And as an editor you'll find yourself one of a crowd. In the
    collaborative environment of Wikipedia, taking into account the input of others
    is critical. One of the first questions that newcomers often ask is "What happens
    when two people disagree?" The answer is the editors involved try to work toward
    *consensus*, which is one of the cornerstones of how Wikipedia works. In [Chapter 14](hw-wkpd-wk_17.html
    "Chapter 14. Disputes, Blocks, and Bans"), we'll cover the general idea of getting

    to be done on an article, many editing tasks will suggest themselves; if this
    is the case, you need a plan of action. For instance, restructuring the logical
    flow of an article is more fundamental than rewording and should take priority.
    Usually, you determine to change certain things about an article but probably
    not everything, nor all at once. This is the best way. Making changes in discrete
    logical steps, using good edit summaries (and sometimes a note on the talk page)
    can help others figure out, and accept, what you're doing to the article. Set
    yourself limited and reasonable goals, for instance, choosing a single section
    to improve content and wording.

    effectively pasting a new article on top, and the diff may show just a few words

    aim to keep anything of value that was already in the article, and the best approach
    is for the article to demonstrate a steady improvement, stepwise and sectionwise.
    Otherwise, you risk coming under suspicion that you are adopting a high-handed
    approach. If you hate some format or other minor convention being used, add a
    note to the talk page before going in and switching it all around. Making wholesale
    formatting changes across many articles without asking for input from others is
    likely to cause controversy.

    you write will be changed by others, and at some point someone will redo or undo
    a major change that you have made. While this is a natural part of working on
    Wikipedia, adding material that is routinely taken out at some later point ultimately
    becomes fooling around. Will this wholesale rejection happen to you? If you spend

    to the same content and style policies as articles overall, but individual edits
    are discussed in a different way. Articles that have some deficiencies are given
    the benefit of the doubt and are in time worked on and cleaned up. Only articles
    that demonstrate a scanty grasp of basic policies should be dealt with harshly.
    Individual edits, though, may just be reverted as substandard. Try to understand
    why the edit was undone. Are you simply wrong about a point or inserting opinion

    controversy, and don''t be a stormy petrel, bringing trouble with you. Some topics
    are certainly more contentious than others; as a new editor, you may want to start
    working on articles dealing with less controversial topics (starting with articles
    about politics or historical disputes is never a good idea). Third, be broadminded.
    Appreciate where other editors are coming from. They may be at least as reasonable
    and well informed as you, and they probably have a different perspective on the
    matter. Recognize that others might have a good reason for disagreeing with you:

    including *can edit*, meaning that *anyone* is welcome to edit any page. Don''t
    growl, be territorial, or kick up a fuss over this; obstinacy ("You cannot be
    serious about cutting my work") is not the wiki way.'

    are not only released under an open license, but also they are released into the
    open and collaborative editing environment, where anyone is both free and encouraged
    to work on the page. If you disagree with someone''s changes to an article you
    started, work to resolve this dispute on the talk page and come to consensus as
    you would on any other page. See [[Wikipedia:Ownership of articles]] (shortcut
    WP:OWN) for a fundamental policy on editorial behavior. And remember the positive
    benefits of working with others: They will bring a different perspective to the
    article, may fix mistakes that you never saw, and will add content to the page.'

- en: Much of what is needed to become a good contributor to Wikipedia derives from
    skills that are more generally useful, such as researching and organizing material,
    writing clearly and logically for a broad audience, and supporting claims with
    detailed references. Any logged-in user with a registered account can start a
    new article easily; the best way to begin an article is to start with a redlink
    on another page. Wikipedia has several style conventions for article titles and
    how they should be put together. The *Manual of Style*, a collection of style
    guidelines, provides guidance on how best to style an article. Both good writing
    and good research skills are critical to producing an excellent article.

    of others as he or she edits. Editing is collective, so an editor should comprehend
    and use the spaces and forums to interact and should treat other editors as colleagues.
