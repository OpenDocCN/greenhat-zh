    suffers from its fair share of annoyances, and although I seem to spend far less
    time fixing things on Ubuntu than I ever used to on Windows, it’s best not to
    ignore the possibility that you might someday experience a hardware hiccup or
    sticky software situation.

    and troubleshooting hints. You’ll find step-by-step instructions on how to fix
    several specific problems, but for the most part I’ve tried to keep the discussion
    general. This is because the way you resolve some issues will depend heavily on
    the peculiarities of your setup, and there just isn’t a bookshelf big enough for
    a guide that covers every possible eventuality in suitable detail. Fortunately,
    the Internet harbors a sizable collection of Ubuntu-related guides, so even if
    you don’t arrive at the exact answer you were looking for here, I hope you’ll
    be able to use some of my tips to help you find the right information on the Web.

    from. It’s possible to check whether a disc has faults on it by doing a checksum
    test. A checksum is sort of like a fingerprint; you take the checksum of your
    Ubuntu CD and compare it with the checksum of an Ubuntu CD that is known to be
    free of faults. If there is but one tiny difference between the two discs, the
    checksums will be different too—the “fingerprints” won’t match. Ubuntu uses the
    MD5SUM program to do its checksums. Go to [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/)
    and scroll down to the “MD5SUM on Windows” section to see how you can find the
    checksum of your disc. If it turns out that the checksums don’t match, you’ll
    need to get another CD (for example, by downloading a CD image from [http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)

    serious in that they make it difficult to run software on the computer—the physical
    hardware side of your computer won’t be damaged at all, so once you get the software

    that you don’t have the necessary *codec* installed to play the file. A codec
    is a small piece of software that adds support for a given audio/video format
    into a program. Rhythmbox and the Totem Movie Player normally find the right codec
    for you (for example, see [Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps](ch14.html#installing_mp3_support_for_audio_apps
    "Installing MP3 Support for Audio Apps") in [Installing MP3 Support for Audio
    Apps](ch14.html#installing_mp3_support_for_audio_apps "Installing MP3 Support
    for Audio Apps")). However, if they fail, try installing the *Ubuntu restricted
    extras* package—this package contains a lot of extra codecs. Once the package
    is installed, close and reopen your audio/video file and see whether it plays.
    If it still won’t play, you can try using a different program, which might have
    the right codec built in. Try installing the MPlayer Media Player or VLC media
    player—both of these programs have support for a wide range of formats.

    of availability of suitable open source alternatives. If accelerated drivers exist
    for your card, you can install more powerful (but possibly less open source) drivers
    by opening Hardware Drivers from the Dash, selecting the graphics driver from

    the right permissions to delete it (see [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. A Tidy

    folder in which the file is stored, choose **Properties**, and select the **Permissions**

    message that Firefox is running in the background so you can’t open a new window.
    This is no good because you want a Firefox window that you can see! If this happens,
    open a Terminal, type **`killall firefox`**, and press enter. (The command is
    case sensitive, so be sure you’re typing in all lowercase.) This will force Firefox
    to shut down immediately. With that done, try to open Firefox again, and the window
    should pop up as normal. If it still isn’t working, try following the advice at

    slowly. Burning a CD, installing software, and converting music files to a different
    format all tend to strain your system, so you shouldn’t be surprised if things
    feel a little sluggish when something like that is running. But what if your computer
    is running slowly even if you’re not doing anything intensive? You can investigate
    the cause of the slowdown by opening the System Monitor with the Dash. Select
    the Resources tab and check your CPU (processor) usage—if it’s around 100 percent,
    then a program running in the background is probably responsible for the problem
    (for example, the one in [Figure 22-14](ch22.html#the_system_monitor_comma_showing_the_gwi
    "Figure 22-14. The System Monitor, showing the Gwibber service program using an
    unhealthy 94 percent of the processor for a long period of time")). Choose the
    Processes tab and click the % CPU column heading once or until it has a down arrow
    next to it. This will sort the list of programs in order of how much of the processor
    they are using. The one that’s using all of the CPU should appear at the top of
    the list.

    its CPU usage by itself. After all, maybe some system software is running a scan
    or dealing with some other maintenance operation. If the CPU usage stays high,
    the program might have gotten stuck, so select it and click **End Process** to
    force it to close. Your system should return to its usual speed within a few seconds.

    that something is overusing your hard disk instead. Programs that do this almost
    always finish what they’re doing within 5 or 10 minutes, so you should probably
    ride it out. If the sluggishness persists, the easiest way to fix the problem
    is to restart the computer.

    convenient, but if you find an important file, it’s worth it.
