    a giant squirt gun that cut out tennis shoe insoles with a high pressure jet of

- en: Since it was the first one ever made, we spent a lot of time tuning it. About
    a year. We had a deal with the tennis shoe maker who was buying it. They would
    give us free raw material to test with if we sent the cut pieces back to them.

    always used the same test size: 9 right. We dutifully boxed up the cut pieces
    and sent them to the tennis shoe maker so that they could make shoes out of them.
    Or so we thought.'
