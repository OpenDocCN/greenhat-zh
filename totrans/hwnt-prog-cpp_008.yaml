    learning how to program. It's designed to print an simple answer. But things don't
    quite go right.

- en: I taught programming for a while. At the time, I didn't know much about teaching
    and found it hard to gauge how much homework to give the class. One time, I was
    stopped by the Fort Worth police because my homework was too hard. True story.

  zh: 我曾经教过一段时间编程。当时，我对教学知之甚少，发现很难判断应该给学生布置多少作业。有一次，因为我的作业太难，我被沃斯堡警察拦了下来。这是真的。
- en: I was driving through the streets of Fort Worth and stopped for a red light.
    A police car pulled up beside me. I looked at the officer. He looked at me for
    a moment and then motioned for me to roll down my window. I admit I was a little
    worried. After all, I was driving an unrestored '58 Chevy and the muffler had
    fallen out three times so far.

  zh: 我正在沃斯堡的街道上开车，停在红灯前。一辆警车停在我旁边。我看着警官，他看了我一会儿，然后示意我摇下车窗。我承认我有点担心。毕竟，我开的是一辆未修复的1958年雪佛兰，排气管已经掉落过三次了。
- en: I rolled down my window as directed, and he leaned over to me and shouted, "Steve,
    your homework is too hard this week."

- en: That's when I learned that one of my students worked for the Fort Worth Police
    Department. Needless to say, I gave the class an extra week to turn in their homework.
