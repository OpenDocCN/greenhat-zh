    learning how to program. It's designed to print an simple answer. But things don't
    quite go right.

- en: I taught programming for a while. At the time, I didn't know much about teaching
    and found it hard to gauge how much homework to give the class. One time, I was
    stopped by the Fort Worth police because my homework was too hard. True story.

- en: I was driving through the streets of Fort Worth and stopped for a red light.
    A police car pulled up beside me. I looked at the officer. He looked at me for
    a moment and then motioned for me to roll down my window. I admit I was a little
    worried. After all, I was driving an unrestored '58 Chevy and the muffler had
    fallen out three times so far.

    your homework is too hard this week."

    Department. Needless to say, I gave the class an extra week to turn in their homework.
