This chapter describes the components that go into a wireless network and offers advice about deciding which components will best meet your needs. As you read the descriptions of features and functions in access points, network adapters, and antennas, remember that the marketplace for wireless networking equipment is both extremely competitive, and rapidly changing. If one manufacturer offers an access point or network adapter with a hot new feature, you can expect that same feature to show up in competing products within a few months or less. Therefore, this chapter does not discuss specific brands or models; by the time you read this, any such recommendation would be wildly out of date.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="everybody_speaks_the_same_language_more_"/>Everybody Speaks the Same Language (More or Less)</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we talk about specific features <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0261"/>and functions, it may be useful to review the rules—and the realities—about using equipment made by more than one manufacturer in the same wireless network. It can be done, but it's not quite as simple as the people at the Wi-Fi Alliance would have you believe.</p><p>Dozens <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0262"/>of companies make equipment that qualifies for Wi-Fi certification. To receive that certification, each device must undergo interoperability testing by the Alliance's independent testing lab. If an access point or network adapter carries a Wi-Fi logo, it has passed an extensive series of tests to confirm that it works with previously certified <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0263"/>hardware from several other vendors.</p><p>Access points and network adapters from different manufacturers may look different on the outside, and each maker provides its own configuration software, but the radio circuits inside are all pretty similar. Adapters that carry many brand names are actually made under contract by other companies, and just about everybody uses one of just a few standard chip sets.</p><p>In other words, it's possible to use any combination of Wi-Fi–certified adapters and access points together in the same network as long as they all follow the same specification (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11a, or 802.11g). The critical word in that last sentence is <span class="emphasis"><em>possible</em></span>. In practice, certification really means that a group of technicians who are intimately familiar with the internal workings of Wi-Fi networks can get a mixed-vendor network to operate properly in a carefully run series of tests under tightly controlled laboratory conditions.</p><p>Does that mean that a homeowner or the IT person in a small business who has never installed a wireless network can get that same combination of products to work? Oh, probably, but maybe not on the first attempt. It may take a lot of time and aggravation to set all the configuration options to the correct values. It's almost always a safe bet that devices from different makers will have different default settings. For example, some systems use short preambles as the default, and others use long preambles; some configurations request encryption keys as ASCII characters, but others might want them in hexadecimal. You can make all this stuff work together, but it might be a somewhat painful experience.</p><p>As a general rule, it's almost always easier to equip your entire network with hardware from a single manufacturer because the configuration settings and options will all be the same, but that's not always possible or even the best choice. You can control the brands of access points in your own network, and you can buy the same brand of external network adapters for your desktop computers, but eventually one of the users in your office network (and you can probably predict who it will be, can't you?) will come to you with a Wi-Fi adapter made by somebody you've never heard of, and they'll expect it to connect to your network. Maybe the adapter showed up at a garage sale or a swap meet, or maybe it came with a shiny new laptop computer. Or maybe it's the one your daughter's school recommended for the on-campus network. And you have little or no control over the make and model of the internal adapters built into a laptop computer or the base station used by a public hot spot. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0264"/>For one reason or another, you'll eventually have to integrate hardware and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0265"/>software from more than one maker into the same network.</p><p>The information in this book will help you to understand exactly what you need to do to make everything work together, but when you're building your own Wi-Fi network, you can reduce the number of headaches by using equipment from a single source.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-7"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>One more point is worth mentioning here: When you buy a Wi-Fi adapter, you generally get what you pay for.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="network_adapters-id001"/>Network Adapters</h1></div></div></div><p>A network adapter is the interface between a computer and a network. In a wireless network, the adapter contains a radio transmitter that sends data from the computer to the network and a receiver that detects incoming radio signals that contain data from the network and passes it along to the computer. The computer's operating system treats a wireless adapter just like any other network interface.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0267"/></p><p>If you only plan to use Wi-Fi to connect your computer to the Internet through existing Wi-Fi hot spots in public locations, such as libraries, coffee shops, and so forth, a network adapter (along with the software to support it) is the only new hardware you need to add to your computer. If you want to set up your own home or office network, you'll also need one or more access points.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0268"/>Built-in Wi-Fi adapters are standard features of new laptop computers. If your laptop already has a wireless interface, there's generally no reason to replace it until a new Wi-Fi specification, such as the 802.11n standard, becomes available—and perhaps not even then if you're satisfied with your existing equipment. So choosing a new adapter is particularly important for owners of desktop computers and older laptops. If you have an older laptop without a built-in adapter, you can add Wi-Fi capability by installing a plug-in adapter on a PC Card or connecting a USB adapter.</p><p>Most new Wi-Fi network adapters automatically recognize signals that use all three Wi-Fi specifications (or all four, after 802.11n comes out). When the adapter detects a signal from an access point, it identifies the signal type and uses the same specification to exchange data with that access point.</p><p>You should consider several things when you select an interface adapter: the physical package (the form factor), the type of antenna (internal or external? directional or not?), compatibility with the network's access points and other nodes in the network, and compatibility with the computer's operating system. And of course, you should also consider all the standard issues that apply to any piece of computer hardware or software: ease of use, security, quality of technical support, and other users' experiences with the product and the company.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="form_factor"/>Form Factor</h2></div></div></div><p>In most cases, the wireless <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0269"/>adapter plugs into one of the computer's high-speed I/O ports—either an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0270"/>internal expansion card slot, a socket on a laptop's motherboard, a PCMCIA (PC Card) socket, or a USB port. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0271"/>Network adapters for PDAs usually fit into <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0272"/>CompactFlash or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0273"/>SDIO (Secure Digital Input/Output) sockets.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0274"/></p><p>Each type of adapter has its own advantages and drawbacks. The choice of a particular package depends on the computer you will use with the adapter and the way you expect to use it. For example, if you want to connect a laptop computer to the network, an internal adapter or a PC Card is usually the best option because it's easy to install, it doesn't take up much space, and it doesn't force you to carry a special cable. But in a desktop system, a USB adapter is often a better choice.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="internal_adapters"/>Internal Adapters</h3></div></div></div><p>Almost all new laptop computers have an adapter module on a mini-PCI card mounted directly onto the motherboard with one or more antennas inside the clamshell section of the case that also holds the display screen. Even if you choose to save money by ordering a laptop without the adapter, the computer probably has an antenna, so you can install a Wi-Fi module later.</p><p>The obvious advantage of an internal adapter is that it doesn't force a user to carry (and possibly forget or lose) yet another accessory item along with the computer. The disadvantage, if there is one, is that it's not practical to move the same adapter to a different computer when it's time to repair or replace the original machine. If the backup unit doesn't have an internal adapter (which is possible because it's probably older than the primary unit), the user or the network manager will either have to provide a separate adapter on a PC Card, connect through a USB cable, or go without wireless access to the local network and the Internet.</p><p>A built-in adapter adds about as much to the cost of a new laptop as you would pay for a Wi-Fi adapter on a separate PC Card. It doesn't make sense to replace your current laptop just to get the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0275"/>internal wireless adapter, but when it's time to look for a new computer, it's a feature worth having.</p><p>If your computer does have an internal wireless adapter, there's an easy way to disable the adapter when you aren't using it. Most laptops use either a physical on/off switch or a pair of FN keys to turn the internal adapter on and off. If you don't turn it off when it's not in use, the radio unit will drain your computer's battery more quickly than necessary, and it will produce radio signals that can interfere with other users of the same unlicensed 2.4 GHz frequencies. Depending on the software your computer uses, leaving the wireless radio running can also expose you to security risks because your computer may connect to networks without your knowledge.</p><p>The internal adapter mounts onto the computer's motherboard with special connectors for the internal antenna. Lenovo calls this a <span class="emphasis"><em>field replaceable unit (FRU)</em></span>; other makers have similar descriptions for parts that are easy to remove and replace. When new adapters that support the 802.11n specification and other adapters that support both Wi-Fi and 3G wireless or WiMAX on a single card become available, it will be possible to remove the existing adapter and install a new one by following instructions supplied by the laptop's manufacturer.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0276"/></p><p>Most laptop manufacturers limit the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0277"/>internal adapters you can use to those certified by the manufacturer, the FCC, and other regulatory agencies. When you buy a new <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0278"/>internal adapter, make sure to check both the manual and your computer manufacturer's website to be sure that model adapter works with your model of laptop, or purchase the adapter from the company that made your computer.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="pc_cards"/>PC Cards</h3></div></div></div><p>If your laptop computer does not have an internal Wi-Fi adapter, you can add one on a PCMCIA card. Just about every maker of Wi-Fi devices has at least one PC Card adapter in its product line.</p><p>Wireless adapters on PC Cards are compact and don't add much weight to a portable computer, which are both important features. However, it's important to remove the adapter from the computer when you don't need a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0279"/>network link. Otherwise, the adapter might continue to radiate unwanted signals and possibly allow an intruder to connect to your computer without your knowledge. A Wi-Fi adapter that is not in use also places a small but unnecessary drain on the computer's battery.</p><p>PC Card adapters all look pretty much the same because they all have to fit into a computer's PCMCIA socket. However, some adapters have more features and better <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0280"/>performance than others. Once again, you generally get what you pay <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0281"/>for. As <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#a_d-link_wireless_ethernet_adapter_with_" title="Figure 4-1. A D-Link wireless Ethernet adapter with an internal antenna">Figure 4-1</a> shows, they're about the size of a credit card with a multipin connector at one end and a plastic cover for the internal antenna or a connector for an external antenna at the other end.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_d-link_wireless_ethernet_adapter_with_"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3160"/><img alt="A D-Link wireless Ethernet adapter with an internal antenna" src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254885.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 4-1. A D-Link wireless Ethernet adapter with an internal antenna</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>There are two main types of PC Cards. <span class="emphasis"><em>PCMCIA</em></span>, the original standard, is a slower 16-bit card. Found on older laptops, PCMCIA slots can only support 802.11b speeds. More modern laptops have <span class="emphasis"><em>CardBus</em></span> support, which looks nearly identical to a PCMCIA connector but supports higher speed 32-bit cards such as 802.11a/g/n. Laptops purchased from the late 1990s onward should have <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0282"/>CardBus support. Laptops made after 2006 might have a third type of adapter slot, called <span class="emphasis"><em>ExpressCard</em></span>, either as a replacement <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0283"/>for the PC Card socket or as an additional feature. This high-speed slot uses a physically different card and is not compatible with previous cards.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0284"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0285"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0286"/></p><p>Most PC Card adapters include one or two <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0287"/>indicator lights on the section of the adapter that extends beyond the end of the PCMCIA slot. One of these indicators lights when the adapter is receiving power from the computer and the other lights when the adapter detects an active radio link from an access point or another node in an ad hoc network.</p><p>Many PC Card adapters contain two internal antennas with a diversity system that constantly compares the quality of the incoming signals from each antenna and automatically selects the stronger one. Even though the two antennas inside a PC Card are only an inch or two apart, the improvement over a single antenna can be substantial.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0288"/>Network adapters <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0289"/>on PC Cards usually have built-in omnidirectional diversity antennas, but some manufacturers also offer versions with connectors for external antennas. The choice of an internal versus external antenna is always a trade-off. In most cases, the internal antenna is a lot easier to use with a portable computer because it doesn't force you to carry a separate antenna and cable. But it's much easier to adjust the exact location of an antenna at the end of a cable instead of the side or back of a computer that you must place in a position where you can comfortably see the screen and reach the keyboard. If you want to link to an access point from the extreme edges of a network's coverage area or if you're operating in a location with a lot of interference, a separate high-gain directional antenna can give you better and more reliable network <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0290"/>performance than the antennas built into most PC Cards. If your usual PC Card adapter does not have an external antenna input connector, you might want to remove it and use a USB adapter with a high-gain antenna when you're trying to connect from a fringe location.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="usb_adapters"/>USB Adapters</h3></div></div></div><p>If your computer has a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port, as most desktop and laptop computers built since about 1999 do, a wireless USB adapter might be the best way to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. The adapter connects to the computer through a cable or directly into the computer itself, so it's never a problem to move the whole adapter (with its built-in antenna) to the position that provides the best network performance. Even if the optimal location is on top of a bookcase or filing cabinet or on the floor under your computer table, the location of the adapter won't interfere with your ability to use the computer. It's a lot easier to connect a USB adapter to a desktop computer than to use an adapter on an internal expansion card because you don't have to take apart the computer to install a USB device.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0291"/></p><p>USB adapters come in many shapes and sizes depending on the design and marketing philosophies of the manufacturer. Most USB adapters have captive antennas that are often mounted on hinges or swivels that allow a user to make fine adjustments to their positions. Because the antennas <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0292"/>on USB adapters are usually larger and easier to manipulate than the antennas in PC Card adapters, you can expect somewhat better signal quality through a USB device (but remember that you <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0293"/>won't notice any improvement over the threshold that provides a full-speed connection).</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#wireless_usb_adapters_are_stand-alone_de" title="Figure 4-2. Wireless USB adapters are stand-alone devices that connect to the computer through a cable.">Figure 4-2</a> shows a wireless USB adapter with a hinged antenna made by Linksys. Like the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0294"/>adapters on PC Cards, most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0295"/>USB adapters take their power from the computer so they don't require a separate battery or an external power supply.</p><p>Other USB Wi-Fi adapters are compact modules similar to flash drives, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#compact_usb_wi-fi_adapters_are_small_and" title="Figure 4-3. Compact USB Wi-Fi adapters are small and convenient, but they might not reach as far as other adapters.">Figure 4-3</a>. These adapters are small and easy to throw into your portable computer's bag as an alternative to a PC Card, but they often have lower maximum transmitter power, which translates to less signal range than either a PC Card or a larger USB adapter, so they are more likely to drop an active connection in marginal reception conditions than other adapters.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0296"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="wireless_usb_adapters_are_stand-alone_de"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3268"/><img alt="Wireless USB adapters are stand-alone devices that connect to the computer through a cable." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254596.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 4-2. Wireless USB adapters are stand-alone devices that connect to the computer through a cable.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="figure"><a id="compact_usb_wi-fi_adapters_are_small_and"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3276"/><img alt="Compact USB Wi-Fi adapters are small and convenient, but they might not reach as far as other adapters." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254954.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 4-3. Compact USB Wi-Fi adapters are small and convenient, but they might not reach as far as other adapters.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="expansion_cards_for_desktop_computers"/>Expansion Cards for Desktop Computers</h3></div></div></div><p>Many internal wireless adapters for desktop systems are actually PC Cards mounted in PCMCIA sockets that fit a PCI expansion slot on the computer's motherboard. The adapter fits a slot in one of the mounting plates on the back of the computer. This approach offers several advantages for the manufacturers: They can use the same PC Card adapter that they sell separately for use in laptops combined with a socket that they obtain and re-label from some third party, and the metal housing of the PC Card provides an effective shield that keeps the radio signals away from the inside of the computer.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0297"/></p><p>But it would be difficult to find a worse place to locate the antenna for a wireless adapter. If the adapter has a built-in antenna, you can't easily move it to a different position to improve the signal quality; if the adapter has an antenna socket, the antenna cable (or the antenna itself) is likely to become tangled with the computer's other cables. The card sticks out from the back of the computer cabinet where you can't see the indicator lights. The backs of most desktop computers are often rats' nests of other cables and connectors that can all affect the radio's radiation pattern. And the computer's metal backplane may act as either an obstruction or a source of multipath interference between the adapter and the nearest access point. Of course, it's entirely possible that a PCI adapter will <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0298"/>perform flawlessly, right out of the box, in spite of all those potential problems. Don't assume that it won't work until you have actually tried it in your own network, especially when the adapter was supplied with your computer. But when you're adding Wi-Fi to an existing desktop computer, a USB adapter is almost always a better choice because it's more flexible and easier to install.</p><p>If you do encounter connection problems, there are a couple of ways to work around them. If the computer has a USB port, removing (or turning off) the internal adapter and installing a wireless USB adapter is the obvious solution. Even if there's no USB port on the outside of the computer, it's possible that the motherboard has a USB port; if it does, you can use an inexpensive cable and bracket to bring the port out to the backplane. For older motherboards that don't have USB ports, you'll need an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0299"/>expansion card with one or more add-in USB ports.</p><p>If signal quality is a problem, look for an adapter that has a connector for an external antenna rather than an antenna built into the adapter itself. Adapters with external antenna connectors are available from Buffalo and Proxim Wireless, among others.</p><p>If you're committed to using a built-in adapter, you might want to consider installing a PC Card reader or socket that mounts in a spare external drive bay on the front of a desktop or tower computer network and a separate PC Card adapter, rather than a socket, on the backplane. This makes the adapter much easier to reach than it would be at the back of the computer, and it moves the adapter away from the tangle of other cables and plugs behind the computer. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0300"/>Actiontec PC750 is among the most widely available front-mounting PC Card readers.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-8"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When you shop for a PC Card reader, make sure it's designed to work with network adapters and not just with flash cards and other storage devices</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0301"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e3319"/></p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="internal_vs_external_antennas"/>Internal vs. External Antennas</h2></div></div></div><p>Most wireless network adapters come with captive omnidirectional antennas. For most users in most situations, these built-in antennas send and receive a strong, clean data stream between an access point and a nearby computer. But if network adapters with built-in antennas don't provide a good enough signal because of distance, obstructions, or interference from other radio signals, an external antenna may be the best way to solve the problem. As a rule of thumb, you can expect an external antenna to provide a signal at least 15 percent stronger than the antenna built into a PC Card adapter; special <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0302"/>high-gain <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0303"/>directional antennas can offer even better performance. This translates to either faster data exchange or a greater maximum distance between the computer and the access point.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0304"/></p><p>If you identify a dead spot in your coverage area, a network adapter with a connector for an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0305"/>external <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0306"/>antenna instead of a built-in <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0307"/>antenna may be the right choice for a computer that remains in that location. But it's a lot more cumbersome to set up a separate antenna before you can log in to the network, so PC Cards <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0308"/>with built-in antennas are generally the best choice for laptops and other portables.</p><p>As an alternative to an external antenna, consider a USB adapter with a built-in antenna. You can place the adapter anywhere within the length of the USB cable and move it around to find the best signal.</p><p>Remember that there are two antennas in the link between a base station and a wireless network adapter—one at the access point and one at the computer. A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0309"/>high-gain <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0310"/>antenna at either end will have the same impact on the link, so when you're operating your own network, it will be equally effective to replace the standard antenna on either the access point or the network interface. However, a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0311"/>directional antenna will focus most of the signal in one direction, so a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0312"/>directional access point antenna can reduce the quality of links to other network nodes, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#different_combinations_of_directional_an" title="Figure 4-4. Different combinations of directional and non-directional antennas can change the coverage area of a network.">Figure 4-4</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="different_combinations_of_directional_an"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3399"/><img alt="Different combinations of directional and non-directional antennas can change the coverage area of a network." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254175.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 4-4. Different combinations of directional and non-directional antennas can change the coverage area of a network.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>You can find more information about external antennas later in this chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0313"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="interoperability"/>Interoperability</h2></div></div></div><p>Wi-Fi certification is supposed to assure that <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0314"/>network adapters and access points from different manufacturers will work together seamlessly. But there are a few features and configuration options that can make it difficult or impossible to exchange data between certain combinations of hardware. For example, some devices come with 128-bit encryption keys, but others use 64-bit keys. If an access point expects 128 bits, it won't work with the smaller key.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0315"/></p><p>The easiest way to avoid this is to acquire all of your hardware from the same source, and make sure you're not using incompatible models (such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0316"/>network cards with proprietary "turbo" features). Otherwise, read the specifications carefully, test every new component type with the rest of your network (and one or more public hot spots) as soon as you receive them, and make sure your vendor will accept a return if it isn't compatible.</p><p>Adapters and access points that use a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0317"/>prerelease version of the new 802.11n (pre-n) standard are likely to have problems working with devices from other manufacturers because each company is using its best guess about the exact specifications of the new version. So it's best to avoid pre-n equipment unless you have complete control of all the computers that will connect to your network. And even if you do, remember that you may have to upgrade or replace your pre-n devices after the final standard has been adopted. Devices that advertise upgradeability to the final 802.11n standard may be a better choice than devices that do not because it means you will not have to buy new hardware later.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_drivers_for_your_adapter"/>Finding Drivers for Your Adapter</h2></div></div></div><p>Like every other peripheral device you use with your computer, a wireless network adapter requires specific driver software that contains the controls and interfaces that allow the adapter to exchange data with the computer's central processor. You can safely assume that the software disk supplied with the adapter includes a driver for Microsoft Windows XP and probably <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0318"/>for Windows Vista, but that won't do any good if the computer you're trying to link to your network uses Linux or some flavor of Unix. If you're a Macintosh user, Apple's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0319"/>AirPort family of adapters is usually the best choice.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0320"/></p><p>If you don't get the right driver software with your network adapter, you'll have to either find it someplace else or choose a different adapter that supports your operating system. The first place to look is the manufacturer's technical support website, which probably offers a variety of drivers for free download. It you can't find anything there, send a request for information to the manufacturer's technical support center; they might know of a third-party driver for your operating system or invite you to help test a new driver they haven't yet released. If that fails, try an online search for <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;adapter make and model&gt; &lt;operating system&gt; driver</em></span>.</p><p>If you're a Windows user, you must install new drivers when you upgrade from Windows XP (or some earlier version) to Windows Vista. Some drivers are supplied in the Windows Vista package, but many others were not yet available when Vista was released. Again, the best source for new drivers is the adapter manufacturer's website. If your laptop has an internal adapter, look for new drivers on the website maintained by the laptop maker or importer.</p><p>Most manufacturers work closely with Microsoft, and when new drivers are available, they often distribute them through the Windows Update website. This is the same site that Microsoft uses to distribute its own updates and patches, but the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0321"/>Automatic Updates feature does not load new drivers unless you specifically request them.</p><p>To check <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0322"/>for new drivers, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0323"/>Internet Explorer web browser.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0324"/>Tools menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Update</strong></span>.

Many adapters contain similar internal circuits, so it may be possible to use a driver with an adapter that was originally created <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0327"/>for a different brand. For example, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0328"/>Xircom CWE1100 adapter uses the same drivers as similar adapters from Cisco. See <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. WI-FI FOR LINUX AND UNIX">Chapter 7</a> for Linux and Unix driver sources from user groups and online archives. Without a driver, your adapter is only useful as a paperweight. If you can't find the right driver for your operating system, look for a different adapter. This should not be a problem unless you're using a very old or very cheap adapter, in which case a new one will almost certainly offer more features and better performance than your old clunker.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ease_of_use"/>Ease of Use</h2></div></div></div><p>Every wireless adapter comes with a utility program that detects nearby Wi-Fi signals and sets the operating mode (infrastructure or ad hoc), the channel number, and all of the other configuration options that must match the settings for the other nodes on the same <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0329"/>network.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0330"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-9"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>It's always a good idea to look for the most recent software and driver updates on the adapter manufacturer's website.

So you might have two or three different ways to accomplish the same thing.

Some use a single window with all the options in one place while others split things into several separate sections. Some display signal strength and quality as numeric values, but others show the same data in graphic form.</p><p>Under ideal conditions, a user would never have to look at the internal workings of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0331"/>configuration utility because most modern Wi-Fi software automatically matches the adapter's settings to the signal it receives from each access point or ad hoc network. The configuration utility and the status display should both be easy to understand and use. They all contain the same information and options, so the choice comes down to a subjective evaluation: Can you look at the configuration window and understand how to choose a connection?

However, the quality and usefulness of that support varies wildly from one vendor to another. If you can't get the information you need from the manufacturer, you should find a different supplier.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0341"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0342"/></p><p>At a minimum, an adequate level of technical support should include an accurate and clearly written user's manual, a support center that answers specific questions by telephone and email, a website with answers to frequently asked questions, and a download center that offers the latest versions of device drivers, configuration utilities, and status display software.</p><p>Each adapter and access point should come with a detailed <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0343"/>user's manual that contains clearly written instructions for installing, configuring, and using the equipment. It's always a good idea to look over the manual before you buy any piece of computer equipment; there's no excuse for a manual with confusing instructions or text that seems to have been badly translated <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0344"/>from colloquial Swahili by somebody whose native language was an obscure dialect of Gaelic.</p><p>Even the greatest manual ever written won't include the answers to every possible question, so it should also be possible to telephone or send email to a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0345"/>technical support center. It's always nice when tech support has a toll-free telephone number, but it's not essential—you probably paid more for the product to support that "free" service. You should be able to reach a live human technician within a minute or two, or if you call at a busy time, you should be able to leave your telephone number for a callback within a few hours. There is never any excuse for endless time on hold (with or without sappy music), or incomprehensible automated menus that never have the answers to your specific questions.</p><p>When you send a question by email, you should receive an acknowledgment within an hour or less, even if it's only an automated "Thanks for your question. We will reply with a complete answer as soon as possible." You should expect an answer to your question no later than the next business day.</p><p>And of course, the people who answer your questions should provide information that actually solves your problem. Bad information is worse than no information at all.</p><p>Most computer hardware and software companies have technical support <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0346"/>websites that contain answers to the most common questions they receive from users. If you have access to the Web when you need a quick answer, that's often the least painful way to find it. The website should also include a download center where you can find copies of the latest drivers and related software for every product that the company has ever sold, including discontinued models.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="reputation"/>Reputation</h2></div></div></div><p>It's almost always helpful to learn about other people's experiences with a wireless adapter (or anything else you might be planning to buy) before you spend your own money.

It's not always safe to take every review and every horror story at face value, but when you see or hear a dozen or more reports about a driver that crashed Windows or a PC Card that overheated, you can often assume that there's some kind of pattern emerging.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="adapters_for_ad_hoc_networks"/>Adapters for Ad Hoc Networks</h1></div></div></div><p>In an ad hoc network, every network adapter exchanges data with every other node through direct links without an access point acting as a central node. Ad hoc networks are useful for small, isolated networks and direct peer-to-peer file sharing. For example, somebody who uses a laptop computer on the road and a desktop computer in the office can set up an ad hoc network to transfer files between the two. Or two laptop owners might use an ad hoc connection to share files.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0352"/></p><p>Ad hoc wireless networks that connect two or more network nodes without the use of an access point are far less common than infrastructure networks, but they are part of the 802.11 specifications. As such, just about every network interface adapter and wireless configuration program offers an ad hoc network option.</p><p>In general, any network adapter with a Wi-Fi logo will work well in an ad hoc network. It's essential that all of the nodes in the network are configured for ad hoc operation, and that all of the other configuration options match as well. Connecting directly to another computer should be no more difficult than connecting to an access point.</p><p>The specifications do not provide a standard for 802.11g speeds on an ad hoc network; however, some manufacturers support higher speeds while others adhere to the 11Mbit limitation described in the specification. Generally, if you need the higher speeds of 802.11g for a permanent network, ad hoc isn't the best choice.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="dual-purpose_adapters"/>Dual-Purpose Adapters</h1></div></div></div><p>Wi-Fi networking is wildly popular, but it's not the only wireless technology out there. Several other systems are available, including <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0353"/>Bluetooth, which provides very <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0354"/>short-range connections for computer peripheral devices and accessories such as headphones and keyboards, and the 3G mobile data services that we'll discuss in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. ALTERNATIVES TO WI-FI: WIRELESS BROADBAND DATA">Chapter 13</a>. Each offers solutions to a somewhat different set of problems, and each fills a different market niche.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0355"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm4_d1e3778"/></p><p>Several manufacturers have announced new products that combine a Wi-Fi network interface adapter with an interface for some other wireless service. Some can detect and use both Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth. Still others might combine access to Wi-Fi LANs with 3G cellular data or WiMAX. The benefits of a combined network interface are obvious—one device is more convenient to carry and install than two, and it provides access to more networks and services. And because the same radio transmitter and receiver handles both services, the potential for interference is also reduced.</p><p>An ideal dual-service network adapter would automatically detect radio signals from all compatible networks within range and allow a user to set up an instant connection to any of them regardless of the type of link the network is using. The cost of this combined adapter should be only slightly more than the price of an adapter that only recognizes one networking protocol. Such a perfect wireless networking device may actually appear some time in the next few years.</p><p>The latest PDA devices, such as Apple's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0356"/>iPhone, come close to this ideal. When the device is within range of a high-speed Wi-Fi signal, it automatically connects. But when there's no Wi-Fi signal nearby, the device uses a slower 3G network, instead.</p><p>The added cost of a dual-mode adapter might be justified if you know that you will be using both of the network services that the adapter supports. Like most other electronic equipment, these <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0357"/>adapters will come down in price over time, so there's not much reason to buy one unless you have an immediate need for it.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="access_points-id001"/>Access Points</h1></div></div></div><p>Most wireless network interface adapters perform just one function: They exchange data between a computer and a network. But access points offer a wide variety of features and functions. They're available as simple access points and in combination with hubs, switches and routers for wired connections to nearby computers and other devices. And there's a whole category of wireless access points for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0358"/>home networks called <span class="emphasis"><em>residential gateways</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0359"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0360"/></p><p>The physical design of an access point is less important than the design of an interface adapter because access points don't have to fit into a computer's card slot or an expansion bay. Some are built into simple rectangular boxes while others are in odd-shaped enclosures that may look more distinctive. The appearance of the package is less important than the features and functions inside, especially when the access point will be placed out of sight in a closet or hidden behind a false ceiling. Regardless of the shape, most access points include mounting plates, brackets, or other hardware for attaching the device to a wall or shelf.</p><p>There are a handful of other general features that you might want to look for when you select an access point. If your site survey tells you that you will need high-gain antennas, or if you want to place an antenna outdoors or in some other isolated location, you should use an access point with an external antenna connector instead of a permanently mounted captive antenna. In a high-traffic network where you plan to use more than one radio channel at the same time, a single access point that contains two radio modules can replace two separate access points. And if the best location for your access point is not close to an AC power outlet, choose a model that offers an optional <span class="emphasis"><em>power over Ethernet</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>active Ethernet</em></span> feature.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0361"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0362"/></p><p>The best way to choose the type of access point to use in your network is to decide what kind of connections you're likely to need. Are you adding <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0363"/>wireless access to an existing wired network? Or do you want to provide some new wired links along with the wireless service? Do you want to use the wireless network to share Internet access? The answers to all of these questions will help you choose the right access point for your network.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="operating_standards"/>Operating Standards</h2></div></div></div><p>When you are designing a new Wi-Fi network for your home or office, where you can also select the network adapters for each computer that will connect to the network, you can use an access point that supports only one of the Wi-Fi standards. But if you want to provide Wi-Fi access to visitors or to the general public, your base station should support as many standards as possible. Several manufacturers offer dual-band <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0364"/>access points or routers that produce both 802.11a and 802.11g signals (an 802.11g access point will also work with an 802.11b adapter).

But when your network must cover a very large area (greater than about 100 feet in diameter), a space obstructed by walls, furniture, or other objects, or interference from other radios, you will probably have to add more access points.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0387"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0388"/></p><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0389"/>Wi-Fi specification includes a roaming function that automatically hands off a network link from one access point to another when the signal quality through the new access point is better than the original connection. Most home networks and many networks in very small businesses will need only one access point, so choosing an access point that supports roaming is only a problem for managers of large and complex networks.</p><p>After a network client associates with an access point, it automatically surveys all of the other radio channels to determine if some other access point operating on a different channel will provide a stronger or cleaner signal than the one it is currently using. When the client finds a channel that can support a faster link than the current one, it drops the old association and immediately associates with the best available signal source.</p><p>Therefore, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0390"/>access points with overlapping coverage areas should be set to different channel <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0391"/>numbers. For the least amount of interference from one access point to the next, the channel numbers of any pair of adjacent access points should be at least five channels apart.</p><p>In most cases, a network client will not associate with a different access point unless the client moves to a different location while the network link is active or the amount of traffic on the current channel increases. In other words, a hand off can occur when a user carries a laptop or PDA from one place to another and when it becomes necessary for the network to balance the load among all of the available access points.</p><p>As <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html#multiple_access_points_on_a_wired_lan_al" title="Figure 4-14. Multiple access points on a wired LAN allow wireless users to roam throughout a larger coverage area than any single access point can serve by itself.">Figure 4-14</a> shows, all of the access points must be connected together through a conventional wired LAN that might also include additional computers and servers that don't require a wireless connection.</p><p>In most cases, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0392"/>multiple access points should be placed to provide coverage that overlaps by about 30 percent from one access point to the next.

For example, you might see devices advertised as <span class="emphasis"><em>extended range</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>high-speed</em></span> access points.

The improved performance promised by these access points will only occur when you're using a compatible network adapter, which is probably only made by the same manufacturer who built the access point. When you try to connect to an enhanced access point from any other network device, the network performance will be no better than a less expensive access point without the enhanced features.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="external_antennas"/>External Antennas</h1></div></div></div><p>If you can establish a reliable high-speed data link to any location in your network's coverage area with the antennas built into your network adapters and the captive antennas attached to your access points, there is absolutely no reason to waste any time, money, or energy on external antennas. When you reach the maximum possible speed, better antennas won't move the data any faster.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0400"/></p><p>But when reception conditions are less than perfect, and when you want to push a radio signal as far as you possibly can, a separate antenna can cut through interference, increase data transfer speed, expand the network's coverage area, and establish reliable communication links in places where they would be little more than a rumor if you use adapters and access points with plain vanilla internal antennas.</p><p>At first glance, it would appear that the easiest way to improve the quality of a radio signal would be to crank up the power that comes out of the transmitter. Instead of the wimpy 30 milliwatts (0.030 of a watt) produced by most wireless adapters, why not boost it to 10 or 20 watts or more? Wouldn't that produce a much stronger signal?</p><p>Sure it would, but the FCC and the other agencies around the world that regulate radio services won't let you do it. More powerful radios would produce stronger signals that would create a lot more interference over wider areas, which would mean that fewer users could share the same piece of the radio spectrum. By comparison, the television station that uses channel 4 in New York City transmits with 100,000 watts of output power, but the nearest station that uses the same channel is in Boston, a few hundred miles away. On the other hand, the radios in a wireless LAN use less than a watt, so the signal is almost inaudible a few hundred feet away.</p><p>Since you can't increase the amount of power produced by the radio transmitters, the next best method for improving signal quality is to optimize the performance of the antennas.</p><p>Radio antennas come in two types: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0401"/>omnidirectional antennas that transmit and receive in all directions at equal strength and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0402"/>directional antennas that focus their energy and sensitivity in a specific direction. In a wireless LAN, an access point with an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0403"/>omnidirectional antenna is most useful when you want to cover a wide area. A network adapter with an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0404"/>omnidirectional antenna can communicate equally well with any nearby access point. If the coverage area you want to reach with your wireless LAN extends beyond the distance you can cover with internal omnidirectional antennas, you can expect to increase the coverage area by about 15 percent with an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0405"/>external antenna.</p><p>In other words, if the signal quality of your link begins to fade at a distance of 100 feet between a network node and the closest access point, you can extend the useful signal range to about 115 feet by using an external omnidirectional antenna on either the access point or the network adapter. If you use external antennas at both ends, you can expect to reach about 132 feet. Of course, that 100-foot value is just an easy-to-calculate example. The actual signal range of a pair of internal antennas might be very different depending on obstructions between the two devices and interference from other radio signals, but the 15 percent improvement rate for each antenna will remain about the same.</p><p>The shape of a directional antenna's coverage area and the amount of gain (signal strength from the transmitter and sensitivity to the receiver) depend on the exact design of each antenna. Some directional antennas can provide a moderate amount of gain over a broad pattern (like a floodlight) while others can focus three or four (or more) times as much gain over a much narrower area (like a spotlight).</p><p>Directional antennas can provide a huge improvement in signal quality over a tightly focused coverage area, and they can also reduce interference from null areas outside of that coverage pattern. Therefore, they can have several uses in a wireless LAN:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>They can allow a user outside the normal coverage area to join the network.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They can increase the effective coverage area served by an access point by limiting the coverage to one direction.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They can reduce or eliminate the effect of off-axis interference from other radio signals.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They can reduce the amount of interference that a wireless LAN creates for other radios.</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0406"/>Directional antennas come in many shapes and sizes.

The aperture angle is the section of a circle that contains the antenna's maximum power coverage or sensitivity. For example, if an antenna has an aperture angle of 45 degrees, the maximum coverage or sensitivity extends outward from the front of the antenna at a 45 degree angle.</p><p>Most manufacturers will tell you the beam width in more than one plane. This might be important information when you're planning to place an access point's antenna on a wall, roof, or tower and you want to exchange data with network nodes on the ground.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gain"/>Gain</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>gain</em></span> of an antenna is the ratio of the transmitting power or receiving sensitivity when compared to a standard <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0417"/>dipole antenna (a <span class="emphasis"><em>dipole</em></span> is a straight, center-fed, half-wavelength antenna, such as the T-shaped twin-lead antenna supplied with many FM radios and tuners). The gain is usually expressed as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0418"/>dbi (decibels over isotropic). An antenna with a high dbi value has more gain than one with a lower value.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0419"/></p><p>There's often a trade-off between an antenna's beam width and its gain. This occurs because an antenna with a tight aperture angle focuses the same amount of power (or sensitivity) into a smaller area.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="form_factor-id001"/>Form Factor</h3></div></div></div><p>A dipole antenna for a 2.4 GHz radio is only about an inch long, but the reflectors and other elements that add gain and directional characteristics might be much longer than that. Many antennas are supplied inside a protective cover that does not affect their performance, but it keeps the actual antenna clean and dry and makes it easier to mount the antenna on a pole or a wall.</p><p>Omnidirectional antennas are almost always vertical whips or shafts no more than two or three inches in diameter. Some high-gain omnis can be as much as two or three feet long. For indoor use, especially in rooms with dropped ceilings, a special omnidirectional ceiling mount antenna can be an excellent choice for a wireless network.</p><p>Directional antennas can take many shapes, including parabolic dishes <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0420"/>and panels that include a reflector behind the active part of the antenna; antennas that resemble a shorter version of a rooftop TV antenna; and patch or panel antennas with several radiating elements, usually within a flat enclosure that resembles a smoke detector or mounted on a swivel that makes it possible to aim the antenna more precisely.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="weatherproofing"/>Weatherproofing</h3></div></div></div><p>Outdoor antennas usually need some kind of protection from rain and snow and from ultraviolet radiation that can deteriorate the materials from which the antenna is constructed. Therefore, many manufacturers offer antennas with sealed elements inside weatherproof enclosures.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0421"/></p><p>A weatherproof enclosure doesn't serve any purpose indoors where the goal should be to make the antenna as unobtrusive as possible. Some antennas are advertised <span class="emphasis"><em>for indoor/outdoor use</em></span>, but the only thing they will do for an indoor installation is increase the cost.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0422"/></p><p>When you mount an antenna outside, remember to consider the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0423"/>damage that could occur if lightning strikes your antenna (or near your antenna). This is especially crucial for antennas mounted on rooftops and poles. Special in-line lightning arrestors are available that can prevent a lightning strike from traveling through the network wires to damage other equipment in your building.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_to_choose_an_antenna"/>How to Choose an Antenna</h2></div></div></div><p>It's important to remember that there's no good reason to install an antenna with more gain than you can actually use. If you can establish a clean link with a low-gain antenna, your network won't <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0424"/>perform any better or move data any faster just because the access point's antenna is sending and receiving stronger signals. In fact, the overall signal quality might not be as good with a better antenna because it will pick up more noise and interference from other networks and other 2.4 GHz devices.</p><p>The standard omnidirectional antenna should be your first choice unless you have a good reason to use something else. If you need a directional antenna, choose one that covers the area you want to reach as efficiently as possible. If you don't need to cover an enormous area, don't waste your money on a high-gain antenna. The least amount of gain necessary to reach all the nodes in your network will work as well or better than a bigger and more expensive antenna that pushes a signal out to places where nobody except unauthorized users will ever receive it.</p><p>It's always a good idea to buy your antennas from the same supplier as the radios that you will use with them, in order to prevent unpleasant finger-pointing between two or more vendors when something doesn't work properly. But if your network requires some kind of special antenna that you can't get from the people who make or sell your radios, don't be afraid to go to a specialist dealer.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="rolling_your_own"/>Rolling Your Own</h2></div></div></div><p>Some wireless network designers and experimenters have designed a whole class of home brew antennas for 2.4 GHz operation using such cheap and easily obtainable materials as an empty <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-4-0425"/>Pringles potato chips canister.

And you'll probably want to use an expensive piece of test equipment called a spectrum analyzer to aim the two antennas at each other.</p><p>If you don't have experience with this stuff, you'll either need to find help from somebody who does or spend a lot of time experimenting. If that's your idea of fun, have yourself a fine time.
