    "11.3.1 Why Use 3D Boxes?")**, Inkscape’s 3D Box tool is not intended to be a
    replacement for specialized 3D design applications. Inkscape is a drawing program—and
    as such, its 3D Box tool is best used as a *drawing aid*. This is what we’ll try
    to do in this simple tutorial.

- en: A “3D-correct” drawing is simply one that satisfies the rules of perspective
    drawing which have been well known to artists for many centuries. It does not
    need to exhibit perfectly realistic shading and texturing; it just has to get
    its lines and objects approximately correct with regard to angles and dimensions.

- en: Granted, some styles of drawing do not even need to have correct perspective;
    sometimes, intentional perspective distortions may have an artistic value of its
    own. Many artists have a knack for drawing 3D-correct art without using any technical
    aids. However, quite often you will notice perspective errors, ranging from barely
    noticeable to embarrassing, in pieces of art which would definitely do better
    without them. I think, therefore, that many artists—not only the beginners—would
    appreciate a quick and easy way to set up the perspective for a drawing without
    tedious manual measurements and helper lines. Let’s see how this task can be approached
    in Inkscape.

    the box and, if necessary, the vanishing points to adjust what you’ve drawn. The
    corner handles will let you resize your room; the four X/Y handles move in the
    X/Y plane by default and along the Z axis when ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg)
    is pressed, whereas the four Z handles, conversely, will move along the Z axis
    without ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg) and in the
    X/Y plane with ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg). The
    X-shaped central handle will move the entire room, again in the X/Y plane without
    ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg) and along the Z axis
    with ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg). Whenever moving
    a handle in X/Y, press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg)
    to restrict its movement to only X or only Y axis. Finally, dragging the vanishing
    points will reslant and resize the room to fit the changed perspective (**[11.3.3

    ones in X and Z (in other words, make Y vanishing point *finite*). Do this if
    you want your image to look “closer” and from a more emphatic perspective, as
    if viewed by a spider in the corner of the room instead of a human at a distance.
    Conversely, you can make two or three of the vanishing points infinite if what
    you’re after is a more detached, technical look “from afar”:'

    z-order of the boxes; their default style uses partial transparency so you can
    always see the edges of all boxes you created.) Note that the new box uses the
    same perspective (i.e., the same vanishing points) as the room box. Grab its lower
    left X/Y handle and drag it so it snaps to the lower left Z-edge of the room.
    That will be the foundation of the sofa; use the other corner handles to give

    a window aligns with a side of any other box?

    its front X/Y handle backward (along the X axis) to squeeze it into a thin layer;

    a second window, just duplicate the first one and ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg)-drag

    exact perspective-aligned copy of the first one. Using the same duplicate and

    the Z vanishing point), so that it protrudes outside of the room box:'

    A lot! Although I’m not going to model robot-like constructions out of parallelepipeds,
    I still want to make sure the height and bulkiness of a figure are correct in
    the drawing’s perspective, and an easy way to achieve this is with the 3D Box
    tool.
  prefs: []

- en: Here’s what I do. First, I add a tall and narrow box in the doorway—this will
    be our human number 1\. As before, I just duplicate the doorway box, squeeze it
    on the sides in the X/Y plane, and resize it so as to get a realistic proportion
    of the figure height and doorway height. (Ask someone to stand in a real doorway
    to get an idea.)

    it horizontally a bit along the X axis. This will be our second human standing

    serve as useful guides for actually drawing the human figures. If I were trying
    to achieve even better anatomic fidelity, I could use a stack of three boxes for
    the legs, body, and head for each human (unfortunately, however, you cannot drag
    several selected boxes in 3D space at once. You can only drag them one-byone in
    the current version of Inkscape).

    objects, such as the sofa and the humans, this is hardly possible, but even the
    walls and windows will benefit from some hand-drawn roughness and imperfections.
    Use the edges of the 3D boxes as general guides to keep an eye on, but otherwise
    draw as freely as you would draw without any guides at all, using your own manner
    and style of sketching. You also don’t need to trace *all* of the lines; some
    can be omitted, and some just hinted at by short partial strokes.

    overall composition and space relationships in your drawing while working on the
    details. I have described my own sketching style with the Calligraphic pen in
    another tutorial (**[20.6 Hatching](ch20s06.html "20.6 Hatching")**), so I won’t
    go into much detail here; since the focus of this tutorial is the use of the 3D
    Box tool, in this drawing I am even more sketchy than usual. Don’t try to copy
    me; you should try to work out a style which is most natural for you. After you’re
    done with the basic outlines, you can turn off the 3D layer to see how your image
    stands on its own merits, as shown in [Figure 21-8](ch21s04.html#when_sketching_is_completecomma_hide_the
