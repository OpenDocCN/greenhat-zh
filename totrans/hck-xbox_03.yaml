    of starter projects. The next chapters walk you through some elementary modifications
    and repairs that you can perform on your Xbox. These projects are designed and
    written for readers who have little or no experience with hardware hacking. More
    advanced topics on the Xbox can be found in later chapters.

    Xbox front panel with a blue LED. This project requires minimal soldering; most
    of the effort is in removing the front panel and the LED circuit assembly. Let’s
    get started!

    of around 3 volts and have a T-1 style case. Pay attention when buying your LEDs,
    because many blue and white LEDs are rated to work only at 5 volts. The LED used
    here is a Lumex SSL-LX3044USBC which you can buy through Digi-Key (www.digikey.com);
    part number 67-1747-ND. (For the budget-conscious, Digi-Key can send the LEDs
    via United States Postal service’s first class mail. Note that there is a $5 handling
    fee for orders through Digi-Key that are less than $25.)

- en: If Digi-Key’s minimum order restriction is a problem for you, Mouser Electronics
    (www.mouser.com) also has a line of blue LEDs, and they have no minimum order.
    An example part is the Kingbright blue LED in a T-1 case with a water clear lens;
    the Mouser stock number is 604-L7104PBC/H for the brighter, slightly higher voltage
    version, or 604-L7104QB/D for a version that operates at a lower voltage but with
    a lower rated brightness.

    LED functionality as well. The Xbox requires a common-cathode bi-color LED in
    a T-1 case with three leads. Unfortunately, bi-color LEDs with a blue element
    in the smaller T-1 case are very difficult to find.

    lead on both LEDs is abutting the remains of the original LED’s center lead, solder

    that the tip is sufficiently hot. The solder wire should melt instantly if the
    tip is hot enough. If the soldering iron is too cold, you will not be able to
    form a good joint and you run the risk of damaging the circuit board.

- en: Hold the hot iron tip against the blue LED’s lead and push the lead into the
    metal stub on the circuit card assembly. While the lead is heated, apply a touch
    of solder wire to the point where the blue LED lead meets the metal stub. The
    molten solder’s surface tension should cause the solder to wet the blue LED’s
    leads and the metal stub on the circuit board assembly. If this does not happen,
    remove the iron and apply a little bit of flux to the joint, and try again.

    to flow in one direction. This means that they will not work when put in backwards.
    Figure 3-9 illustrates the anatomy of an LED. The shorter lead on the side of
    the LED package with a small flat is called the cathode. The cathode must be connected
    to a potential more negative than the other lead, the anode, in order for the
    LED to function.

- en: Different LEDs characteristically require a different amount of forward voltage
    to turn on. Red LEDs typically require 1.7 volts, green LEDS require about 2.1
    volts, and blue LEDs require 3.5 volts and up. Early blue LEDs required almost
    5 volts of forward voltage, but advances in technology have decreased their voltage
    making them easier to integrate into battery-powered and low voltage electronics.
    When shopping for an LED for this project, be mindful of the required forward
    voltage. If you install a 5 volt blue LED, its light output will be very dim,
    since the maximum forward voltage generated by the Xbox drivers is around 3 volts.

- en: Do not hold the soldering iron tip against the metal stub for extended periods
    of time or it will melt the solder that holds the stub in place. You will know
    that the stub’s solder joint to the board has melted, when the stub starts to
    sway freely. If this happens, hold the soldering iron tip against the board and
    slowly drag the soldering iron tip away. Dragging the tip will prevent the stub
    from getting pulled out of the board with the iron. Wait for the stub to cool
    and bend the stub back into position.
