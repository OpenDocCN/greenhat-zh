- en: Whether you connect your computers and other devices to the network through
    cables or wireless links, your network must have some kind of control center that
    includes one or more hubs or switches for your wired Ethernet connections, an
    access point for Wi-Fi, or both. If you plan to connect your LAN to the Internet,
    the control center must also include a gateway router and a modem. This chapter
    explains how to assemble a control center and run cables between the control center
    and the computers, game consoles, printers, and other devices that make up your
    network.

    outlet. In places where you decide to use surface boxes, you can attach the outlet
    block to the baseboard with double-sided adhesive or wood screws. For wall plates,
    you must cut a hole in the wall and use a mounting bracket like the one shown
    in [Figure 6-1](ch06.html#use_a_mounting_bracket_to_attach_data_o "Figure 6-1. Use
    a mounting bracket to attach data outlet wall plates to a wall.") to attach the
    plate to the wall. If there's an electrical outlet on the same wall, measure the
    distance from the bottom of the plate to the floor and mount the data plate at
    exactly the same height. Remember to keep data outlets at least a foot away from
    the nearest electrical outlet. When you tighten the screws on the front of the
    mounting bracket, the wings inside the wall will turn and hold the bracket in
    place.

    cables and connectors are identified as Category 5 (CAT5), enhanced Category 5
    (CAT5e), or Category 6 (CAT6), depending on the amount of data that can pass through
    a cable and the cable''s sensitivity to interference. Unless you plan to install

    cables with connectors already attached. Pre-assembled data cables are often called
    *patch cords*, *patch cables*, or *jumper cables*. They''re available in many
    colors and in lengths ranging from 1 foot to 100 feet. Use different-colored patch
    cords with a switch or any other device that has lots of connections; multiple
    colors will allow you to find the right one quickly.'

- en: Bulk cable is the right choice for runs inside walls between your control center
    and the data outlets in other rooms. On the other hand, pre-built cables are better
    for shorter distances, such as between terminal blocks or wall outlets and computers,
    control devices, and other equipment, because they're often made with more durable
    jackets and plugs that have permanent collars. It's possible to build your own
    patch cords out of bulk cable and loose plugs, but attaching plugs to cables is
    tedious work that's generally more trouble than it's worth. As a rule of thumb,
    use bulk cable for permanent installations with a terminal block to each end,
    and pre-built cables for patch cords and for connections between wall outlets
    and network devices.

    they're often four or five times more expensive than the identical cables sold
    through industrial electronics suppliers and online sources such as Jameco ([http://www.jameco.com/](http://www.jameco.com/)),
    Cyberguys ([http://www.cyberguys.com/](http://www.cyberguys.com/)), and [Newegg.com](http://newegg.com)
    ([http://www.newegg.com/](http://www.newegg.com/)). A 3-foot cable should *not*
    cost $8 or $10\. There's no reason to pay more for "premium" patch cables; any
    cable that meets the CAT5e specification will do the job. (This piece of advice
    will probably save you more money than you paid for this book.)

    run your data cables through the plenum space above the ceiling or under the floor.
    However, fire regulations often require special *plenum cable* that won't burn
    easily and won't produce toxic fumes. Plenum cable is more expensive than regular
    bulk Ethernet cable, and it's more difficult to use because the jacket is heavier
    and less flexible, but there's no difference in its data-handling performance.
    When you're shopping for cable, you might find boxes or spools of plenum cable
    next to regular CAT5e cable. Sometimes the only difference is a single line on
    a label. Unless you have a specific need for plenum cable, don't waste your money
    on the more expensive stuff.

    walls from below, drilling upward from an unfinished ceiling in the basement or

    can't get to the inside of the walls from above or below, your best option will
    be to cut holes in the wall and drill through the vertical studs, or to hide cables
    and holes behind mop boards and other moldings. After the wires are in place,

- en: Most video wiring inside a building uses coaxial cable called *RG6/U* with a
    central copper wire surrounded by insulation and a metal shield. The connectors
    that attach to this cable are called *F connectors*.

- en: Video cables usually require a special tool to attach the F connector to each
    end of the cable. If you're not installing your own video distribution system
    along with your data network, and you have to install your own cable from the
    service entry to the network control center, it might be easier and cheaper to
    buy a pre-assembled cable with the connectors already attached (look for a cable
    close to the length you need—don't use a 100-foot cable for a 20-foot run). Use
    electrical tape or a cable tie to hold excess lengths of cable in a neat loop
    at one end.

- en: If you have to install the video cable yourself, find the service entry where
    the cable comes into your house or office. String the cable along the ceiling
    or through the rafters under the floor to the control center, then attach the
    cable to the F connector inside the outlet plate. If there's a splitter with a
    spare connector at the service entry, screw the plug at the end of the cable onto
    the unused socket. If you can't find a splitter, you'll have to install a new
    one, or distribute your video from the control panel.

    cable from the service entry directly into your cable modem. If you want to use
    the control panel to distribute cable TV signals to outlets throughout the house,
    connect the cable from the service entrance to the input of a splitter and connect
    the outputs to your cable modem and the cables from each room.

    *RJ-45* socket (be sure to follow the color codes) and attach a tag to the cable
    that identifies the location of the cable's other end. Use a marking pen or the
    label supplied with the terminal block to identify each cable on the cover of
    the block. Your goal is to be able to figure out at a glance which terminal block
    connects to what destination.

- en: There are two different standard color codes for connecting Ethernet cables
    to plugs and sockets. Use one of the standard color codes (T568A or T568B) to
    connect each wire in the cable to the socket inside the terminal block. [Table 6-2](ch06s04.html#wiring_for_ethernet_cables_and_sockets
    "Table 6-2. Wiring for Ethernet Cables and Sockets") shows the correct connections.
    It doesn't matter which of the two standards you use, as long as both ends of
    each cable follow the same standard. The best approach is to choose a standard
    and wire every socket in your network to that standard.

    helpful to have a telephone next to the control panel, so you can talk to a technical
    support person while you're looking at the status lights on the modem, router,
    or switch. You won't need this phone very often, but when something goes wrong,
    you will be happy to have it. Use a cell phone or a cordless handset if you have
    one, or install an inexpensive wall phone on or near the control panel. If possible,
    look for a simple desk or wall phone that does not require an external power supply.

    a game controller, and an Internet radio to the household network through that
    switch.
