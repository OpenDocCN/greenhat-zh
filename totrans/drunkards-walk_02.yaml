    thousands of twinkling sources of light. Nestled among those haphazardly scattered
    stars are patterns. A lion here, a dipper there. The ability to detect patterns
    can be both a strength and a weakness. Isaac Newton pondered the patterns of falling
    objects and created a law of universal gravitation. Others have noted a spike
    in their athletic performance when they are wearing dirty socks and thenceforth
    have refused to wear clean ones. Among all the patterns of nature, how do we distinguish
    the meaningful ones? Drawing that distinction is an inherently practical enterprise.
    And so it might not astonish you to learn that, unlike geometry, which arose as
    a set of axioms, proofs, and theorems created by a culture of ponderous philosophers,
    the theory of randomness sprang from minds focused on spells and gambling, figures
    we might sooner imagine with dice or a potion in hand than a book or a scroll.'

    fourth decade on the planet. She might have undergone a conversion to a fundamentalist
    religious cult, married a skinhead and had a swastika tattooed on her left buttock,
    or become too busy with other aspects of her life to remain politically active.
    In each of these cases and many others she would probably not be active in the

    and people’s assessments of uncertain events interested Kahneman and Tversky because
    it can lead to unfair or mistaken assessments in real-life situations. Which is
    more likely: that a defendant, after discovering the body, left the scene of the
    crime or that a defendant, after discovering the body, left the scene of the crime

    Whether involved in a criminal case or a civil case, clients typically depend
    on their lawyers to assess what may occur if their case goes to trial. What are
    the chances of acquittal or of a settlement or a monetary judgment in various
    amounts? Although attorneys might not phrase their opinions in terms of numerical
    probabilities, they offer advice based on their personal forecast of the relative
    likelihood of the possible outcomes. Here, too, the researchers found that lawyers
    assign higher probabilities to contingencies that are described in greater detail.
    For example, at the time of the civil lawsuit brought by Paula Jones against then
    president Bill Clinton, 200 practicing lawyers were asked to predict the probability
    that the trial would not run its full course. For some of the subjects that possibility
    was broken down into specific causes for the trial’s early end, such as settlement,
    withdrawal of the charges, or dismissal by the judge. In comparing the two groups—lawyers
    who had simply been asked to predict whether the trial would run its full course
    and lawyers who had been presented with ways in which the trial might reach a
    premature conclusion—the researchers found that the lawyers who had been presented
    with causes of a premature conclusion were much more likely than the other lawyers
    to predict that the trial would reach an early end.

    properties of lines, planes, triangles, and other geometric forms. From this knowledge
    they discerned, for example, that the earth is a sphere and even calculated its

    angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the interior angles on the

    Greeks believed that the future unfolded according to the will of the gods. If
    the result of an astragalus toss meant “marry the stocky Spartan girl who pinned
    you in that wrestling match behind the school barracks,” a Greek boy wouldn’t
    view the toss as the lucky (or unlucky) result of a random process; he would view
    it as the gods’ will. Given such a view, an understanding of randomness would
    have been irrelevant. Thus a mathematical prediction of randomness would have
    seemed impossible. Another answer may lie in the very philosophy that made the
    Greeks such great mathematicians: they insisted on absolute truth, proved by logic
    and axioms, and frowned on uncertain pronouncements. In Plato’s *Phaedo,* for
    example, Simmias tells Socrates that “arguments from probabilities are impostors”
    and anticipates the work of Kahneman and Tversky by pointing out that “unless
    great caution is observed in the use of them they are apt to be deceptive—in geometry,
    and in other things too.”[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts4a) And

    But even Greeks who believed that probabilists were worth an ace might have had

  zh: 为什么希腊人没有发展出概率论的理论？一个答案是许多希腊人相信未来是按照神意展开的。如果一个髌骨投掷的结果意味着“娶那个在学校兵营后面的摔跤比赛中把你压倒的矮胖斯巴达女孩”，一个希腊男孩不会把投掷看作是随机过程的幸运（或不幸运）结果；他会认为这是神的旨意。在这种观点下，对随机性的理解将变得无关紧要。因此，对随机性的数学预测似乎是不可能的。另一个答案可能在于使希腊人成为伟大数学家的哲学：他们坚持绝对真理，通过逻辑和公理来证明，并反对不确定的声明。例如，在柏拉图的《斐多》中，西米阿斯告诉苏格拉底，“基于概率的论证是骗子”，并预见了卡尼曼和特沃斯基的工作，指出“除非在使用它们时非常小心，否则它们很容易具有欺骗性——在几何学和其他事物中。”在《泰阿泰德》中，苏格拉底说，任何“在几何学中从概率和可能性中进行论证的数学家都不值得一枚王牌。”[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts4a)

    brilliant progress among them than mathematics. But we have established as the

    intellectual concepts. Recognizing that evidence and testimony often conflicted
    and that the best way to resolve such conflicts was to quantify the inevitable
    uncertainty, the Romans created the concept of half proof, which applied in cases
    in which there was no compelling reason to believe or disbelieve evidence or testimony.
    In some cases the Roman doctrine of evidence included even finer degrees of proof,
    as in the church decree that “a bishop should not be condemned except with seventy-two
    witnesses…a cardinal priest should not be condemned except with forty-four witnesses,
    a cardinal deacon of the city of Rome without thirty-six witnesses, a subdeacon,

    set of rules based on probability first arose.

    the pictures of those 100 guys you’ve met so far through your Internet dating
    service, those men who in their Web site photos often look like Tom Cruise but
    in person more often resemble Danny DeVito. Suppose also that on the back of each
    card you list certain data about the men, such as honest (yes or no) and attractive
    (yes or no). Finally, suppose that 1 in 10 of the prospective soul mates rates
    a yes in each case. How many in your pack of 100 will pass the test on both counts?
    Let’s take honest as the first trait (we could equally well have taken attractive).
    Since 1 in 10 cards lists a yes under honest, 10 of the 100 cards will qualify.
    Of those 10, how many are attractive? Again, 1 in 10, so now you are left with
    1 card. The first 1 in 10 cuts the possibilities down by ¹/[10], and so does the
    next 1 in 10, making the result 1 in 100\. That’s why you multiply. And if you
    have more requirements than just honest and attractive, you have to keep multiplying,
    so…well, good luck.

    of ^(999,000)/[1,000,000] proof. For instance, it is not uncommon for experts
    in DNA analysis to testify at a criminal trial that a DNA sample taken from a
    crime scene matches that taken from a suspect. How certain are such matches? When
    DNA evidence was first introduced, a number of experts testified that false positives
    are impossible in DNA testing. Today DNA experts regularly testify that the odds
    of a random person’s matching the crime sample are less than 1 in 1 million or
    1 in 1 billion. With those odds one could hardly blame a juror for thinking, *throw
    away the key.* But there is another statistic that is often not presented to the
    jury, one having to do with the fact that labs make errors, for instance, in collecting
    or handling a sample, by accidentally mixing or swapping samples, or by misinterpreting
    or incorrectly reporting results. Each of these errors is rare but not nearly
    as rare as a random match. The Philadelphia City Crime Laboratory, for instance,
    admitted that it had swapped the reference sample of the defendant and the victim
    in a rape case, and a testing firm called Cellmark Diagnostics admitted a similar
    error.[^(20)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts20a) Unfortunately, the
    power of statistics relating to DNA presented in court is such that in Oklahoma
    a court sentenced a man named Timothy Durham to more than 3,100 years in prison
    even though eleven witnesses had placed him in another state at the time of the
    crime. It turned out that in the initial analysis the lab had failed to completely
    separate the DNA of the rapist and that of the victim in the fluid they tested,
    and the combination of the victim’s and the rapist’s DNA produced a positive result
    when compared with Durham’s. A later retest turned up the error, and Durham was
    released after spending nearly four years in prison.[^(21)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts21a)

    times smaller than the former, to a very good approximation the chance of both
    errors is the same as the chance of the more probable error—that is, the chances

    this increased importance has not come increased understanding on the part of
    attorneys, judges, or juries. As explained by Thomas Lyon, who teaches probability
    and the law at the University of Southern California, “Few students take a probability
    in law course, and few attorneys feel it has a place.”[^(23)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts23a)
    In law as in other realms, the understanding of randomness can reveal hidden layers
    of truth, but only to those who possess the tools to uncover them. In the next
    chapter we shall consider the story of the first man to study those tools systematically.

  zh: 现代法庭中使用概率和统计学仍然是一个有争议的话题。在柯林斯案中，加利福尼亚最高法院贬低了其所称的“数学审判”，但它为更多“数学技术的适当应用”留下了空间。在随后的几年里，法院很少考虑数学论证，但即使律师和法官没有引用明确的概率或数学定理，他们仍然经常使用这种推理，陪审员在权衡证据时也是如此。此外，由于评估DNA证据的必要性，统计论证变得越来越重要。不幸的是，随着这种重要性的增加，律师、法官或陪审团的理解并没有相应增加。正如南加州大学的概率与法律教授托马斯·莱昂解释的那样，“很少有学生选修法律课程中的概率课程，也很少有律师觉得它有存在的必要。”[^(23)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c02-nts23a)
    在法律和其他领域一样，对随机性的理解可以揭示隐藏的真相层面，但只有那些拥有揭示这些真相工具的人才能做到。在下一章中，我们将考虑第一个系统地研究这些工具的人的故事。
