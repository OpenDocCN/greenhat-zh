- en: Because Linux owes much of its growth and development to the Internet, it should
    come as no surprise that there is a wealth of information about the various flavors
    of Linux, including Ubuntu, available to you online. In addition to the usual
    news, how-to, and download sites, you will also find a variety of tutorials, forums,
    blogs, and other sources of useful information—all of which you can turn to as
    you use and learn more about your system.

- en: When you are looking for advice, trying to solve a particular problem, or just
    looking for some general tips, online forums are the way to go. Fortunately, Ubuntu
    has a forum all its own, and since Ubuntu is primarily a desktop-oriented Linux
    distro, you are likely to find many fellow newbies and newbie-friendly posters
    there, rather than the hard-core geekiness you might find on some other sites.
    There are, of course, other newbie-friendly forums, which, although not Ubuntu-specific,
    should also be able to provide you with lots of helpful information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of which forum you are posting in, just be sure to mention that you
    are using Ubuntu, which version you have (Lucid Lynx, in case you forgot), and
    that you are new to Linux. And remember to always seek clarification when you
    get an answer you don't understand. The same poster will usually come back and
    clarify things for you. You should feel right at home at most of these sites,
    though you will probably come to like one or two more than the others.
