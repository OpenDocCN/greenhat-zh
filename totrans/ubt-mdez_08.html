In this era of graphical interfaces, the idea of typing commands to get things done seems like a dreadful throwback to the days of DOS, and that puts many people off, especially those who remember the “old days.”<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0001"/></p><p>This reaction is fair enough, but it is not an accurate reflection of the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some sort of graphical interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they hope to achieve through drop-down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many are able to survive quite happily without ever once opening their Terminal. The same could be true of you.</p><p>Be that as it may, there is still much to be said for the power and convenience of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be utilized within a graphical environment also makes it much less forbidding. The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of graphical bodies (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#putting_the_terminal_into_perspective" title="Figure 8-1. Putting the Terminal into perspective">Figure 8-1</a>). Using the command line can be as pain-free as anything else you do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a little fun if you are willing to give it a try.</p><div class="figure"><a id="putting_the_terminal_into_perspective"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e7762"/><img alt="Putting the Terminal into perspective" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263624.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-1. Putting the Terminal into perspective</p></div><p>Unfortunately, many guides to using the command line are written by hard-core command-line junkies, whose enthusiasm for what they see as a really good thing inadvertently makes what they write seem even more off-putting to the recent Linux immigrant or wannabe.</p><p>For your sake, I will try not to gush with enthusiasm so as not to scare you right back to <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a> and the more comfortable world of the Ubuntu Software Center. I will also try to help you keep things in perspective by teaching you, whenever possible, to use the command line as a complement or alternative to the various graphical tools that you have at your disposal, rather than presenting it as the sole way of going about things. Of course, I am not going to cover every possible angle in this regard—just enough to give you some exposure and experience and, ideally, make you feel at least a little more at ease with the command line. Who knows? You might actually come to think of using the command line as . . . fun? Well, I won’t get too carried away.</p><div class="sect1" title="Meet the Terminal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="meet_the_terminal"/>Meet the Terminal</h1></div></div></div><p>You can run the Linux command-line Terminal application in your Ubuntu system by going to the Dash, typing <strong class="userinput"><code>terminal</code></strong>, and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. When the Terminal opens, it will, in all its simplicity, look much like <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#the_terminal_application" title="Figure 8-2. The Terminal application">Figure 8-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_terminal_application"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e7789"/><img alt="The Terminal application" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263626.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-2. The Terminal application</p></div><p>As you can see, all it says is <code class="literal">rg@mydesktop:˜$</code>. In this case, <code class="literal">rg</code> is my username, <code class="literal">mydesktop</code> is the name I gave my computer during installation, and the tilde (<code class="literal">˜</code>) signifies that I am in my Home folder. If it were to say <code class="literal">˜/Music</code>, for example, it would mean that I am currently in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder within my Home folder. Of course, all this will be different in your case, because your username and computer name will be different. If your username is <span class="emphasis"><em>frog</em></span> and your computer’s name is <span class="emphasis"><em>wetrock</em></span>, for example, the command line will say <code class="literal">frog@wetrock:˜$</code>. If all this is sounding rather obtuse to you, just think of it this way: <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em><code class="literal">@</code><span class="strong"><strong>computer_name</strong></span><code class="literal">:˜$</code> in the Terminal is the equivalent of your Home folder in Nautilus.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0002"/></p><p>Typing in the Terminal is straightforward enough; you just type as you usually do. You can also delete and insert letters or phrases by using the delet<span class="keycap">e</span> and <span class="keycap">backspace</span> keys and the arrow keys. For practice, try the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>I like strawberries so very much</code></strong>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change <code class="literal">strawberries</code> to <code class="literal">cherries</code>. (You’ve changed your mind!) Start by using your left arrow key to move the cursor in front of the first s in <code class="literal">strawberries</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tap your <span class="keycap">delete</span> key as many times as necessary to erase the word <code class="literal">strawberries</code> (that would be 12 times, methinks).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>cherries</code></strong> and then use your right arrow key to move the cursor back to the end of this meaningful sentence.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now that you’ve completed this fascinating bit of typing practice, press the <span class="keycap">enter</span> key. As you will almost immediately see, the Terminal’s response to your efforts thus far is merely a dismissive <code class="literal">I: command not found</code>. Although you’ve typed a string of text that has meaning to you, it means absolutely nothing to your system. In fact, the system was so shortsighted that it could see nothing other than the first word you typed in the Terminal (<code class="literal">I</code>), and because <code class="literal">I</code> is not a valid command, the system had no idea what do to with it.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Some Goofy yet Useful Fun with the Command Terminal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="some_goofy_yet_useful_fun_with_the_comma"/>Some Goofy yet Useful Fun with the Command Terminal</h1></div></div></div><p>A rather cool thing about typing in the command Terminal is that it has what you might call <span class="emphasis"><em>short-term memory</em></span>. Try it by typing the word <strong class="userinput"><code>cherry</code></strong> and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Ignoring the command-not-found message, go on and type <strong class="userinput"><code>vanilla</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Now type <strong class="userinput"><code>gelato</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. So far, so dumb, right? Well, not really. Let’s type everything we’ve typed thus far again, but this time let’s do it with only one key.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0004"/></p><p>Huh?</p><p>Yes, just press the up arrow key once, and what do you see? That’s right—the last command you typed appears, which in this case would be gelato. Press the up arrow key again, and the command that you typed before that will appear—<code class="literal">vanilla</code>. One more time? Yes, <code class="literal">cherry</code>. And one more time for the grand finale . . . <code class="literal">I like cherries so very much</code>.</p><p>Considering what we have thus far, this may all seem a bit silly, but imagine that you’re not typing goofy little words and instead have to deal with considerably longer strings, such as a simple copy command (which you’ll learn about later in this chapter) like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e7945"/><pre class="programlisting">cp Photos/mypics/stpierre/coastal/onthebeach1_27.jpg /home/frog/photos_for_mom/stpierre</pre><p>By typing that string, you are copying an image called <span class="emphasis"><em>onthebeach1_27.jpg</em></span> from the <span class="emphasis"><em>coastal</em></span> folder to another folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>stpierre</em></span>. If you wanted to copy another photo in the <span class="emphasis"><em>coastal</em></span> folder, <span class="emphasis"><em>onthebeach1_16.jpg</em></span>, for instance, you could simply press the up arrow key once, use the left arrow key and <span class="keycap">delete</span> key to move over to and delete the <code class="literal">27</code>, and replace it with <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong>. All in all, it would be much simpler and much faster. It would also help you avoid mistakes in typing. Not so dumb anymore, eh?</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Nontoxic Commands"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="nontoxic_commands"/>Nontoxic Commands</h1></div></div></div><p>As you now know, all of this typing is easy enough, but to actually do something useful with your Terminal, you need to type commands—and there are more of them than you could ever hope or need to know. To get you started, we will begin with some commands that are easy to understand, nontoxic, and completely kitten friendly.</p><div class="sect2" title="$ whoami"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_whoami"/>$ whoami</h2></div></div></div><p>There is no command as easy, safe, or even as seemingly useless as <code class="literal">whoami</code>. Rather than help those with multiple personality disorders discover who they are at any given moment, the <code class="literal">whoami</code> command simply tells you which user is currently logged in. Try it by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>whoami</code></strong> after the <code class="literal">$</code> and then pressing the <span class="keycap">enter</span> key. Remember that commands are case sensitive.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0005"/></p><p>The Terminal will now tell you the username of the person currently logged in. If you are logged in as <span class="emphasis"><em>frog</em></span>, you should get <code class="literal">frog</code> as the answer to your command.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ pwd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_pwd"/>$ pwd</h2></div></div></div><p>If you know who you are but aren’t exactly sure where you are, <code class="literal">pwd</code> (print working directory) should come in handy. The <code class="literal">pwd</code> command tells you exactly where the Terminal is in your directory tree.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0012"/></p><p>Let’s say, for example, that my Terminal is in my personal home directory (which is called <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>) in the system’s home directory (which is called <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span> and which is where all the user account directories are located). When I use the <code class="literal">pwd</code> command, I would get <code class="literal">/home/rg</code> printed to my Terminal. You should get similar results if you try it.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The word <span class="emphasis"><em>print</em></span>, in this case, has nothing to do with your printer; it merely means that the response will be printed to, or displayed in, the Terminal.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="$ df"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_df"/>$ df</h2></div></div></div><p>Another safe and easy, but much more useful, command is <code class="literal">df</code> (disk filesystem). The <code class="literal">df</code> command tells you how much disk space you have used, as well as how much space you still have available, on each of the partitions on your various mounted disks. Try it by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>df</code></strong> and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Your output should look something like that shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#output_from_the_df_command" title="Figure 8-3. Output from the df command">Figure 8-3</a> (depending, of course, on the size of your mounted disks and how they are set up.)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0013"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_df_command"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e8104"/><img alt="Output from the df command" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263628.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-3. Output from the <code class="literal">df</code> command</p></div><p>As you will notice, the sizes are given in kilobytes (KB) rather than the gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB) you are probably more used to, but there is a way around this. Many commands accept a <span class="emphasis"><em>flag</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>option</em></span>, to further fine-tune how the command performs. You type flags directly after the main command and precede them with a space and a hyphen.</p><p>In this case, you can try using the -h (human readable) flag to have your figures come out in the way you are most familiar with. Try this by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>df -h</code></strong> on the command line and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The output should now appear in a more familiar format (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#output_from_the_df_command_with_the_-h_f" title="Figure 8-4. Output from the df command with the -h flag">Figure 8-4</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_df_command_with_the_-h_f"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e8136"/><img alt="Output from the df command with the -h flag" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263630.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-4. Output from the <code class="literal">df</code> command with the <code class="literal">-h</code> flag</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="$ ls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_ls"/>$ ls</h2></div></div></div><p>Another harmless but handy command is <code class="literal">ls</code> (list directory contents). The <code class="literal">ls</code> command shows you what is in your current directory. This is the nongraphical equivalent of double-clicking a folder in Nautilus to see what is inside. Try it by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>ls</code></strong> and then pressing the <span class="keycap">enter</span> key.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0022"/></p><p>If you’ve been following <span class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> commands so far, your results should list all of the folders in your home directory. You can also use the <code class="literal">-R</code> flag to show not only the list of files in the folder but also what is within the subfolders. Of course, you might not have created any subfolders yet, so you can hold off experimenting with this for a while. Instead, try typing <strong class="userinput"><code>ls -a</code></strong> to see your invisible, or <span class="emphasis"><em>hidden</em></span>, files.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ calendar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_calendar"/>$ calendar</h2></div></div></div><p>I’ll let you experiment with this one on your own.

These commands are also essentially safe and sane if you follow my instructions.</p><div class="sect2" title="$ mkdir"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_mkdir"/>$ mkdir</h2></div></div></div><p>You have already learned how to create folders by means of menus and your mouse, but you can also do this using the command line. The command is <code class="literal">mkdir</code> (make directory), and it is easy as pie to use (though I’ve never been quite sure how pie is easy).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0024"/></p><p>To see how this command works and to work with the commands that follow, use the <code class="literal">mkdir</code> command now to create a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>command_exp</em></span> (for command experiments). All you have to do is type <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir command_exp</code></strong> in a new Terminal window and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The new folder should appear in your Home folder, so go ahead and check to see whether it is there by clicking the home icon on your desktop.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0032"/></p><p>Okay, good, <span class="emphasis"><em>bra</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>bueno</em></span>! Now let’s create another new folder within that new folder—a <span class="emphasis"><em>subfolder</em></span>, if you will. We’ll call this one <span class="emphasis"><em>sub</em></span>. So, just type <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir command_exp/sub</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. If you like, take a peek and see whether the <span class="emphasis"><em>sub</em></span> folder has appeared within the <span class="emphasis"><em>command_exp</em></span> folder.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ mv"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_mv"/>$ mv</h2></div></div></div><p>The next command is the <code class="literal">mv</code> (move) command, but before you experiment with it, you need to create a dummy file—you need something to move, after all. You can do this by using another command—<code class="literal">touch</code>. To make the file—let’s call it <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span>—go to the Terminal, type <strong class="userinput"><code>touch expfile.txt</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The new file will appear in your Home folder.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0034"/></p><p>To move the file that you’ve just created, you will use the <code class="literal">mv</code> command, of course. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>mv expfile.txt command_exp/sub</code></strong> (this tells the system which file to move and where to move it to) and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The file will now be in your <span class="emphasis"><em>sub</em></span> folder.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ cd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_cd"/>$ cd</h2></div></div></div><p>Until now, you have been using the command line from your Home folder. With the <code class="literal">cd</code> command, you can change your Terminal’s location to another folder. You’ll be using this very handy command quite a lot when doing the projects in this book. To take it out for a spin, let’s get inside the <span class="emphasis"><em>command_exp</em></span> folder by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>cd command_exp</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. If you’ve done this correctly, the prompt in your Terminal will now read <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em><code class="literal">@</code><em class="replaceable"><code>computer_name</code></em><code class="literal">:˜/command_exp$</code>. If so, you can pat yourself on the back.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0035"/></p><p>While you are there, you might as well try the <code class="literal">ls</code> command with the <code class="literal">R</code> (recursive) flag to see how that works. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>ls -R</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Your Terminal should show that you have a subfolder here called <span class="emphasis"><em>sub</em></span> and a file inside that subfolder called <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span>.</p><p>That is all you really want to do in there for now, so to get back to your home directory, just type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, which will take you back home, so to speak.</p><p>For future reference, it is worth noting a couple of other <code class="literal">cd</code> command shortcuts. If you are within a subfolder of a subfolder and want to move back a step (from <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg/peas/pudding</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg/peas</em></span>, for example), you can do so by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>cd ..</code></strong> (with a space between <code class="literal">cd</code> and <code class="literal">..</code>) and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. You can also type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd -</code></strong> (with a space between <code class="literal">cd</code> and <code class="literal">-</code>) in order to get back to the directory where you were previously (from <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg/peas/pudding</em></span>, for example).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ cp"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_cp"/>$ cp</h2></div></div></div><p>You might decide that not only do you want your <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span> file in the subfolder but you also want a copy in your home directory, where it was in the first place. To copy <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span>, you can use the <code class="literal">cp</code> (copy) command.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0039"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0040"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0041"/></p><p>The command needs to know where the file you want to copy is, what it is called, and where you want to copy it, which in this case is to your Home folder. Normally you would type <code class="literal">cp command_exp/sub/expfile.txt /home/</code><em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> to do this, but if you recall, you can abbreviate the <code class="literal">/home/</code><em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> portion of the command string to <code class="literal">˜/</code>, which means the same thing. (This is an important tip to remember, because the tilde is frequently used in online instructions.) Because reducing wear and tear on the fingers is always a desirable goal, type the following command and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0043"/></p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e8560"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>cp command_exp/sub/expfile.txt ˜/</code></strong></pre><p>Be sure to put a space between the name of the file you are copying and its destination (in this case, between <code class="literal">expfile.txt</code> and <code class="literal">˜/</code>).</p><p>Once you’ve done this, you should have two copies of <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span>, one in your Home folder and one in your <span class="emphasis"><em>sub</em></span> folder.

You will now embark on a similar move. The first tool in this nostalgic endeavor is the <code class="literal">rm</code> (remove) command, with which you can trash files.</p><p>The <code class="literal">rm</code> command, albeit very useful and easy to use, should be handled with caution. Once you remove a file with this command, there is no going back. The file will not be placed in the Trash—it is gone for good.</p><p>To play it safe, let’s try the rm command by getting rid of that new copy of <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span> that we just created in the Home folder. The basic <code class="literal">rm</code> command structure consists of the command itself, <code class="literal">rm</code>, followed by the name of the file you want to remove. In this case, you want to remove the file called <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span> located in your Home folder. Assuming your Terminal shows you to be home, remove the file by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>rm expfile.txt</code></strong> followed by a tap on the ol’ <span class="keycap">enter</span> key. The file will then be gone, and gone for good.</p><p>Now, double your pleasure by getting rid of the version of <span class="emphasis"><em>expfile.txt</em></span> that is located in the subfolder sub. In this case, you need to specify where the file is because it isn’t in the folder that the Terminal is in. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>rm command_exp/sub/expfile.txt</code></strong> and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Oooh, very cool.

This is without a doubt an easy way to go about such things, but sometimes it may be easier to use the command-line approach.</p><p>The command for changing file permissions is <code class="literal">chmod</code> (change mode). To use it, just type the command followed by the permissions you want to extend to a file and then the location of the file itself. For example, let’s say you copied a JPEG file, <span class="emphasis"><em>mybirthday.jpg</em></span>, from a CD to the <span class="emphasis"><em>personal</em></span> subfolder within the <span class="emphasis"><em>Photos</em></span> folder on your hard disk and the file is write protected. To change the file so that you have write permissions (meaning that you can alter the file), you would type the following and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e8758"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>chmod 644 ˜/photos/personal/mybirthday.jpg</code></strong></pre><p>To change the permissions of all the files and subfolders (and all the files within those subfolders) in one fell swoop, you can add the <code class="literal">-R</code> (recursive) flag to the <code class="literal">chmod</code> command. The command would thus be as follows:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e8769"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>chmod -R 744 ˜/photos/personal</code></strong></pre><p>The number <code class="literal">744</code>, by the way, extends read and write and execute (run) permissions to you, the owner, but gives read-only rights to everyone else. This is a pretty safe choice when in doubt. If you want to figure out permission numbers for yourself, it’s pretty easy. You are basically dealing with three number positions, each of which has eight numerical possibilities (<code class="literal">0</code>-<code class="literal">7</code>). The left slot represents permissions for the owner, the center slot represents permissions for the group, and the third slot represents permissions for others. The meanings of the numbers themselves are as follows:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">7</code></span></dt><dd><p>Read, write, and execute permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">6</code></span></dt><dd><p>Read and write permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">5</code></span></dt><dd><p>Read and execute permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">4</code></span></dt><dd><p>Read-only permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">3</code></span></dt><dd><p>Write and execute permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">2</code></span></dt><dd><p>Write-only permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">1</code></span></dt><dd><p>Execute-only permissions</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">0</code></span></dt><dd><p>No permissions</p></dd></dl></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch08.html#the_meaning_of_permission_numbers" title="Figure 8-5. The meaning of permission numbers">Figure 8-5</a> points out the meaning of each of these numbers and what each number slot represents. In fact, if you don’t mind a bit of simple addition, things are even easier to understand. To start with, remember that 1 = execute, 2 = write, and 4 = read. Add any of those numbers together, and you get the other permission combos. For example, 1 (execute) + 4 (read) = 5 (read and execute). As you can see, permissions aren’t all that complicated.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0056"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0057"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_meaning_of_permission_numbers"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e8858"/><img alt="The meaning of permission numbers" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263632.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-5. The meaning of permission numbers</p></div><p>Now if you’re more of a letters than numbers sort of person, you’ll be happy to know that there is another way to change permissions that is probably even easier. With this approach, you only have to deal with two groups of letters and the symbols <code class="literal">+</code> and <code class="literal">−</code>.</p><p>The first group consists of the following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">u</code></span></dt><dd><p>User (owner of the file)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">g</code></span></dt><dd><p>Group (specified group of users)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">o</code></span></dt><dd><p>Others (anyone who is not the user or a member of the group)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">a</code></span></dt><dd><p>All (all of the above)</p></dd></dl></div><p>The second group consists of the following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">r</code></span></dt><dd><p>Read</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">w</code></span></dt><dd><p>Write</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">x</code></span></dt><dd><p>Execute</p></dd></dl></div><p>You might already be able to figure out how this is all going to work, but I’ll spell it out just in case your intuition is worn out for the day. Let’s say you want to change the permissions of a file (<span class="emphasis"><em>butterhaters.txt</em></span>, for example) so that all users on your machine can read and write to it. After opening a Terminal window, you can make the change by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>chmod a+rw butterhaters.txt</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p><p>Oops! Just remembered that you don’t want anyone changing the content of the file, eh? Well, to take back the write permissions for that file, you just need to type <strong class="userinput"><code>chmod a-w butterhaters.txt</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. As you can see, the <code class="literal">+</code> gives permissions, while the <code class="literal">−</code> taketh away.</p><p>That’s much simpler, you’ve got to admit.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ sudo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_sudo"/>$ sudo</h2></div></div></div><p>When you tried to install software from the Ubuntu Software Center in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a>, you were asked to input your password. The reason for this, as I mentioned then, is that the Ubuntu Software Center installs the files it downloads in various folders throughout your system, almost all of which are write protected. By supplying your password, you are telling your system that you, as holder of the password, have the right to allow the Ubuntu Software Center to do that.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0058"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0059"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0060"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0061"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0062"/></p><p>The command-line version of that same password-giving process is the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command. To perform an operation in a folder that is write protected, you would first type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo</code></strong> and then the command you want to perform. For example, if you wanted to copy an icon image—let’s call it <span class="emphasis"><em>myicon.png</em></span>—to the globally located and write-protected <span class="emphasis"><em>pixmaps</em></span> folder (<span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/share/pixmaps</em></span>), you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo cp myicon.png /usr/share/pixmaps</code></strong>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0064"/></p><p>After typing a command preceded by the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>, you will be prompted for your password. Once you type your password and press <span class="keycap">enter</span> again, the command will be executed. I should mention that once you input your password, it will stay in memory for about five minutes, so you won’t be prompted for your password again when using the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command within that time frame.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ locate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_locate"/>$ locate</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you are familiar with the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command, let’s take it out for a spin by working with the <code class="literal">locate</code> command. The <code class="literal">locate</code> command is essentially a command-line alternative to the graphical Search tool found in the Places menu. Using the command is quite easy: Simply type the command followed by a space and the name of the file you want to find.</p><p>Before you can use this command, though, you should update the database of filenames that <code class="literal">locate</code> uses. This is where using the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command, along with yet another command, <code class="literal">updatedb</code>, comes into play. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo updatedb</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Type your password when asked to do so—and then it will seem as though nothing is happening. But don’t worry. As long as the cursor in your Terminal is blinking, progress is being made, and when your user prompt returns, you will have successfully created the database file. After that, you can use the <code class="literal">locate</code> command.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0065"/></p><p>Oh, and in the future if you think that the process seems to be taking longer and longer, don’t worry—it is. The more files and applications you add to your system, the longer it will take your system to catalog them all.</p><p>To take this new command for a test drive, let’s look for the LibreOffice Writer icon, <span class="emphasis"><em>libreoffice-writer.png</em></span>.

As I mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a>, you can run only one APT tool at a time. Once the coast is clear, you should always start out any operations involving <code class="literal">apt-get</code> with an update of the APT database so that you will be downloading the newest stuff. To do this, just type the command <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo apt-get update</code></strong>.</p><p>If you want to install a single package without heading over to the Ubuntu Software Center, you can do so by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo apt-get install</code></strong> <strong class="userinput"><code><em class="replaceable"><code>package-name</code></em></code></strong>. For example, if you want to download and install the Shufflepuck game clone, Tuxpuck, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo apt-get install tuxpuck</code></strong>.

Finally, the <code class="literal">f</code> tells the program that what follows is the <span class="emphasis"><em>file information</em></span>.</p><p>If, after creating the archive, you suddenly remember that there is one more file you want to add to the mix, you can use the <code class="literal">-r</code> flag to append the archive.</p><p>For example, to add a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>cranky.png</em></span> to the archive, you would type the following and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e9531"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>tar -rvf pics4pals.tar cranky.png</code></strong></pre><p>Of course, chances are that you will be doing more tarball extracting than creating, so you no doubt want to know how to do that. Fortunately, the process is pretty similar to what you do when creating the tarball. The main difference is in the first flag. Rather than using the <code class="literal">tar</code> command with the <code class="literal">-c</code> flag, you would use it with the <code class="literal">-x</code> flag, which tells the tar program to <span class="emphasis"><em>extract</em></span> the specified archive. So if you want to extract a tarball called <span class="emphasis"><em>spicyfood.tar</em></span>, type the following command and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e9555"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>tar -xvf spicyfood.tar</code></strong></pre><p>What you have been doing thus far is creating and extracting archives, which are basically just collections of files. They are not, however, compressed. In fact, most tarballs you find will be compressed, and you can tell by the ending <span class="emphasis"><em>tar.gz</em></span>. That <span class="emphasis"><em>gz</em></span> means that the archive was compressed using the gzip program. Extracting a compressed tarball is just as easy as extracting a straight tar archive; all you have to do is add the <code class="literal">-z</code> flag, which tells your system to use the gzip program to decompress the archive. For example, if you want to extract a compressed tarball called <span class="emphasis"><em>goosedown.tar.gz</em></span>, type the following command and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e9576"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>tar -xzvf goosedown.tar.gz</code></strong></pre><p>Well, now that you know how to decompress and extract a gzipped tarball, you probably want to know how to create one. This is, again, little different than creating the tar archive itself; you would just add the <code class="literal">-z</code> tag to tell the program to use gzip to compress the folder. For example, to create a compressed version of your <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder, which we’ll call <span class="emphasis"><em>tightpics.tar.gz</em></span>, you would type the following and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting8_d1e9593"/><pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>tar -czvf tightpics.tar.gz Pictures</code></strong></pre><p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that you may also come across some files compressed with the bzip program. Such files are recognizable by some variation on the <span class="emphasis"><em>.bz</em></span> or .<span class="emphasis"><em>bz2</em></span> file extension. Dealing with these files should pose no problem, because the commands are almost identical to those for gzip. Just substitute <code class="literal">-j</code> for <code class="literal">-z</code> in the command string.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0093"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0094"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0095"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0096"/></p><div class="sect3" title="Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="compressing_and_extracting_compressed_si"/>Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files</h3></div></div></div><p>If you want to compress or decompress a single file, you don’t really need to use the tar program at all, since its purpose is to create archives consisting of several files. You can instead use the <code class="literal">gzip</code> and <code class="literal">gunzip</code> commands directly. For example, to compress a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg</em></span>, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gzip matilda.jpg</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg</em></span> file would then become <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg.gz</em></span>. To decompress the file, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gunzip matilda.jpg.gz</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, after which the <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg</em></span> file would be back to normal.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0097"/></p><p>So, can you compress an archive you’ve already created with the <code class="literal">tar</code> command? Sure. For example, to compress the spicyfood.tar archive mentioned earlier, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gzip spicyfood.tar</code></strong>, and voilá—you’ve got yourself a compressed <span class="emphasis"><em>spicyfood.tar.gz</em></span> archive.

You may not need such a <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file, but it’s an easy enough way to work a bit more with commands and the Terminal itself, so let’s give it a try.</p><p>To start out, you will open the Terminal-based Nano editor to create the <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file.

Usually this isn’t necessary because the contents of most tarballs are already packaged in a folder of their own. By double-clicking the tarball to open it in File Roller, you can see whether things are packed in a folder or simply as a group of files. In the case of pyWings, it is the latter, so follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Create a <span class="emphasis"><em>pywings</em></span> folder by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir pywings</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Move the pyWings tarball into that folder by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>mv Downloads/pywings*.gz pywings</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0105"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0106"/></p><p>You can see that in this step you used an asterisk (<code class="literal">*</code>) to save some wear and tear on your fingers.

However, it’s a pain to open your Terminal and type that somewhat lengthy string every time you want to find out what fate has in store for you. Let’s find a way to make things easier in the future.</p><p>To run an application from the Terminal, you generally type the name of that application or, to put it more precisely, the name of that program’s executable file; the application’s name thus acts as a sort of command. For your system to recognize that command, however, the command (the executable file or a link to it) must be in a location where the system can find it. Whenever you run a command of any sort, your system checks a series of locations (most of which are <span class="emphasis"><em>bin folders</em></span>, where executable files are located) to find that command.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0107"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0108"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0109"/></p><p>You can easily find out where these locations are by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>echo $PATH</code></strong> in a new Terminal window and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>. As you will see, on your Ubuntu system, these locations are as follows:</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/sbin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/bin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/sbin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/bin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/sbin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/bin</em></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/games</em></span></td></tr></table><p>The results of the <code class="literal">echo $PATH</code> command will not appear as they do in the (easier to read) chart shown here but, rather, in a single line divided by colons. The actual output shown in the Terminal is <code class="literal">/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games</code>.</p><p>If the command you typed is in one of those locations, the program or script will run. As you no doubt know, however, pyWings is not in any of those locations. It is in <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/</em></span>username<span class="emphasis"><em>/LocalApps/pyWings</em></span> and is thus, in a sense, out of your system’s sight.</p><p>To remedy this situation, you could add the path of your pyWings script to the list of paths that the system checks for run commands so as to make the system aware of your new application’s existence. However, let’s try another method that I think is easier. What you will do is create a link to pyWings, a sort of launchable alias, in one of the locations your system does check for commands.</p><p>To create this link, you will use three commands: cd (to change directories), <code class="literal">sudo</code> (to give yourself write access to the destination folder), and <code class="literal">ln -s</code> (to create the link).</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In the Terminal, type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd /usr/games</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.

(Note that there is a space between the terms <code class="literal">pywings.py</code> and <code class="literal">pywings</code> at the end of that command string.)</p><p>The <code class="literal">pywings</code> at the end of that command string is the name that you are giving the link; the name of the link thus becomes the command you will use to run the application. If you type nothing, the link will be called <span class="emphasis"><em>pywings.py</em></span>, which would mean three more keystrokes for you every time you wanted to start the program.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type your password when prompted to do so and then press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Now make your new launcher executable by changing its permissions: Type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo chmod +x pywings</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0110"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span> to return the Terminal to your Home folder.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" title="8B-8: Running pyWings Again"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-8_colon_running_pywings_again"/>8B-8: Running pyWings Again</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have created the link, you should be able to run the pyWings program much more easily. To try it out, quit pyWings (if it is still running), type <strong class="userinput"><code>pywings</code></strong> in the Terminal window, and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. Your personal pyWings oracle should appear again.</p><p>You’ve managed to cut down on the number of keystrokes required to run pyWings from the Terminal. However, if you are really into this pyWings thing and want to use it often, it will probably be handiest to add a launcher to your panel, a drawer, or the Applications menu.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 8C: Command Practice Review with Briscola"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_8c_colon_command_practice_review"/>Project 8C: Command Practice Review with Briscola</h1></div></div></div><p>If you want to reinforce the skills you’ve put to use in the previous project, why not go a bit Continental and try Briscola?

Points are awarded on the basis of the cards involved in that trick. The winner of the trick then goes on to <span class="emphasis"><em>lead</em></span> the next trick, meaning that the winner puts out his or her card first the next time around.

For the beginner, just the mention of compiling a program from source seems off-putting. The words <span class="emphasis"><em>compile</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span> seem to instill a sense of foreboding in the heart of the new user. That certainly was the case for me, anyway.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0124"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0125"/></p><p>You can live long and prosper without ever bothering to compile anything on your system. You can move along quite happily with your system as is, or you can just install programs by means of the much more convenient Ubuntu Software Center. Still, once in the Linux world, you are likely to come across this installation method and may well become curious, especially if you move into the geekier side of the community.</p><div class="sect2" title="What Is Source?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="what_is_source_question"/>What Is Source?</h2></div></div></div><p>To get started, it is probably a good idea to understand what <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span> is so as to understand a bit about how a program actually metamorphoses from its primitive state on the programmer’s computer into an up-and-running application on your machine. First the programmer writes a program in a programming language. You have probably heard of programming languages such as BASIC or C, and there are many others. What the programmer actually writes with such a language is a set of instructions called the <span class="emphasis"><em>source code</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span>. Your computer, however, cannot actually understand any of that source on its own. It is as if the computer speaks ancient Greek and the source code is all written in French.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0126"/></p><p>The various languages that programmers use are called <span class="emphasis"><em>high-level</em></span> languages — they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, on the other hand, understands only <span class="emphasis"><em>low-level languages</em></span>, which are quite difficult for most mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the high-level language instructions into a low-level language, the computer needs some other program to translate. To put it another way, the computer needs an interpreter.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0127"/></p><p>If this translation process takes place while a program is running, the translator program is actually called an <span class="emphasis"><em>interpreter</em></span>. Applications that run using an interpreter are usually called <span class="emphasis"><em>scripts</em></span>. The pyWings and Briscola applications earlier in this chapter are examples of such script applications.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0128"/></p><p>The problem with such scripts is that they can be slower than most of the applications you’re familiar with—the computer must run an interpreter, interpret the source code, and run the application all at the same time. This is like having a French book translated into Greek by a live interpreter; it’s very slow indeed.</p><p>As an alternative, most programs use a compiler instead of an interpreter. A <span class="emphasis"><em>compiler</em></span> translates the high-level source code into low-level <span class="emphasis"><em>machine code</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>object code</em></span>, that the computer can understand before the application is run. Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother with the high-level instructions again; it can merely read the translated version each time it runs the program. This is like having a translated version of a foreign book that you can read any time you want. Because computers can run compiled programs without simultaneously using an interpreter, compiled programs run faster than scripts. Most applications for all operating systems are, therefore, compiled.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0129"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0130"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0131"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0132"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0133"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Basics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_basics"/>The Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>The process of compiling an application from source and then installing it is straightforward—a truly “one, two, three” bit of presto change-o. Basically, after extracting the source code from an archived file (usually in the form of a tarball), you would use the following commands to accomplish the task:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>./configure</code></strong></span></dt><dd><p>To configure a <span class="emphasis"><em>makefile</em></span>, which provides instructions for the <code class="literal">make</code> command<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0134"/></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>make</code></strong></span></dt><dd><p>To translate the source code into object code that the computer can understand</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make install</code></strong></span></dt><dd><p>To give yourself write privileges in protected folders and then install the application</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>make clean</code></strong></span></dt><dd><p>To tidy up the leftovers once the process is complete (to clean up the mess)</p></dd></dl></div><p>I know that sounds like a lot of commands, but as I always say, just doing it is easier than reading it on the page, so fear not.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8D-1: Installing the Tools You Need"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-1_colon_installing_the_tools_you_need"/>8D-1: Installing the Tools You Need</h2></div></div></div><p>Before doing anything else, you have to get your system ready to do what you’re about to ask of it. Because Ubuntu is designed with the average computer user in mind, it does not come with the various applications and libraries you need to compile applications from source. Fortunately, however, everything you need to get the job done is available via the Ubuntu Software Center. To get ready for the work at hand in this chapter (and many other jobs you are likely to do on your own in the future), perform searches for and install the following packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>build-essential</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>libgtk2.0-dev</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="8D-2: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg File"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-2_colon_downloading_and_extracting_the"/>8D-2: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg File</h2></div></div></div><p>To get some hands-on experience with compiling a program from source, you will be working with a game called Xmahjongg, which you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#the_xmahjongg_game" title="Figure 8-15. The Xmahjongg game">Figure 8-15</a>. If you’ve tried the version of Mahjongg that comes with your Ubuntu distribution, you will notice that this one is much easier on your eyes and is a bit more colorful (check out the project site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/">http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/</a> to catch a glimpse of it in its full-color glory).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0135"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0136"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_xmahjongg_game"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e10736"/><img alt="The Xmahjongg game" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263652.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-15. The Xmahjongg game</p></div><p>Xmahjongg is available via the Ubuntu Software Center, so it’s not absolutely necessary to install it in the way you are about to, but doing so provides a perfect opportunity to learn how to compile a program from source. The amount of source code isn’t all that great, so compiling won’t take too much time, and it requires no tinkering.</p><p>To get started, you will have to download the Xmahjongg source code. You can get this from the Xmahjongg project page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/">http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/</a>. Download the tarball <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz</em></span> or a newer version if there is one. Do not download any of the other file types available on that page.</p><p>If you prefer, you can instead download the Xmahjongg tarball by using the <code class="literal">wget</code> command that you learned in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#c-1_colon_getting_briscola" title="8C-1: Getting Briscola">8C-1: Getting Briscola</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#c-1_colon_getting_briscola" title="8C-1: Getting Briscola">8C-1: Getting Briscola</a>.

To make it easier for you to follow along with the directions I’ll be giving you, be sure to place the untarred Xmahjongg folder in your Home folder. Then you will be ready to roll.</p><p>Normally at this point, you would look through the folder to find some instructions for dealing with the package, just as you did earlier in the chapter for Briscola. In most source code packages, this information is included in an INSTALL file, like the one in the <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7</em></span> folder (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#identifying_a_packageas_install_file" title="Figure 8-16. Identifying a package’s INSTALL file">Figure 8-16</a>).

Fortunately, the instructions in most INSTALL files will match the process I am about to describe.</p><p>Of course, it may well happen that you take a look at the contents of the INSTALL file and start wondering what alien tongue it is written in.

Note that because installation takes place in permissions-protected parts of your system, you will need to add <code class="literal">sudo</code> to the command string to give yourself administrative privileges.</p><p>To perform the installation, type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make install</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. You will be prompted for your password. After you type it and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>, the installation process will take place. Once your Terminal brings you back to your user prompt, Xmahjongg will be installed and ready to run from the Terminal. Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>xmahjongg</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8D-5: Cleaning Up and/or Uninstalling Xmahjongg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-5_colon_cleaning_up_and_solidus_or_uni"/>8D-5: Cleaning Up and/or Uninstalling Xmahjongg</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you are done and everything seems to be working as it should, you would normally tidy things up in the Xmahjongg folder by getting rid of any unnecessary files. You can do this via the Terminal by using the cd command to go back into the Xmahjongg folder, typing <strong class="userinput"><code>make clean</code></strong>, and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p><p>If you want to uninstall Xmahjongg, open a Terminal window, go back to the Xmahjongg folder by using the <code class="literal">cd</code> command, type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make uninstall</code></strong>, and finally press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. The routine is essentially the same for any applications installed in this way, though as you might imagine, uninstallation isn’t always as smooth a process as what I’ve just described (and it’s definitely not as easy as it is via the Ubuntu Software Center).</p><p>The main reason for the uninstallation process being less than cooperative is that the <code class="literal">make uninstall</code> routine requires you to have kept the original project folder, which means you have to keep a bit of clutter you normally wouldn’t need to bother with. On top of this, some projects do not provide a <code class="literal">make uninstall</code> routine at all. This means that you have to keep track of where everything has been installed in your system and then remove each item using a series of <code class="literal">sudo rm</code> commands.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0140"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0141"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0142"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0143"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0144"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0145"/></p><p>All that aside, go ahead, have some fun, and put your command-line skills to the test.

Not only can you change the background and text colors in the Terminal, but you can even display one of your favorite photos as a background (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#a_terminal_window_with_customized_backgr" title="Figure 8-17. A Terminal window with customized background and font colors">Figure 8-17</a>) or make the background transparent.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-8-0146"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_terminal_window_with_customized_backgr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e10991"/><img alt="A Terminal window with customized background and font colors" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263656.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-17. A Terminal window with customized background and font colors</p></div><p>To change the Terminal background, right-click anywhere in the Terminal and select <span class="strong"><strong>Profiles</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Profile</strong></span> Preferences. When the Editing Profile window appears, click the tab for the part of the profile you want to edit. For example, to add a background image, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> tab, select <span class="strong"><strong>Background image</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#customizing_the_terminal_window" title="Figure 8-18. Customizing the Terminal window">Figure 8-18</a>), and then navigate to the photo you want to use as your background by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Menu</strong></span> button next to the words Image file and finding the file in the Select Background Image window. Once you’ve found the photo of your choice, click <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>. Depending on the image you use for your background, you may find it rather difficult to see text once your image appears in the Terminal. If so, try moving the slider under the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Shade trans</em></span>parent or image background in the Editing Profile window. If that still doesn’t do the trick, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Colors</strong></span> tab, deselect <span class="strong"><strong>Use colors from system theme</strong></span>, and then try some of the preset Foreground and Background combinations from the menu button next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Built-in schemes</em></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="customizing_the_terminal_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11034"/><img alt="Customizing the Terminal window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263658.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-18. Customizing the Terminal window</p></div><p>If you just want to make the background transparent, go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> tab, select <span class="strong"><strong>Transparent background</strong></span>, and drag the slider to the right.

To do this, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Colors</strong></span> tab, deselect <span class="strong"><strong>Use colors from system theme</strong></span>, and then make the appropriate font color selection.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Tabbed Shell Sessions in the Terminal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tabbed_shell_sessions_in_the_terminal"/>Tabbed Shell Sessions in the Terminal</h1></div></div></div><p>To wrap things up in this chapter, I thought I’d mention one particularly convenient feature of the GNOME Terminal: tabs. Just as you can view multiple web pages in one Firefox web browser window through the use of tabs, tabs in the Terminal application allow you to have more than one shell session running at the same time without having more Terminal windows open (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#running_multiple_shell_sessions_in_tabs" title="Figure 8-19. Running multiple shell sessions in tabs within the Terminal">Figure 8-19</a>). This reduces the amount of desktop clutter and generally makes things easier to deal with. You can open a new Terminal tab by clicking anywhere in the Terminal and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Open Tab</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.</p><div class="figure"><a id="running_multiple_shell_sessions_in_tabs"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e11088"/><img alt="Running multiple shell sessions in tabs within the Terminal" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263660.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-19. Running multiple shell sessions in tabs within the Terminal</p></div></div></div></body></html>
