- en: Many people hate to admit it, but games are a big attraction for almost everyone
    at the helm of a personal computer. Even those who deny being gamers often find
    themselves caught in the act of knocking off a quick round of solitaire between
    work projects. As a Linux user, you will most likely find that one of the most
    common questions users of other operating systems will ask you about Linux is
    “What games does it have?” Well, although there might not be as many games in
    the Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose
    from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.

    of more than 80 solitaire card games, shown in [Figure 17-1](ch17.html#aisleriot
    "Figure 17-1. AisleRiot")), FreeCell Solitaire (a standalone version of one of
    the most popular solitaire games around), Mahjongg (a tile-matching game similar
    to the Xmahjongg game introduced in [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Simple Kitten
    Ways")), Mines (the Linux world’s answer to Minesweeper), and Sudoku (the Japanese
    number puzzle). Many other free games are available via the Ubuntu Software Center

    game designers have traditionally neglected Linux to concentrate on the significantly
    larger Windows market, so up until a couple of years ago, there were few Linux-friendly

    Without hardware acceleration, your computer’s processor has to try to do all
    of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn’t designed),
    so your games end up running at a snail’s pace, if at all. Most modern graphics
    cards have hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is enabled will
    depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find out how good
    3D support is for your graphics card at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/).

    and can normally be inserted by pressing shift and `\` on your keyboard.) If you

    If pixilated blobs are failing to intimidate you, why not try something a little
    smoother in the form of Nexuiz ([Figure 17-7](ch17.html#nexuiz "Figure 17-7. Nexuiz"))?
    In terms of gameplay, Nexuiz feels similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect a
    wide array of weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting
    at opponents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most death
    match-style games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are
    other game modes, like “capture the flag.” There’s also an online multiplayer
    option if you’re finding that the computer-controlled opponents aren’t providing

    is broadly similar to the Command and Conquer series of games. You start off on
    a battleground with a small collection of vehicles, which you must command to
    build a base and defend it from enemies. Once your base is in good shape, you
    can build new units and send them to attack your foes. Your opponents are doing
    the same, however, so battles can turn into subtle tactical affairs, where your
    ability to launch successful attacks must be balanced against the limited availability
    of resources and the constant threat that the enemy will destroy your base.

    It’s only recently started accepting paid-for titles into its listings, but the
    number of commercial games that you can obtain through its familiar interface
    is growing all the time. To see what’s on offer, fire up the Software Center and
    click the small downward-facing arrow immediately to the right of the All Software
    button. From the menu that pops up, select **For Purchase**; then browse through
    the list that appears in the main pane of the Software Center window. As I write
    this, most of the software in the list consists of games (though other types of
    commercial software are available here too), with the majority priced from $5
    to $20\. For example, the award-winning puzzle game World of Goo, which sets you
    the challenging task of building wobbly structures out of blobs of black gloop,
    comes in at a pretty reasonable $19.95 (a demo version is available as a DEB package
    if you’d like to try before you buy; check out [http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo](http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo)).
    Another top-notch puzzler is Braid (a bit cheaper at $10), in which you must solve
    puzzles by modifying the flow of time itself. As you saw in [Chapter 6](ch06.html
    "Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird"), installing commercial software is very similar
    to installing anything else from the Software Center, except for an additional
    payment step. See [6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software](ch06.html#a-4_colon_commercial_vs._free_software
    "6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software") in [6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software](ch06.html#a-4_colon_commercial_vs._free_software
    "6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software") to get the full story.'

    how you can also run Windows games in Ubuntu using Wine. Indeed, this is how many
    people enjoy big commercial titles that don’t have Linux versions: Guild Wars,
    Spore, and Call of Duty are just a few examples of games that can be run flawlessly
    in this way. If this sounds like your sort of thing, [Project 19C: Running Windows
    Programs](ch19.html#project_19c_colon_running_windows_progra "Project 19C: Running
    Windows Programs") in [Project 19C: Running Windows Programs](ch19.html#project_19c_colon_running_windows_progra
    "Project 19C: Running Windows Programs") will be of particular interest to you;
    there you’ll learn how to use a neat little app called PlayOnLinux, which can
    be used to handle most of the fiddly configuration stuff that is often required
    to get less well-supported games running under Wine.'

    Ubuntu Software Center is a great one-stop shop for most Linux games. As you have
    also learned, however, there are also many games beyond those in the Ubuntu Software
    Center. These include the games you worked with in [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Simple
    Kitten Ways") that were written in scripting languages, such as the Python-based
    pyWings and the Tcl/Tk-based Briscola, but it just wouldn’t be right to leave
    out games written in what might be considered the mother of all scripting languages—Java.
    In this project, you’ll learn how to install the Java Runtime Environment and
    how to install and run the Java-based version of a classic Austrian card game,
    Schnapsen.

    Java Runtime Environment. If you opted to install third-party software during
    the installation of your system, you already have the Java Runtime Environment
    installed, so you can skip this part of the project and go on to 17B-2\. If not,
    then you can download it now via the Ubuntu Software Center. Just search for and
    install *openjdk java 6 runtime*. The whole set of Java packages is pretty hefty
    in terms of download weight, so don’t get freaked out if this download takes longer
    than usual. When the process is complete, close the Ubuntu Software Center and
    move on to the next step.
