- en: Despite the rapidly growing popularity of Linux, it’s still very much a Windows
    world. If you’re anything like me, you’ll often find yourself working with people
    who use Windows, so it’s important to know how to make Ubuntu happily coexist
    with Microsoft’s ubiquitous OS. Fortunately, Linux is just about the most accommodating
    operating system available and has no problems sharing files, reading Windows
    disks, and so forth. In fact, your Ubuntu programs probably support a wider range
    of file formats than their Windows equivalents; on more than one occasion I’ve
    tried to open a file in Windows, failed, and then booted into Ubuntu where I could
    open it effortlessly.

- en: Of course, sharing files with others may not be your only Windows-related worry,
    especially if you’re a dual-booter. Plenty of people decide to run both Windows
    and Linux on their computer, so it pays to know how you can minimize the bureaucracy
    involved in switching between the two. If you kept Windows for the sole purpose
    of running a specific application and you can’t find a Linux-compatible equivalent
    to it, perhaps you can save the effort of dual-booting altogether and simply install
    the program directly onto Ubuntu. I told you Linux was accommodating . . . it’ll
    even adopt Windows programs as its own!

    files and programs (see [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Wading and Diving")
    if you need a refresher on how partitions work). You can access files on Windows
    by *mounting* the partition from within Ubuntu. When you mount a partition, the
    files are made available to you through Nautilus (and other programs)—mounting
    is just Linux’s way of recognizing a partition and preparing it for use.

    in [Figure 19-1](ch19.html#mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus "Figure 19-1. Mounting
    a Windows partition in Nautilus")) or with the size of the partition followed
    by the word *Media* (for example, if your Windows partition is 80GB in size, it
    might appear as *80GB Media* in the sidebar). Or, it might be something else entirely.

    out. But what about going the other way and getting Windows to recognize your
    Linux partition? Unfortunately, Windows isn’t too helpful in this respect—it can
    view only FAT or NTFS-format partitions and has no built-in support for the ext
    format normally used by Linux. As such, if you need access to your Linux files
    in Windows, it’s probably easiest to create a separate FAT partition to be shared
    by both operating systems (see [Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. Manually Partitioning
    Your Hard Disk")). Hmm, not exactly convenient.

- en: One of the weirder things you can do with a computer is to run a simulation
    of a computer inside it. This simulation, known as *virtual machine (VM)* software,
    allows you to install one operating system inside another so you can run both
    at once without having to reboot. This is handy if you need to run Windows for
    some reason, perhaps for some specialized software, but are too comfortable working
    in Ubuntu to even contemplate going through the somewhat time-consuming rebooting
    procedure that dual-booters must follow to get back into Microsoft territory.
    You can even get Windows to sit there in, well, a window, which can be opened
    and closed at will just like any other program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some caveats. First, the virtual machine has to share your computer’s
    resources with all your other programs, so it can slow things down if you’re doing
    anything computationally strenuous. Second, it doesn’t have the same access to
    your computer’s hardware as the “real” operating system, so you probably won’t
    be able to get Windows-only devices working through the virtual machine very easily.
    Finally, and perhaps most awkwardly, you need a Windows installation CD to be
    able to put Windows into a VM, but most computers only come supplied with a recovery
    CD, which won’t do the trick.

    "Figure 19-12. Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine")).
    This can be a tough decision; on the one hand, you need enough memory for the
    “virtual” operating system to be able to run (Windows XP needs at least 128MB,
    for example), but on the other hand, you want to leave enough memory free for
    Ubuntu programs to be able to use it. VirtualBox normally suggests something sensible.

    is a folder on another computer that you can access as if it were on your own.
