<p>Welcome! Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, is the largest and most popular reference website in the world. Wikipedia is also unique: This encyclopedia is written by everyone and can be read by anyone.</p>
<p>This book is written for readers, current editors, potential contributors, and anyone else interested in Wikipedia. The book describes what kind of writing Wikipedia includes, how Wikipedia works behind the scenes, and how to get involved.</p>
<p>We cover all aspects of participating in Wikipedia, from reading the site to editing articles to navigating the site's community and governance.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is based on a <span class="emphasis"><em>wiki</em></span>, a technology that allows anyone to change pages easily on the site. If you're impatient to work on Wikipedia, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> and start improving the encyclopedia right now!</p>
<p>If you learn most quickly by diving right in, or if you already edit Wikipedia, then you can use this book as a reference guide and a source of tips. But if you're just starting out, or if you want to know everything about how Wikipedia works today and how it has developed over time, you should start reading from the beginning.</p>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="inside_this_book"></a>Inside This Book</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This book is divided into four parts, starting with the basics and working through all aspects of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Part I looks at Wikipedia from the reader's point of view. <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_02.html" title="Chapter&#160;1.&#160;What's in Wikipedia?">Chapter&#160;1</a> describes the type of content Wikipedia contains and the basic policies that determine what content is included. The site's history is explored in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_03.html" title="Chapter&#160;2.&#160;The World Gets a Free Encyclopedia">Chapter&#160;2</a>; in particular, we look at the way that Wikipedia unites three historical strands: encyclopedias, wikis, and free software. How to search and browse the site (including an explanation of the sidebar and main page) is detailed in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_04.html" title="Chapter&#160;3.&#160;Finding Wikipedia's Content">Chapter&#160;3</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_05.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Understanding and Evaluating an Article">Chapter&#160;4</a> covers the structure of an individual article and methods for evaluating article quality.</p>
<p>Part II turns to editing the site. A basic explanation of how to edit a page and an introduction to <span class="emphasis"><em>wikisyntax</em></span> are in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_07.html" title="Chapter&#160;5.&#160;Basic Editing">Chapter&#160;5</a>; this chapter forms the foundation for the next chapters in this part. <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_08.html" title="Chapter&#160;6.&#160;Good Writing and Research">Chapter&#160;6</a> covers how to start a new article and explores encyclopedic writing, research, and collaboration techniques that are useful for working on any article. Formal processes for maintaining content, including collaborative editing drives and cleanup projects, WikiProjects, and article deletion and promotion processes are covered in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_09.html" title="Chapter&#160;7.&#160;Cleanup, Projects, and Processes">Chapter&#160;7</a>. <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_10.html" title="Chapter&#160;8.&#160;Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web">Chapter&#160;8</a> explains how articles are linked together through Wikipedia's category structure, disambiguation pages, and redirects, along with how pages are maintained through merging, splitting, and moving. More advanced syntax, including image formatting, tables, templates, and special characters, is covered in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_11.html" title="Chapter&#160;9.&#160;Images, Templates, and Special Characters">Chapter&#160;9</a>. <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_12.html" title="Chapter&#160;10.&#160;The Life Cycle of an Article">Chapter&#160;10</a> steps through the life cycle of a newly created article.</p>
<p>Part III covers Wikipedia's elaborate social side. We begin with how to sign up as an editor, including setting up an account, setting preferences, and using your personal user and talk pages in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_14.html" title="Chapter&#160;11.&#160;Becoming a Wikipedian">Chapter&#160;11</a>, in which we also describe Wikipedia's administrator system. Wikipedia's culture and the ways editors communicate (including a list of forums for asking questions and discussing problems) are covered in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_15.html" title="Chapter&#160;12.&#160;Community and Communication">Chapter&#160;12</a>, and the policies that govern Wikipedia and how these policies are created are described in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_16.html" title="Chapter&#160;13.&#160;Policy and Your Input">Chapter&#160;13</a>. Finally, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_17.html" title="Chapter&#160;14.&#160;Disputes, Blocks, and Bans">Chapter&#160;14</a> discusses how the dispute resolution process works—and how to avoid disagreement in the first place.</p>
<p>Part IV steps back from the English-language Wikipedia to cover other Wikimedia Foundation projects, including editions of Wikipedia in other languages in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_19.html" title="Chapter&#160;15.&#160;200 Languages and Counting">Chapter&#160;15</a> and Wikipedia's sister projects, including Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikispecies, and Wikiversity, in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_20.html" title="Chapter&#160;16.&#160;Wikimedia Commons and Other Sister Projects">Chapter&#160;16</a>. Finally, we cover the Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia's parent organization) and how work at the Foundation level is coordinated in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_21.html" title="Chapter&#160;17.&#160;The Foundation and Project Coordination">Chapter&#160;17</a>.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_22.html" title="Appendix&#160;A.&#160;Reusing Wikimedia Content">Appendix&#160;A</a> includes information about reusing Wikipedia's content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License and examples of reuse (the GFDL itself, under which this book is licensed, is included starting on <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_27.html#preamble" title="PREAMBLE">PREAMBLE</a>). We provide a brief guide for teachers using Wikipedia in the classroom in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_23.html" title="Appendix&#160;B.&#160;Wikipedia for Teachers">Appendix&#160;B</a>; <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_24.html" title="Appendix&#160;C.&#160;Edit Summaries Jargon">Appendix&#160;C</a> contains a glossary of jargon commonly used in edit summaries; <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_25.html" title="Appendix&#160;D.&#160;Glossary">Appendix&#160;D</a> has a glossary of jargon frequently used on the site; and, finally, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_26.html" title="Appendix&#160;E.&#160;History">Appendix&#160;E</a> is an index of Wikipedia pages quoted in the book.</p>
<p>The basic principles we describe for reading articles, editing pages, and collaborating with others will provide a good foundation for working on any Wikimedia wiki project. But although the Wikimedia projects all share the same general philosophy, any specific policy or custom mentioned here might not apply outside the English-language Wikipedia. If you're interested in exploring another project, remember that each wiki website represents a unique collaborative community, which may have its own rules.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You don't need any prior experience with wikis or any knowledge of programming to use this book. But you should know how to access web pages on the Internet in the following ways:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Clicking a link with a mouse</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Typing a page address (URL) directly into your browser</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You should also know how to search the Web using Google or another search engine and have an active email account.</p>
<p>All references in this book to Wikipedia's interface assume that you're using a standard web browser on a personal computer, have logged into the English-language Wikipedia, and are using the default (Monobook) skin without modifications. If you use Wikipedia without logging in, not all tabs and sidebar links will display, but most other functions should be the same.</p>
<p>If you intend to view Wikipedia on a mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA), visit <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wap.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wap.wikipedia.org/</a>. This official mobile version was introduced in mid-2007; see [[Wikipedia:WAP access]] for unofficial versions.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wikipedia is always changing. It's a dynamic collection of web pages in constant motion, so although we've made this book as current as possible, specific details may have changed by the time you read these words. For this reason, we frequently reference pages on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Within the main text, Wikipedia page names are enclosed in double brackets like this: [[Help:Editing]]. You can go to that page on Wikipedia by typing one of the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The title <span class="emphasis"><em>Help:Editing</em></span> into the Wikipedia search box (do not insert a space after the colon)</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The URL of the page directly into your browser's address bar, for example, typing <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-1"></a>Note</h3>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>All English-language Wikipedia URLs begin with</em></span> <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>and the page name in double brackets always refers to the last part of the URL. So [[The Great Gatsby]] refers to</em></span> <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Spaces are automatically translated to underscores in the full URL; you do not need to type them in.</p>
<p>For certain community and policy pages, we provide shortcuts that are prefaced with <span class="emphasis"><em>WP</em></span>. Wikipedia contributors often use these shortcut abbreviations as shorthand in their discussions, for instance:</p>
<a id="I_programlisting_d1e241"></a><pre class="programlisting">[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]], shortcut WP:EDIT</pre>
<p>Type the shortcut into the Wikipedia search box to go the longer page title listed.</p>
<p>At the end of each section, we list the most important pages referred to. Here you can easily access the links on a given topic, which also serves as a reference if you're a more experienced Wikipedian. Every Wikipedia page that we quote directly is listed in <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_26.html" title="Appendix&#160;E.&#160;History">Appendix&#160;E</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="our_approach_to_understanding_wikipedia"></a>Our Approach to Understanding Wikipedia</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Most of the technical information we give is also available on Wikipedia's help and project pages, though these pages are not always neatly organized. In writing this book, we have tried to use our own experience to explain (and condense) a selection of the thousands and thousands of available pages of documentation. We spend time on spelling out unwritten customs and pointing out the implications of the most basic policies for a new editor to give a view of Wikipedia and how it actually works.</p>
<p>Although we attempt to express consensus views about how Wikipedia operates, the views represented in this book are solely those of the authors. They are not necessarily shared by other editors (including those quoted) or the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia is now <span class="emphasis"><em>enormous</em></span>, and every editor's experience on the site will be different. What you encounter as you work on Wikipedia may well vary from what we describe. The authors of this book have a combined 11 years' experience working on Wikipedia and over 150,000 edits, but we have still only directly experienced a portion of the site. In this book, we mostly talk about the common ground: general principles that should apply across the project.</p>
<p>Making absolute, definitive statements about Wikipedia is tricky. Even basic policies may be changed—tomorrow's Wikipedia may be different. Adaptability and change are, in fact, hallmarks of the project. All the same, much of the project setup, on its constitutional and policy side, seems to be relatively settled and understood across the editing community; and after seven years of existence, Wikipedia has a certain maturity. We have tried to be as accurate as possible at the moment of publication, but if you want more definite information, always refer to the live pages on the site itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="its_everyones_encyclopedia_be_boldexclam"></a>It's Everyone's Encyclopedia: Be Bold!</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you read this book, any time you're curious about a point, we very much encourage you to follow up by exploring and editing the live site at the same time. Wikipedia is open and welcoming to newcomers who make positive contributions, and you should be able to make a good start armed with the information we give.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be bold</em></span> is an old saying on the site. Be bold means that Wikipedia editors should update or change the encyclopedia whenever they see a problem and shouldn't feel inhibited by the editing process, which is forgiving. As you learn about Wikipedia, we encourage you to <span class="emphasis"><em>be bold</em></span> in improving the site, and we hope you find it as exciting as we do.</p>
<p>If you want to get started right away and are unfamiliar with wiki editing, here are the basic concepts for how Wikipedia works:</p>
<table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tbody><tr><td><span>Open and instantaneous editing</span> Wikipedia does not require that you register for an account to edit or create articles. Anyone who has a web browser and an Internet connection can add to or change content on the site. All changes are made instantaneously and are immediately visible online. (See <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_07.html" title="Chapter&#160;5.&#160;Basic Editing">Chapter&#160;5</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>A full record of edits</span> Wikipedia keeps a complete record of all changes that are made to any page. This <span class="emphasis"><em>page history</em></span> is viewable by everyone. Each time a page is changed, a new version is saved, but the old versions are not lost. (See <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_05.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Understanding and Evaluating an Article">Chapter&#160;4</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Special editing syntax</span> All content written on Wikipedia is formatted using a markup language, or <span class="emphasis"><em>wikisyntax</em></span>. This special language is considerably easier to learn than HTML, the source language of web pages. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_07.html" title="Chapter&#160;5.&#160;Basic Editing">Chapter&#160;5</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_10.html" title="Chapter&#160;8.&#160;Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web">Chapter&#160;8</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_11.html" title="Chapter&#160;9.&#160;Images, Templates, and Special Characters">Chapter&#160;9</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Linked pages</span> All pages on Wikipedia are linked to other Wikipedia pages to form a web of <span class="emphasis"><em>hypertext</em></span> or interlinked pages. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_04.html" title="Chapter&#160;3.&#160;Finding Wikipedia's Content">Chapter&#160;3</a> and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_10.html" title="Chapter&#160;8.&#160;Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web">Chapter&#160;8</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Multimedia content</span> Wikipedia has hundreds of thousands of images, sounds, and videos. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_11.html" title="Chapter&#160;9.&#160;Images, Templates, and Special Characters">Chapter&#160;9</a> and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_20.html" title="Chapter&#160;16.&#160;Wikimedia Commons and Other Sister Projects">Chapter&#160;16</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Content standards</span> Wikipedia doesn't take everything; all articles must be encyclopedic, neutral, and verifiable. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_02.html" title="Chapter&#160;1.&#160;What's in Wikipedia?">Chapter&#160;1</a> and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_08.html" title="Chapter&#160;6.&#160;Good Writing and Research">Chapter&#160;6</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Content up for discussion</span> Each wiki page and article has an associated discussion or talk page. Interested editors can discuss any changes to an article. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_05.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Understanding and Evaluating an Article">Chapter&#160;4</a> and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_15.html" title="Chapter&#160;12.&#160;Community and Communication">Chapter&#160;12</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Incremental improvements to articles</span> You may see warning or cleanup messages on articles as you browse; these alert you to problems and let other editors know that work needs to be done to that article. Wikipedia is a work in progress. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_05.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Understanding and Evaluating an Article">Chapter&#160;4</a> and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_09.html" title="Chapter&#160;7.&#160;Cleanup, Projects, and Processes">Chapter&#160;7</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Collaborative decision-making</span> Decisions are made through discussion and achieving consensus and through processes in which anyone can take part. Disputes are resolved the same way. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_09.html" title="Chapter&#160;7.&#160;Cleanup, Projects, and Processes">Chapter&#160;7</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_15.html" title="Chapter&#160;12.&#160;Community and Communication">Chapter&#160;12</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_16.html" title="Chapter&#160;13.&#160;Policy and Your Input">Chapter&#160;13</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_17.html" title="Chapter&#160;14.&#160;Disputes, Blocks, and Bans">Chapter&#160;14</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Community</span> A dedicated and complex volunteer community is behind Wikipedia, developing content, policies, and practices. Interactions with other editors should be civil and productive. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_03.html" title="Chapter&#160;2.&#160;The World Gets a Free Encyclopedia">Chapter&#160;2</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_14.html" title="Chapter&#160;11.&#160;Becoming a Wikipedian">Chapter&#160;11</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_15.html" title="Chapter&#160;12.&#160;Community and Communication">Chapter&#160;12</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_16.html" title="Chapter&#160;13.&#160;Policy and Your Input">Chapter&#160;13</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Not just the English-language Wikipedia</span> Wikipedias exist in many languages, and several other wiki reference projects with different types of content are all part of the Wikimedia Foundation. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_19.html" title="Chapter&#160;15.&#160;200 Languages and Counting">Chapter&#160;15</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_20.html" title="Chapter&#160;16.&#160;Wikimedia Commons and Other Sister Projects">Chapter&#160;16</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_21.html" title="Chapter&#160;17.&#160;The Foundation and Project Coordination">Chapter&#160;17</a>.)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><span>Totally free</span> All Wikipedia content is free to use and access; anyone is free to contribute; and all of the site's content is released under a free license, which means anyone may reuse it elsewhere. Wikipedia is a noncommercial project and has no advertisements. (See Chapters <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_02.html" title="Chapter&#160;1.&#160;What's in Wikipedia?">Chapter&#160;1</a>, <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_03.html" title="Chapter&#160;2.&#160;The World Gets a Free Encyclopedia">Chapter&#160;2</a>, and <a class="xref" href="hw-wkpd-wk_22.html" title="Appendix&#160;A.&#160;Reusing Wikimedia Content">Appendix&#160;A</a>.)</td>
