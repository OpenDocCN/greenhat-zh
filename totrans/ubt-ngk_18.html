If you're anything like me, you'll often find yourself working with people who use Windows, so it's important to know how to make Ubuntu happily coexist with Microsoft's ubiquitous OS. Fortunately, Linux is just about the most accommodating operating system available and has no problems sharing files, reading Windows disks, and so forth. In fact, your Ubuntu programs probably support a wider range of file formats than their Windows equivalents; on more than one occasion I've tried to open a file in Windows, failed, and then booted into Ubuntu where I could open it effortlessly.</p><p>Of course, sharing files with others may not be your only Windows-related worry, especially if you're a dual-booter. Plenty of people decide to run both Windows and Linux on their computer, so it pays to know how you can minimize the bureaucracy involved in switching between the two. If you kept Windows for the sole purpose of running a specific application and you can't find a Linux-compatible equivalent to it, perhaps you can save the effort of dual-booting altogether and simply install the program directly onto Ubuntu. I told you Linux was accommodating . . . it'll even adopt Windows programs as its own!</p><p>Over the course of this chapter, you'll learn how to make the most of your double operating system setup: You'll install some Windows fonts, install some Windows programs, and share files on a Windows network. And if that isn't quite enough Windows for you, you'll even see how to run Windows (in a window!) in Ubuntu. You might want to sit in a dark room for this one—if you're not tired of windows already, you will be by the end of the chapter!</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_18a_colon_accessing_files_on_you"/>Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</h1></div></div></div><p>If you decided to dual-boot with Windows when you installed Ubuntu, then you'll have a partition lurking somewhere on your hard disk filled with your Windows files and programs (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING">Chapter 2</a> if you need a refresher on how partitions work). You can access files on Windows by <span class="emphasis"><em>mounting</em></span> the partition from within Ubuntu. When you mount a partition, the files are made available to you through Nautilus (and other programs)—mounting is just Linux's way of recognizing a partition and preparing it for use.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1459" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1460" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="18A-1: Mounting Your Windows Partition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_mounting_your_windows_partitio"/>18A-1: Mounting Your Windows Partition</h2></div></div></div><p>Mounting your Windows partition in Linux used to be a bit of a chore, but that isn't the case anymore (at least not in Ubuntu). In fact, all you have to do is open a Nautilus window and click the Windows partition in the side pane.</p><p>You will most likely find at least two hard disk icons in the side pane, so it is possible that you won't be sure which one your Windows partition actually is. Just remember that your Linux partition is represented by the hard disk icon named <span class="emphasis"><em>File System</em></span>. Things aren't so simple for the Windows partition, unfortunately. It could be labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>OS</em></span> (as shown in the side pane in <a class="xref" href="ch18.html#mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus" title="Figure 18-1. Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus">Figure 18-1</a>) or with the size of the partition followed by the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Media</em></span> (for example, if your Windows partition is 80GB in size, it might appear as <span class="emphasis"><em>80GB Media</em></span> in the left pane). Or, it might be something else entirely. Guess which one it is, if necessary—it won't hurt if you get it wrong.</p><p>Now that you know which disk icon is which, it's time to get mounting! Just click the icon for the Windows partition in the Nautilus side pane. An Authenticate window may appear; type your Ubuntu password, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Authenticate</strong></span> button if it does. A new window showing the contents of your Windows partition will then appear.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you hibernated rather than quit Windows, you will most likely receive a "Cannot mount volume. You are not privileged to mount this volume." error message when trying to mount your Windows partition. Some hibernated Windows partitions cannot be safely read-write mounted in Linux, because adding new files while Windows is hibernated could seriously confuse it when it starts up again. To get full access to the drive, be sure to shut Windows down rather than hibernating.</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e22516"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656661.png.jpg" alt="Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-1. Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="18A-2: Unmounting Your Windows Partition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-2_colon_unmounting_your_windows_partit"/>18A-2: Unmounting Your Windows Partition</h2></div></div></div><p>You can unmount your Windows partition immediately after finishing your work with it, or you can just wait until you shut down your system, whereupon it will be automatically unmounted. Before you can unmount it yourself, you must first make sure that none of your programs is accessing files or folders on the partition. Nautilus and the Terminal are the usual suspects, so before unmounting, close any Nautilus or Terminal windows that are browsing that partition. Once you've done that, click the little eject icon next to the Windows partition in the side pane of a Nautilus window (<a class="xref" href="ch18.html#the_windows_partition_quotation_mark_os" title="Figure 18-2. The Windows partition &quot;OS&quot; in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon">Figure 18-2</a>), or right-click it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unmount</strong></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1461" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1462" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1463" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1464" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_windows_partition_quotation_mark_os"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e22550"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656663.png.jpg" alt="The Windows partition &quot;OS&quot; in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-2. The Windows partition "OS" in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon</p></div></div></div></div>

But what about going the other way and getting Windows to recognize your Linux partition? Unfortunately, Windows isn't too helpful in this respect—it can only view FAT or NTFS-format partitions and has no built-in support for the ext format normally used by Linux. As such, if you need access to your Linux files in Windows, it's probably easiest to create a separate FAT partition to be shared between both operating systems (see <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. MANUALLY PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK">Appendix C</a>). Hmmm, not exactly convenient.</p><p>An alternative is to add support for Linux partitions into Windows by installing some extra software. Unfortunately, the state of such software is pretty dire: Support for the old-fashioned ext2 format is pretty good, but Ubuntu uses ext4 nowadays, which is a different beast entirely. As far as I can tell, the best that people have managed to do is to get an ext4 partition mounted in Windows in read-only mode. Although you won't be able to add new files to the partition, at least you'll be able to see what's in there and copy them into Windows. See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.soluvas.com/read-browse-explore-open-ext2-ext3-ext4-partition-filesystem-from-windows-7/">http://www.soluvas.com/read-browse-explore-open-ext2-ext3-ext4-partition-filesystem-from-windows-7/</a> for an example of how you can do this.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1465" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Project 18B: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_18b_colon_installing_microsoft_w"/>Project 18B: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts</h1></div></div></div><p>Like it or not, the computing world is still pretty much a Microsoft world, and that means the vast majority of users, even Mac users, are using Microsoft fonts. That being the case, it is inevitable that you will have to deal with documents using fonts such as Georgia, Verdana, Times New Roman, and Courier, to name a few. Of course, your system can substitute the fonts it has for those used in the document. But for you to see things precisely as they were intended and to allow others to see your documents the way you intended, it will behoove you to install those Microsoft core fonts on your own system.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1466" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1467" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1468" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Fortunately for you, there are two ways to get these fonts. One is to download and install them via the Ubuntu Software Center, while the other, for those of you with a dual-boot setup, is to simply copy them from your Windows partition. In the former case, all you need to do is install the Microsoft Core Fonts package using the Ubuntu Software Center. This is the older set of fonts from Windows XP, so installing this package won't get you any of the swishy new fonts that are bundled with later Windows versions. When the installation process is complete, your new Microsoft fonts will have been successfully installed and made ready for immediate use by every user account on your machine.</p><p>If you're a dual-booter, you can copy the fonts directly from your Windows installation. This has the advantage of getting all your Windows fonts into Ubuntu, even the newer ones (if you have Vista or Windows 7 installed). Here's what you need to do:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Mount your Windows partition, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch18.html#project_18a_colon_accessing_files_on_you" title="Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)">Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch18.html#project_18a_colon_accessing_files_on_you" title="Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)">Project 18A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Windows partition in Nautilus, and browse to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows/Fonts</em></span> folder.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Now for a little trick: Select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Select Items Matching</strong></span>, type <strong class="userinput"><code>*.ttf</code></strong> in the box that appears, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch18s03.html#selecting_all_the_truetype_fonts_in_the" title="Figure 18-3. Selecting all the TrueType fonts in the Windows/Fonts folder">Figure 18-3</a>).

This is fine for people who want to use Ubuntu for almost everything but need to dip into Windows from time to time. If you spend more time in Windows, however, you might prefer to use that as the default operating system. To make the change, first use the Ubuntu Software Center to install StartUp-Manager, and then open it by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>StartUp-Manager</strong></span>. You'll probably be asked to enter your password, so do that and then wait a little while as it loads.

To fix this problem, open the StartUp-Manager, and reselect Windows as the default operating system again.</p></div><p>The StartUp-Manager lets you change the boot timeout too. By default, GRUB waits for 10 seconds before loading your default operating system, but I'm impatient and find this far too long to wait—so impatient, in fact, that I changed the Timeout in seconds option (also on the Boot options tab) to one so the menu is displayed only for a second. This might sound fast, but when I want to get into Windows, all I do is press the down arrow key a few times while my computer starts up.

In this example, I'll install the delightful Crayon Physics game:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Games</strong></span> category, and find the Crayon Physics entry in the list (not the Deluxe version).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Crayon Physics</strong></span> (as in <a class="xref" href="ch18s06.html#selecting_a_windows_application_to_insta" title="Figure 18-10. Selecting a Windows application to install in PlayOnLinux">Figure 18-10</a>), and click <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to start the installation process.

Every time you get the star, you move to the next level, where you'll be forced to come up with a more ingenious ball-rolling strategy. It sounds simple, but I promise you it's addictive!</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_main_playonlinux_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e23057"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656677.png.jpg" alt="The main PlayOnLinux window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-9. The main PlayOnLinux window</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_a_windows_application_to_insta"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e23065"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656679.png.jpg" alt="Selecting a Windows application to install in PlayOnLinux"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-10. Selecting a Windows application to install in PlayOnLinux</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="playing_the_crayon_physics_game_comma_co"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e23073"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656681.png.jpg" alt="Playing the Crayon Physics game, courtesy of PlayOnLinux"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-11. Playing the Crayon Physics game, courtesy of PlayOnLinux</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Installing Windows Inside Ubuntu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="installing_windows_inside_ubuntu"/>Installing Windows Inside Ubuntu</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the weirder things you can do with a computer is to run a simulation of a computer inside it. This simulation, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual machine (VM)</em></span> software, allows you to install one operating system inside another, so you can run both at once without having to reboot. This is handy if you need to run Windows for some reason, perhaps for some specialized software, but are too comfortable working in Ubuntu to even contemplate going through the somewhat time-consuming rebooting procedure that dual-booters must follow to get back into Microsoft territory. You can even get Windows to sit there in, well, a window, which can be opened and closed at will just like any other program.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1492" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1493" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1494" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1495" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1496" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There are some caveats. First, the virtual machine has to share your computer's resources with all your other programs, so it can slow things down if you're doing anything computationally strenuous. Second, it doesn't have the same access to your computer's hardware as the "real" operating system, so you probably won't be able to get Windows-only devices working through the virtual machine. Finally, and perhaps most awkwardly, you need a Windows installation CD to be able to put Windows into a VM, but most computers only come supplied with a recovery CD, which won't do the trick.</p><p>If you do have an installation CD, getting Windows into a VM doesn't take much more work than getting it onto a real computer:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Ubuntu Software Center, and install VirtualBox.

This can be a tough decision; on one hand, you need enough memory for the "virtual" operating system to be able to run (Windows XP needs at least 128MB, for example), but you want to leave enough memory free for Ubuntu programs to be able to use it. VirtualBox normally suggests something sensible.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> again, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Create new hard disk</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch18s07.html#creating_a_new_virtual_hard_disk" title="Figure 18-13. Creating a new virtual hard disk">Figure 18-13</a>).

Again, choose a size that's big enough to run the virtual OS but small enough that it doesn't engulf your entire hard disk.</p><div class="figure"><a id="choosing_how_much_memory_to_allocate_to"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e23175"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656683.png.jpg" alt="Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-12. Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_new_virtual_hard_disk"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e23183"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656685.png.jpg" alt="Creating a new virtual hard disk"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-13. Creating a new virtual hard disk</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you choose <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamically expanding storage</em></span> as the storage type, the virtual disk will start off small and grow in size as you add more files in the virtual machine.

You might be familiar with this concept already; network shares are used in many workplaces, and you may have even set one up before on your home network. For the uninitiated, a network share is a folder on another computer that you can access as if it were on your own. Files are transferred around on the network, so there's no need to use a portable hard disk or flash drive to get them from one place to another.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-1497" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1498" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1499" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1500" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1501" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1502" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1503" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1504" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-1505" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Accessing Files Stored on a Windows Computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="accessing_files_stored_on_a_windows_comp"/>Accessing Files Stored on a Windows Computer</h2></div></div></div><p>Network shares are a two-way thing: You can either share your files with others by creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>shared folder</em></span> or access existing shared folders created by other people.
