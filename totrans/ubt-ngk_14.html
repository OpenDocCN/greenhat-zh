Yes, Linux does indeed rock, and in this chapter you will find out about those musical talents that your system possesses. You will learn how to rip CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files (files that you can recognize by their <span class="emphasis"><em>.mp3</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>.ogg</em></span> filename extensions), add album cover art, change file tags, play music files, and burn files onto audio CDs that you can play in any CD player. You'll also learn how to play a variety of audio streams. If you're interested in learning how to work with your iPod, iPhone, or other digital media device, or how to convert audio files from one format to another, well, you'll have to wait until <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. PLUGGIN' IN THE PENGUIN">Chapter 15</a>.</p><div class="sect1" title="Audio File Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="audio_file_formats"/>Audio File Formats</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we go any further, it is probably best to discuss the various formats in which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.wav</em></span> extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.au</em></span> extension), and AIFF (from Apple and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>.aiff</em></span> extension), all of which are uncompressed formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly large, with an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB per minute. To put that in perspective, back in 1988 my first Macintosh had a 40MB hard disk—more space than I thought I would ever need but not enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana's "Come as You Are."<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1241" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they are today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about those disk-space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus developed. These compression formats work, to oversimplify things a bit, by cutting out the portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear—sort of a dog-whistle approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio compression formats is MP3. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1242" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1243" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another audio compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. Ogg Vorbis was a product of the open source community, so, unlike MP3, which has always been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, it was free of patent and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of that and the fact that it was the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not, as many claim, better), Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the Linux community.</p><p>As you work with ripping audio files in this chapter, you are sure to notice yet another encoding option—FLAC. Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is an encoding format that, unlike the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats, does not remove any audio information from the audio file during the encoding process. The downside of this is that FLAC provides space savings of only 30 to 50 percent, which is much less than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. The upside, of course, is that the FLAC files should be equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1244" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC becomes an ideal choice if you are not satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 files. It is also a good choice if you want to create both Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files . . . or if you just don't know which one you want to work with yet. In such cases, you can just rip the file and encode it in FLAC format. As I mentioned earlier, once you get to <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. PLUGGIN' IN THE PENGUIN">Chapter 15</a>, you will learn how you can convert the FLAC file later, when you know what you want or need.</p></div></div>

You may, for example, already have numerous MP3 files ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy listening to one of the many Internet radio streams that are broadcast in MP3 format. Unfortunately, MP3 playback and encoding support is not included in Ubuntu because of licensing concerns. Even if you plan on using the Ogg Vorbis format in your future ripping and encoding endeavors, installing MP3 support is a good idea so as to cover all your audio bases. It's also a very easy process.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1245" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1246" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1247" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1248" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1249" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1250" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1251" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The easiest way to install MP3 playback support is to double-click an MP3 file that you have on your hard disk. A window will appear, asking whether you want to search for the plug-ins necessary to play the file. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Search</strong></span>, after which another window will appear, showing you what you need to install (<a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n" title="Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.">Figure 14-1</a>). Check both boxes in that window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> button, and in the confirmation window that then appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Confirm</strong></span>. You will then be asked for your password, so provide it, and then just wait until the process is complete. Once done, you'll be able to play not only your MP3 audio files but also MPEG and WMV videos.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e19271"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656543.png.jpg" alt="Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.</p></div><p>If you prefer, you can download and install these plug-ins quite easily via the Ubuntu Software Center by doing a search for <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer</em></span> and then installing <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg</em></span> (GStreamer ffmpeg video plugin), <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3</em></span> (Fluendo mp3 decoder GStreamer plugin), and <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly</em></span> (GStreamer extra plugins).</p><p>As for MP3 encoding support, which enables you to rip CDs and create your own space-saving MP3 files, well, things aren't so automatic. But it's not much of a chore, either, because all you need to do is use the Ubuntu Software Center to search for and install <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse</em></span>. If you also want to give yourself AAC encoding ability, you should install <span class="emphasis"><em>gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse</em></span> as well. You will then be ready for action, as described in the next section.</p></div>

It's a relatively easy-to-use audio player that, despite some quirkiness in its early stages, has developed quite a following in the Linux world. To run Rhythmbox, just go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Sound &amp; Video</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Rhythmbox Music Player</strong></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1254" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1255" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1252" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-14-1253" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_rhythmbox_audio_player"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject14_d1e19334"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656545.png.jpg" alt="The Rhythmbox audio player"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 14-2. The Rhythmbox audio player</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Adding Songs and Albums to the Rhythmbox Library"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="adding_songs_and_albums_to_the_rhythmbox"/>Adding Songs and Albums to the Rhythmbox Library</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are familiar with Apple's iTunes, then you should understand the Library in Rhythmbox too, because it is essentially the same concept. Rhythm-box should automatically import everything you have in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder without any extra work on your part. If you prefer to add songs to the Rhythmbox library manually, you can open the preferences window (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>), click the <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> tab, and then uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch my library for new files</strong></span> box. After that, you can add new albums to your Rhythmbox Library by going to the <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> menu, selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Import Folder</strong></span>, and then navigating to the folder for the new album you want to add. If you want to add a number of albums by the same artist, just navigate to and select the folder for that artist instead. If you want to add just a single audio file, you can also do that—select <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Import File</strong></span>, and then navigate to the song in question.</p><p>If you are not the navigating type, you can also add files and folders by other means. The simplest way is to drag the folder or song you want to add to the Library into the right pane of the Rhythmbox window.

To go this route, place a blank CD in your drive (and close the Nautilus window that pops up to handle it), and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Sound &amp; Video</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Brasero Disc Burner</strong></span>. When Brasero appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Audio project</strong></span>. Now add any mix of songs (in any mix of audio formats) to the blank area of the window. You can do this by navigating to the songs you want in the left panes and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button (or just dragging the files to the right pane).

Once you are ready, just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> in the setup window that appears after that. A progress window will appear, and once the burn is complete, Brasero will let you know and eject your disk.

Check out Exaile, Banshee, Audacious, and Listen to get started. Oh, and as you'll find out in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. COUCH PENGUINS">Chapter 16</a>, if you haven't discovered it already, the Totem video player that comes with your system also doubles as an audio player.

Streamtuner is, as its name implies, an online radio stream tuner. It works by downloading lists of available streams from a variety of sources, which you can then easily browse. When you find something you like, just select the stream, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Tune in</strong></span> button, and the stream will open in the player of your choice. The default player for most streams is Audacious, so when you download Streamtuner, the Ubuntu Software Center will also automatically download Audacious, which is a pretty cool audio player. You can, however, switch the default player for Streamtuner playback by going to its <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> menu, selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>, and then in the right pane of the Preferences window, changing the default applications for playback by typing the command for the application you want to use. This is usually the name of the application in all lowercase letters. For example, if you want your playback to be from Totem, you would click <span class="strong"><strong>Listen to a .m3u file</strong></span>, scroll to the right, and change <code class="literal">audacious %q</code> to <strong class="userinput"><code>totem %q</code></strong>.<a id="IDX-CHP-14-1280" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You'll also be happy to know that you can rip the streams you are listening to (and even those you aren't listening to) and save them as MP3 files.
