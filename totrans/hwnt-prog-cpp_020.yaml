    If you're becoming a programmer, you *will* make this mistake. And it will drive

- en: 'I was working for a major software manufacturer on an international version
    of our word processor. The start-up screen contained the release date in the form
    mm/dd/yy, for example 09/20/83\. But Europe uses dd/mm/yy as its standard. Needing
    guidance I asked the boss which form to use. He took it under advisement and spent
    about a month talking to his managers about it. He didn''t get back to me until
    a week after I released the software. In the meantime I solved the problem by
    scheduling the release on November 11\. That''s right: 11/11/83.'
