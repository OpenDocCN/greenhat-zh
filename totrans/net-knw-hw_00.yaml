- en: This book is for people who never expected to build or run a computer network.
    You were happily using a computer, sending and receiving email, writing reports,
    and maybe downloading music through the Internet when one day you looked around
    to discover that one computer had somehow multiplied—now you have two, or three,
    or more computers. Maybe each of your children needs his or her own computer to
    do homework or all of your employees have computers on their desks. Or maybe you
    brought a portable laptop computer home from work and you want to use it along
    with the family's desktop machine.

- en: Whatever the reason, you now have several computers, and you need a way to connect
    all of them to the Internet at the same time and to share files, printers, and
    other resources among them. You need a network.

- en: A network? Yikes! Isn't a network some kind of invisible monster that requires
    expensive equipment and people to keep it running who speak a mysterious language
    and go off to seminars with titles like "The Power of Virtualization" or "Removing
    Internet Anonymity Barriers with IP Intelligence"?

- en: Not necessarily. Networks are not just for geeks any more. Today's small networks
    are relatively easy to install, and you don't need an advanced course in computer
    technology to operate them. Even the smallest of small businesses will probably
    benefit from having a network. And home networks are becoming common household
    utilities, just like water, electricity, and cable TV. Like those other utilities,
    you don't need a technical background to use a network. This book will tell you
    what you need to know to build and use a small, simple network in your home or
    business without becoming mired in obscure technical details.

- en: 'We thought about calling this book *Networks for Nitwits*, but that''s not
    quite what the book is about—you''re not a nitwit; you''re an intelligent computer
    user who has been dragged into the world of networks. I suggested *The Bridges
    and Routers of Madison County*, but that would be an entirely different book:
    the bittersweet tale of an Iowa housewife who finds romance with an itinerant
    network installer. Somebody should probably write that book, but this isn''t it.'

- en: This *is* a guide to navigating the jungle of servers, routers, modems, and
    Ethernet cables and to getting the most out of your small network. I'll explain
    how networks operate (without getting into too much tedious technical detail),
    describe each part of a network, and tell you how to use the network with computers
    running Windows XP and Vista, Macintosh OS X, and several versions of Linux and
    Unix. I'll also tell you about some other ways you can use your network, including
    automating household appliances and distributing digital audio and video to computers,
    home entertainment systems, and "Internet radios" throughout your house.

- en: The ideal network is the one that you—and the other people using your network—never
    have to think about. You would plug a cable from each computer into an outlet,
    and every other computer on the network would immediately recognize it. And the
    network would simply *be* there, ready to use. Or it would be completely invisible,
    like the wires that provide electricity to the lamp next to the chair where you're
    reading this. If you think about it, you don't really want a network; you want
    to see and hear files and other resources that are located beyond your own computer.
    A network is the means to that end.

  zh: 理想中的网络是你以及使用你网络的其他人永远不会需要去思考的网络。你只需将每台电脑的电缆插入插座，网络上的其他电脑会立即识别它。网络将简单地“存在”在那里，随时可用。或者它将完全隐形，就像为坐在你阅读这本书的椅子旁边的台灯提供电线的那些线缆一样。如果你仔细想想，你其实并不需要一个网络；你想要看到和听到位于你电脑之外的其他文件和资源。网络是实现这一目标的手段。
- en: 'As I wrote this book, I kept several goals in mind: First, I wanted to provide
    enough information that readers with some basic computer knowledge and skills
    could understand how networks work and how to plan and install their own small
    network; second, I wanted readers to think about additional uses for their networks;
    and third, I wanted to offer advice and tools for fixing a network that isn''t
    working correctly. If I have succeeded, your network will be up and running shortly
    after you follow the book''s instructions and recommendations.'

  zh: 在我撰写这本书的过程中，我始终牢记几个目标：首先，我希望提供足够的信息，让具备一些基本计算机知识和技能的读者能够理解网络是如何工作的，以及如何规划和安装他们自己的小型网络；其次，我希望读者能够思考他们网络的额外用途；第三，我希望提供关于修复不正常工作的网络的建议和工具。如果我能成功，那么在你遵循书中的指示和建议后，你的网络将很快就能正常运行。
- en: '*Network Know-How* begins with a general overview of networks and the things
    you can do with them. In later chapters, you will learn how networks handle digital
    data, how different kinds of networks move that data from one place to another,
    and how the equipment at the core of most networks—hubs, routers, modems, and
    other devices—works. Next, I''ll introduce the important concepts of clients and
    servers and tell you how to design and install simple wired and wireless networks,
    how to connect the local network to the Internet, how to build security into your
    network, and how to use your network for music and video along with computer data.
    And finally, the last chapter of the book offers advice about troubleshooting
    and describes some useful tools that might make life a bit easier when it becomes
    necessary to find and fix a problem.'

  zh: 《网络知能》从对网络及其可用性的概述开始。在后面的章节中，你将学习网络如何处理数字数据，不同种类的网络如何将数据从一个地方传输到另一个地方，以及大多数网络核心设备——集线器、路由器、调制解调器和其他设备的工作原理。接下来，我将介绍客户端和服务器的重要概念，并告诉你如何设计和安装简单的有线和无线网络，如何将本地网络连接到互联网，如何将安全性融入你的网络，以及如何使用你的网络来传输音乐、视频和计算机数据。最后，本书的最后一章提供了关于故障排除的建议，并描述了一些可能在需要寻找和修复问题时使生活变得更容易的一些有用工具。
- en: When you have a network in your home or small business, all the computers connected
    to the network will become more flexible and more useful. Your new network will
    change the way you use your computer; within a few weeks or less, you will definitely
    wonder how you got along without it. When you and the other people connected to
    your network find yourself using it without thinking about "the network," you
    and I will both have met our objectives.

  zh: 当你在家庭或小型企业中拥有一个网络时，连接到网络的所有电脑将变得更加灵活和有用。你的新网络将改变你使用电脑的方式；在几周或更短的时间内，你肯定会想知道没有它你是如何度过的。当你和连接到你的网络的其他人发现自己在使用它时不再需要思考“网络”，那么我和你都将达到我们的目标。
