A single drawing of a rose is rendered in a different way in each of the five square windows as well as in the background. Thus, a single tutorial showing all stages of creating this image is equivalent to at least six different tutorials teaching you six different ways to draw a rose—or anything else, for that matter.</p><p>We will start with a photo. You don’t have to, of course; if you can draw better than me, you can just draw anything you like on an empty canvas. Tracing a photo, however, is a useful technique by itself.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00852"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735498.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) the photo, scale and position it as convenient. Rename the layer where the image is <code class="literal">background</code> and create a new layer, <code class="literal">ink</code>; we will need to hide and show the photo a lot, and it’s much easier to do when it’s in a layer of its own. It makes sense to reduce the opacity of the photo and lock its layer so you don’t move it accidentally. After that, just start to trace over the outlines and the boundaries between colors in the photo (<a class="xref" href="ch24.html#importing_the_image_and_setting_up_traci" title="Figure 24-1. Importing the image and setting up tracing using the Calligraphic pen">Figure 24-1</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="importing_the_image_and_setting_up_traci"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00413"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736490.png.jpg" alt="Importing the image and setting up tracing using the Calligraphic pen"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-1. Importing the image and setting up tracing using the Calligraphic pen</p></div><p><a id="iddle1196" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1392" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3454" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3494" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4543" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4549" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4573" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4815" class="indexterm"/>Which tool to use for tracing an image depends on the nature of the image and the result you want to get. If you’re tracing geometric shapes, easily representable by straight lines and Bézier segments, use the Pen tool. If you need more freeform and artistic shapes while still minimizing the number of paths and nodes, the Pencil tool is a better choice. Finally, if you are after an especially expressive, possibly even “untidy” style, use the Calligraphic pen. I wanted my drawing to be laconic but artistic and natural, and I had no reason to save on the number of nodes, so I used the Calligraphic pen:</p><div class="figure"><a id="tracing_complete_106_path_objects_in_ink"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00414"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736492.png.jpg" alt="Tracing complete: 106 path objects in ink"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-2. Tracing complete: 106 path objects in <code class="literal">ink</code></p></div><p>I used a pressure-sensitive tablet pen that allowed me to vary the width of the brush stroke depending on how hard I pressed the pen. However, you can achieve a similar result with nothing but a regular mouse. Why? Because controlling the stroke thickness with pen pressure, while easy in theory, rarely comes out exactly as desired on the first try. A much more efficient approach is to draw with a limited range of width in the Calligraphic pen and then apply the Tweak tool’s Shrink/Grow mode (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s06.html#one2dot6dot4_shrinksolidusgrow_mode" title="12.6.4 Shrink/Grow Mode">12.6.4 Shrink/Grow Mode</a></strong></span>) to thicken or thin your strokes where appropriate:</p><div class="figure"><a id="tweaking_the_drawing_with_the_tweak_tool"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00415"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736494.png.jpg" alt="Tweaking the drawing with the Tweak tool"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-3. Tweaking the drawing with the Tweak tool</p></div><p><a id="iddle1339" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1665" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1805" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2282" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4781" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4926" class="indexterm"/>The black and white outline is ready—now we need to add color to it. With a crisp ink outline, it makes sense to try a softer method of coloring. First, hide the <code class="literal">background</code> layer. Then, create a new layer, <code class="literal">watercolor</code>, and put it below your <code class="literal">ink</code> layer. After that, with wide calligraphic strokes, make a few wild brush strokes: red under the rose, green under the stalk and leaf, and various shades of blue around those. Finally, blur these strokes by a large enough radius that they begin to blend together:</p><div class="figure"><a id="adding_blurred_background"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00416"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736496.png.jpg" alt="Adding blurred background"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-4. Adding blurred background</p></div><p>This already looks nice—but not nice enough. The smoothly blurred blotches are <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> smooth—and boring. In a quest to make them look more natural, I tried to expand the simple <span class="strong"><strong>Gaussian Blur</strong></span> filter which I had applied to the background by adding more primitives. First, I added a <span class="strong"><strong>Turbulence</strong></span> primitive, composited with the blur, to imitate paper grain. This looked better but still too uniform, too obviously computer-generated. I then added another <span class="strong"><strong>Turbulence</strong></span> component with a much larger period, which I used twice: once, via a <span class="strong"><strong>Displacement Map</strong></span>, for making the overall watercolor more blotchy and splotchy; and then, via a <span class="strong"><strong>Composite</strong></span> operator, for modulating the small-scale paper grain to imitate a more realistic paper where some areas are smoother and others are more rough and grainy:</p><div class="figure"><a id="building_up_the_quotation_markrealistic"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00417"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736498.png.jpg" alt="Building up the “realistic watercolor” filter for the background"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-5. Building up the “realistic watercolor” filter for the background</p></div><p><a id="iddle1398" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2024" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2466" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2604" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2927" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3197" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3362" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3804" class="indexterm"/>The final composite filter, which I called <span class="emphasis"><em>Sandy Blur</em></span> (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch17s04.html#one7dot4dot2_the_stack_of_primitives" title="17.4.2 The Stack of Primitives">17.4.2 The Stack of Primitives</a></strong></span> for more on it), looked a lot more realistic—although much slower to render. At this point I had to switch to working mostly in the Outline (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s11.html" title="3.11 Rendering Modes">3.11 Rendering Modes</a></strong></span>) or No Filters modes (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch17s04.html#one7dot4dot4_the_filter_area" title="17.4.4 The Filter Area">17.4.4 The Filter Area</a></strong></span>).</p><p>As a final step (see the cover for the end result), according to taste, you could duplicate the content of the <code class="literal">ink</code> layer and blur it to form a shadow, or (as I did) soften the ink lines slightly by outsetting (thickening) the duplicated ink paths and making them semitransparent.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="24.1 Treatment 1: Engraving"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two4dot1_treatment_1_engraving"/>24.1 Treatment 1: Engraving</h1></div></div></div><p>After finishing the <code class="literal">ink</code> and <code class="literal">watercolor</code> layers, I went on to create a number of other treatments of the drawing—variations on the same basic theme. My goal was to demonstrate several characteristic treatments in one image, so I overlaid the rose with five randomly scattered squares and limited each treatment to its own square.</p><p>First comes an engraving-like rendition composed of lattices of curved variable-width pen strokes. For this treatment, I chose an area of the rose where the curving and shading of the petals was especially deep and prominent. Engraving is an intricate art; I do not claim that my simulation of it is any good—but I was surprised to find how easy it was to do using Inkscape’s tools.</p><p>Once you have an outline drawing and want to turn it into an engraving, the first step is planning: Think about the best and most natural way to direct the engraving lines in each part of the drawing. Create a new layer and draw several wide-spaced test strokes with the Calligraphic pen, looking for the best way to capture the changing curvature of each area while maintaining the best directional contrast at the boundaries where areas of different curvature meet:</p><div class="figure"><a id="choosing_the_engraving_square_and_doing"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00418"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736500.png.jpg" alt="Choosing the engraving square and doing test strokes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-6. Choosing the engraving square and doing test strokes</p></div><p>Once you get an idea of how you want the engraving strokes to go, move the test strokes aside (but keep them for reference) and use Calligraphic pen’s guide tracking feature (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot7_tracking_a_guide_path" title="14.3.7 Tracking a Guide Path">14.3.7 Tracking a Guide Path</a></strong></span>) to fill each area with evenly spaced uniform-width strokes, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch24s01.html#creating_an_evenly_spaced_lattice_with_t" title="Figure 24-7. Creating an evenly spaced lattice with the Calligraphic pen">Figure 24-7</a>. Don’t worry if the direction or curvature of your strokes drifts off somewhat; you will be able to fix that later. What matters more at this stage is the uniformity of spacing. You can temporarily rotate the entire drawing so it’s more natural for stroking. Try to draw beyond the edges of the <a id="iddle1736" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3399" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4582" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4816" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4820" class="indexterm"/>area you’re filling; it will be much easier to trim strokes that are too long than to extend those which fell short.</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_an_evenly_spaced_lattice_with_t"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00419"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736502.png.jpg" alt="Creating an evenly spaced lattice with the Calligraphic pen"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-7. Creating an evenly spaced lattice with the Calligraphic pen</p></div><p>The rest of the work is done in the Tweak tool—without which, really, the task of creating a decent looking engraving would be impossible. Use the Shrink mode to trim line ends and thin them, the Grow mode to make them thicker, and the Push mode to move and curve the entire lattice (you must have all strokes of the lattice selected to affect them all at once). Don’t worry about the unsightly ends of the trimmed strokes—in the final result they will be covered by the wide boundary strokes of the <code class="literal">ink</code> layer:</p><div class="figure"><a id="finalizing_the_engraving_with_the_tweak"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00420"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736504.png.jpg" alt="Finalizing the engraving with the Tweak tool"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-8. Finalizing the engraving with the Tweak tool</p></div><p>In a real, physical engraving, you typically cut away areas which are to appear white, rather than directly drawing areas which are to be black. This is one of the reasons the example looks less like authentic engraving than it otherwise might.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="24.2 Treatment 2: Tessellation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="two4dot2_treatment_2_tessellation"/>24.2 Treatment 2: Tessellation</h1></div></div></div><p>This treatment is easier to do than others because it’s mostly automatic. The only tricky part is creating the tessellation itself—that is, a pattern of complex interlocked tiles that cover the entire plane without holes or overlapping.</p><p>Draw a shape—any shape!—and create a pattern of tiled clones from it (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Clone</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Create Tiled Clones</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html" title="16.6 Tiling Clones">16.6 Tiling Clones</a></strong></span>) with any nontrivial symmetry group; <a id="iddle1717" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1723" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1738" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2702" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4722" class="indexterm"/>in this example I used P3. At first, the clones do not form any kind of tessellation; it is your task to reshape the source shape—with its clones already in place— until the clones meet and smoothly interlock. It is much easier than it might seem; the fact that the clones immediately reflect any change in the source shape makes it almost trivial. Just add nodes and move them to grow appendages in your shape. Each of the clones will grow similar appendages. Simply keep adjusting them until the shapes meet all the way around and cover the plane:</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_tessellation"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00421"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736506.png.jpg" alt="Creating a tessellation"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-9. Creating a tessellation</p></div><p>Next, we want the pattern to reflect the colors of the background—so that the rose drawing shows through. Once you set it up, the process is mostly automatic. Make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Use saved size and position of the tile</strong></span> checkbox is on, delete the existing tiling (<span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button), and set the <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> so that the pattern covers all of the area you need covered. Unset the fill color of the original shape (right-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill:</strong></span> swatch in the status bar and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Unset</strong></span>). Then, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Trace</strong></span> tab, enable <span class="strong"><strong>Trace the drawing under the tiles</strong></span>, pick <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span>, and apply the picked value to the clones’ <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> as well:</p><div class="figure"><a id="color_tracing_with_the_tessellation"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00422"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736508.png.jpg" alt="Color tracing with the tessellation"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-10. Color tracing with the tessellation</p></div><p>The final touch is adding slight glossy highlights to the tiles using filters (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Filters">Chapter 17</a>). One problem with this is that the gloss filter is not symmetric—it has one special direction from which the light is cast. However, if we apply such a filter to rotated <span class="emphasis"><em>clones</em></span> in the pattern, the filter will be rotated together with the clones and all highlights will appear as if lit from different directions. To work around this, simply group all tiled clones (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00853"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735504.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and apply the <span class="strong"><strong>Jigsaw Piece</strong></span> filter from <span class="strong"><strong>Filters</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Bevels</strong></span> to the group, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch24s02.html#adding_highlights" title="Figure 24-11. Adding highlights">Figure 24-11</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="adding_highlights"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00423"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736510.png.jpg" alt="Adding highlights"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-11. Adding highlights</p></div></div>

However, in most other respects it is different: It is randomized instead of regular, pseudo-3D instead of flat, and uses three different original objects—and thus three intermingled patterns—instead of a single one.</p><p>Let’s start by drawing these three original objects by the 3D Box tool. Convert each of them to a group of paths (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00854"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735780.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) and duplicate (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00855"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>). In the bottom copy of a box, enter it as a group, select all six sides and union them (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00856"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735892.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), then ungroup. This turns a box into a single box-shaped path; unset its fill— in the clones, this one will take the color of the backround. For the second copy of the box, use 50% opacity and white or black color; this will be the shading that will allow each box look like a box despite changing overall color. Finally, group the background shape and the shading into a single group.</p><div class="figure"><a id="original_objects_for_the_cube_scattering"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00424"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736512.png.jpg" alt="Original objects for the cube scattering"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-12. Original objects for the cube scattering</p></div><p>Now, for each of the prepared cubes, create a P1-symmetry scattering over the area you want to cover, using color-to-color tracing in the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Tiled Clones</strong></span> dialog (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html#one6dot6dot6_tracing" title="16.6.6 Tracing">16.6.6 Tracing</a></strong></span>). Randomize their rotation (slightly, so as to not destroy the perception of all boxes being in a common perspective), their size, and their position. To imitate the effect of a 3D field, set scaling and row spacing to increase from top to bottom (i.e., per row), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch24s03.html#scattering_the_cubes" title="Figure 24-13. Scattering the cubes">Figure 24-13</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="scattering_the_cubes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00425"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736514.png.jpg" alt="Scattering the cubes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-13. Scattering the cubes</p></div><p><a id="iddle1148" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1627" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1740" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1927" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3717" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4796" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4849" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5030" class="indexterm"/>Now, repeat this procedure for the two other cubes we’ve prepared, covering the same area.

To fix this, use the <span class="strong"><strong>Restack</strong></span> extension (from <span class="strong"><strong>Extensions</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Arrange</strong></span>) to rearrange the z-order of the boxes so that they stack from top to bottom. Then, perform a single <span class="strong"><strong>Unclump</strong></span> action from the <span class="strong"><strong>Align and Distribute</strong></span> dialog so that there are fewer gaps in the arrangement of cubes.</p><div class="figure"><a id="z-order_sorting_and_unclumping_the_cubes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00426"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736516.png.jpg" alt="Z-order sorting and unclumping the cubes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-14. Z-order sorting and unclumping the cubes</p></div><p>Remember that our eventual goal is to trace a square area of the rose’s <code class="literal">background</code> layer.

This is inevitable, as the boxes are relatively large and sample color from large areas, averaging it and therefore making it less saturated than the original background image.</p><p>So, it looks like we will need to paint the cubes manually. Just select all the cube clones, choose the Color Paint mode of the Tweak tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html" title="8.7 Color Tweaking">8.7 Color Tweaking</a></strong></span>), choose a bright red color (or pick it from the background image with Dropper, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s06.html" title="8.6 The Dropper Tool">8.6 The Dropper Tool</a></strong></span>) and paint over the red area of the image.

The key here is the proper use of shapes, gradient, and blur.</p><p>After positioning the square in which we’re going to work, reveal the layer where you have the source photo.

What we have created is just a layer of rough background paint, upon which the fine details are to be overlaid, reproducing the characteristic wrinkles and texture of the rose petals. Your primary tool will now be the Calligraphic pen (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html" title="14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool">14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool</a></strong></span>) with relatively small <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span>, zero <span class="strong"><strong>Fixation</strong></span>, and some <span class="strong"><strong>Tremor</strong></span>. Typically you will draw with semitransparent black or white for shading and highlights, correspondingly; you can also try barely saturated versions of complimentary colors (e.g., pale green for red background) which can often yield more “natural” results.</p><p>Of course, these layered semitransparent brush strokes need to be blurred as well. However, don’t apply blur to each stroke separately; this would be tedious to do (unlike opacity, blur is not retained in the tool’s style and therefore not applied to the next created object automatically) and slow to render. Instead, draw a single stroke, group it (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00857"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735504.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), blur the group, and then enter that group (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00858"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735510.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>). Now, each new object you create with Calligraphic pen or any other tool gets added to the blurred group and therefore is blurred along with its siblings. When you’re finished drawing within the group, leave it using <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00859"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735512.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="adding_hand-drawn_foreground_strokes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00430"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736524.png.jpg" alt="Adding hand-drawn foreground strokes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 24-18. Adding hand-drawn foreground strokes</p></div><p>Pay special attention to the edges of the objects on your “photo”—properly emphasizing these edges with dense highlights and shadows is the key to the attractive painterly look of the drawing. In particular, it’s often a good idea to use a slightly more intense highlight on the edge of a highlight and a slightly more intense shadow on the edge of a shadow.</p></div>
