- en: 'If you have a netbook or some other computer that doesn''t come with a CD drive,
    don''t worry: You can install Ubuntu using a USB flash drive. Booting from a USB
    drive can be a little more involved than simply booting from a CD or using Wubi,
    but once the installer is up and running, the installation process is identical.
    I''m going to assume that you''re using Windows for the rest of this appendix,
    but it''s possible to create a USB install disk with other operating systems too;
    see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/)
    for instructions.'

    is the case, you won't be able to use this method to install Ubuntu. Other alternative
    installation methods are available, such as downloading Wubi directly; see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/)
    for a list of options.

    the Ubuntu installer: About 2GB should do it. Make sure that you don''t have any
    files on the flash drive, either—you''ll be formatting the drive shortly, so any
    files on there will be permanently deleted.'

- en: Next, you'll need to download an Ubuntu CD image. If you're feeling clever,
    you can use your CD-burning software to make an *.iso* image from the CD provided
    with the book, but otherwise head over to [http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/),
    select your location from the drop-down list, and click **Begin Download** to
    download an Ubuntu CD image. The image is large at around 700MB, so it might take
    a while to squeeze its way down your Internet connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, large downloads don't finish properly, and you could be left with
    an incomplete CD image. An easy (but not foolproof) way to check whether the image
    downloaded correctly is to open the folder where you saved it, right-click the
    image, and select **Properties**. Check that the size of the image file is *almost*
    700MB (690MB, say).

    USB drive. Use your web browser to download the Universal USB Installer from [http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer.exe](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer.exe).

    one; otherwise, you could wipe a bunch of important files from some other disk!),
    and check the box next to it to say that you want to format the drive. Your screen
    should now look like the one in [Figure A-1](apas02.html#creating_a_bootable_usb_install_disk

    safely eject your flash drive, as you normally would.

    find out whether you're set up to boot from USB drives—if you get a purple Ubuntu
    boot screen, you're all ready to go! The rest of the process will be the same
    as the usual installation from a CD, which you can read about in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING").

- en: If the computer just boots back into Windows (or whatever operating system you're
    using), you'll need to change some settings to get it to boot from the flash drive.
    Restart the computer again, and look on the screen for text related to the boot
    order or BIOS settings for your computer. You'll normally have to press a key
    (such as **delete**, F2, or **esc**) to access these settings, but this very much
    depends on the make and model of your computer. More information on accessing
    your BIOS is given in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING").

- en: Once you've found the settings screen, find the option where you can choose
    to boot from a USB drive (that is, make the USB drive the first boot device),
    save your changes, and restart. Ideally, you'll now be taken to a purple Ubuntu
    boot screen. In that case, head over to [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. WADING
    AND DIVING"), and continue the installation as normal.
