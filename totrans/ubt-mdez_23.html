Booting from a USB drive can be a little more involved than booting from a CD or using Wubi, but once the installer is up and running, the installation process is identical. I’m going to assume that you’re using Windows for the rest of this appendix, but it’s possible to create a USB install disk with other operating systems too; see <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/</a> for instructions.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0142"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0143"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0144"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0145"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some older computers don’t have the ability to boot from USB disks. If this is the case, you won’t be able to use this method to install Ubuntu. Other alternative installation methods are available, such as downloading Wubi directly; see <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/</a> for a list of options.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Preparing the Installer Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="preparing_the_installer_files"/>Preparing the Installer Files</h1></div></div></div><p>First, you’re going to need a flash drive with sufficient capacity to hold the Ubuntu installer: About 2GB should do it. Make sure that you don’t have any files on the flash drive, either—you’ll be formatting the drive shortly, so any files on it will be permanently deleted. Next, you’ll need to download an Ubuntu CD image. If you’re feeling clever, you can use your CD-burning software to make an <span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span> image from the CD provided with the book, but otherwise head over to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/</a> and click <span class="strong"><strong>Start download</strong></span> to download an Ubuntu CD image. The image is large at around 700MB, so it might take a while to squeeze its way through your Internet connection.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0146"/></p><p>Sometimes, large downloads don’t finish properly, and you could be left with an incomplete CD image. An easy (though not foolproof) way to check whether the image downloaded correctly is to open the folder where you saved it, right-click the image, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>. Check that the size of the image file is <span class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> 700MB (690MB, say). If it’s much lower than this, it probably didn’t download properly, so you’ll have to try again.</p><p>The final thing you’ll need is the software used to put the installer onto the USB drive. Use your web browser to download the Universal USB Installer from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/</a> (click the Download link near the bottom of the page).</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Creating a Bootable Installer Disk"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="creating_a_bootable_installer_disk"/>Creating a Bootable Installer Disk</h1></div></div></div><p>With the installation files downloaded, you’ll now be able to make a bootable Ubuntu flash disk. Plug your USB drive into the computer and follow these instructions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Double-click the <span class="emphasis"><em>Universal-USB-Installer-&lt;XYZ&gt;.exe</em></span> file you just downloaded to run it (XYZ will be replaced by the current version number of the Universal USB Installer).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A License Agreement screen will appear. Click <span class="strong"><strong>I Agree</strong></span>, and you’ll be taken to the Setup Your Selections page.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Where it says <span class="emphasis"><em>Step 1</em></span>, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop</strong></span> from the list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click the Browse button under <span class="emphasis"><em>Step 2</em></span> and find the Ubuntu CD <span class="emphasis"><em>.iso</em></span> image that you downloaded earlier. Click once to select it and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Under <span class="emphasis"><em>Step 3</em></span>, select your flash drive from the list (make sure it’s the right one; otherwise, you could wipe a bunch of important files from some other disk!) and check the box next to it to say that you want to format the drive. Your screen should now look like the one in <a class="xref" href="apa.html#creating_a_bootable_usb_install_disk" title="Figure A-1. Creating a bootable USB install disk">Figure A-1</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> and wait for a few minutes while the installer is put on the disk.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once the process has finished, close the Universal USB Installer window and safely eject your flash drive, as you normally would.</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_bootable_usb_install_disk"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject_d1e25146"/><img alt="Creating a bootable USB install disk" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264098.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure A-1. Creating a bootable USB install disk</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Booting from the USB Disk"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="booting_from_the_usb_disk"/>Booting from the USB Disk</h1></div></div></div><p>Now plug the flash drive back in and restart the computer. This is where you find out whether you’re set up to boot from USB drives—if you get a purple Ubuntu boot screen, you’re all ready to go! The rest of the process will be the same as the usual installation from a CD, which you can read about in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a>. If the computer just boots back into Windows (or whatever operating system you’re using), you’ll need to change some settings to get it to boot from the flash drive. Restart the computer again and look on the screen for text related to the boot order or BIOS settings for your computer. You’ll normally have to press a key (such as <span class="keycap">delete</span>, <span class="keycap">esc</span>, or F2) to access these settings, but this very much depends on the make and model of your computer. More information on accessing your BIOS is given in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-APP-A-0147"/></p><p>Once you’ve found the settings screen, find the option that lets you choose to boot from a USB drive (that is, make the USB drive the first boot device), save your changes, and restart. Ideally, you’ll now be taken to a purple Ubuntu boot screen. In that case, head over to <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a> and continue the installation as normal.</p><p>If you run into any problems, take a look at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStickQuick/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStickQuick/</a> for hints and tips or head over to the forums (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) for advice.</p></div></div></body></html>
