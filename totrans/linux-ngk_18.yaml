    they freed people from their desks. People could do whatever they needed or wanted
    to do on their computer, wherever they wanted. As a cross-legged-on-the-floor
    kind of guy, a laptop was really great for me, as I could plop it down on the
    floor in front of the TV, and then sit there writing and gaming while playing
    my copy of *Wall Street* for the umpteenth time on the VCR. Yes, everything was
    great, but then came the Internet. Laptops suddenly became tethered to telephone
    lines and Ethernet cables.

    question of personal choice and need. For example, if you don’t have a laptop,
    there is little reason to bother, as you can’t really move a desktop computer
    around easily; and the fact that Linux support for desktop wireless hardware is
    not really ready for prime time doesn’t help matters. If, on the other hand, you
    have a laptop that you would like to use while sitting in the Santa Fe Depot in
    San Diego waiting for your train to L.A., or while sitting in your hotel room
    looking for things to do during your vacation in Seattle, or while sitting on
    your front porch taking in a bit of sun, then why not go for it? Whether you are
    ready to commit, still considering, or just plain curious, read on. . . .

    three wireless protocols commonly in use today: 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g,
    which are collectively referred to as *Wi-Fi* (short for wireless fidelity). In
    case you are wondering, a *protocol* is basically a data transmission format that
    has been generally agreed upon, in this case by the Institute of Electrical and
    Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Of these three 802.11 protocols, average home users
    need only concern themselves with 802.11b and 802.11g, as the hardware for these
    protocols is considerably less expensive than that for 802.11a, which is primarily
    used in large office environments.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The faster of the two protocols is 802.11g, which has a transmission speed of
    54 Mbps compared to the 11 Mbps speed of 802.11b. Linux support for 802.11g wireless
    cards, however, is still developmental at best, which means that for now you had
    better stick to the 11 Mbps 802.11b protocol when selecting a wireless card. Although
    this may sound like an undesirable limitation, it is pretty much irrelevant in
    the real-world scheme of things. The somewhat lower speed of the 802.11b devices
    will most likely matter very little to you unless you are forking out an awful
    lot of money to your Internet provider each month for some extreme bandwidth.
    After all, the average transmission speed of most home cable Internet connections
    is still less than the 11 Mbps speed of 802.11b, so don’t fret too much. Just
    remember that a traditional dial-up telephone modem has a transmission speed of
    56 Kbps, or 56 *thousand* bits per second; 11 Mbps is 11 *million* bits per second.
    That is plenty fast for the average mortal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason you shouldn’t feel so hampered by having to use an 802.11b wireless
    card is that the 802.11b protocol is still more commonly used than the newer 802.11g.
    Most public wireless access areas *(hot spots)*, such as airports, university
    campuses, and hotels still use the 802.11b protocol. Even if the 802.11g protocol
    is used in such places, or even if someone in your family has an 802.11g- based
    system up and running in your house, you can still connect to the Net over that
    system with your 802.11b network card, because the two protocols are compatible
    (though your 802.11b card won’t be able to use the extra speed of the 802.11g
    network).

    a pair of transceivers, communicating with each other via radio signals rather
    than over a wired connection. The WAP transmits data it receives from the Internet

    to your computer by an Ethernet cable. If you are using a cable modem, for example,

    to the wireless access point, rather than to your computer. The wireless NIC is
    connected to your computer. This is frequently a PC Card, which you plug into
    one of the PCMCIA ports on your laptop (or into a special adapter on desktops).
    The NIC and access point then communicate with each other via radio waves rather
    than a hard wire connection — a sort of virtual wire, if you like.

    you will need to get is a wireless access point. Fortunately, Linux compatibility
    is not really much of an issue in this department because the access point doesn’t
    physically interface with your computer. In addition, as your 802.11b wireless
    NIC will work with access points using either the 802.11b or 802.11g protocols,
    it doesn’t really matter what kind of wireless access point you choose. This is
    not to say that you needn’t pay attention to what you are getting, though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While whatever Wi-Fi access point you use should work right out of the box without
    the need for any special settings, there are a number of settings that you might
    want to consider specifying, especially for security reasons. For example, you
    may wish to restrict access to your wireless access point to certain hardware
    devices so that someone parked out on the street can’t access your network. Each
    piece of hardware *(node)* on a network has its own unique ID, referred to as
    a *MAC* (Media Access Control) *address*. If you want to make sure that only your
    wireless NIC can access your WAP, you can do so in your WAP settings by specifying
    your wireless card’s MAC address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can usually change the WAP settings by opening a Web browser and then punching
    up the IP address of the wireless access point, which is generally printed somewhere
    in the user’s manual. This will present you with a Web page in which you can change
    or input the various settings. As Web browsers are not native to any one system,
    changing your settings with a Linux machine is no different from changing the
    settings with a machine running another operating system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, a few WAPs require you to use Internet Explorer to handle such browser-based
    settings, and because a Linux version of Internet Explorer does not exist, you
    will find yourself stuck unless you have a Mac or Windows machine to complete
    the job. Worse yet is the fact that some WAPs do not support browser-based settings
    at all. Instead, they require you to install special Windows software to do the
    job. When selecting hardware for your wireless setup, it is obviously best to
    stay clear of this sort of WAP.

    Because these cards plug directly into your system, you must find and use a card
    that is Linux-compatible. Fedora Core comes with several wireless drivers built
    in, so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those drivers, all will
    be smooth sailing for you. Most wireless NICs are PC Cards that pop into the PCMCIA
    slot on the side of your laptop computer (see [Figure 18-3](#figure.DDU185)).

    NICs of the PC Card variety. Although there are also NICs that plug into one of
    your machine’s USB ports or PCI slots, the drivers available for such devices
    do not come with your Linux system. Therefore, I don’t really recommend using
    a non- PC-Card NIC, because adding a driver to Linux is not the simple slip-in-the-CD-
    and-double-click procedure that it can be on other systems. In fact, adding a
    driver to Linux involves mucking around with the Linux kernel itself, which is
    a cumbersome and even daunting process, especially for a beginner. Most drivers
    eventually make their way into future releases of the Linux kernel, so I strongly
    recommend sticking to hardware that is supported by the drivers included with
    your system.

    of the box,” without the need for any special drivers. I then punched up those
    devices on froogle.google.com to see what was still available (and in what price
    range). These included the Dell Truemobile 1150 ($39 to $49), the Compaq WL 110

    appear on the previous compatibility lists, performing a check with cardctl revealed
    that the card is telling my machine it is a Melco WLI-PCM-L11, which is on the

    best, though not essential, to go through the setup process in the vicinity of
    a wireless access point so that you know that you’ve succeeded. Therefore, if
    you have your own WAP at home or in the office, connect your WAP to your Internet
    source, and then turn the WAP on. If you are only going to be using public WAPs,
    perform the setup process on your next visit to Starbucks or another wireless
    hot spot.

    NIC into the PCMCIA slot on your computer. Almost immediately after doing that,
    you should hear two beeps, which tells you that all is going to be well. Any LEDs
    on the card may light up at this time. If not, they will do so after you finish
    configuring the card. If you hear only one beep after inserting the card, then
    it is most likely not compatible with any of the preinstalled drivers.
  prefs: []

- en: If your machine does not allow you to hear system beeps or other sounds for
    some reason, or if you’re just the double-checking kind, you can visually check
    to see whether or not the drivers for your card have been loaded by using the
    **lsmod** (list loaded modules) command. To do this, open a new Terminal window,
    type in /sbin/lsmod, and then press ENTER. The results should look something like
    those in [Figure 18-4](#figure.DDU186) on the next page. The driver for your card
    (**orinoco_cs** in the example) should appear near the top of the list and also
    next to **pcmcia_core**. Of course, your card may use one of the other drivers

    Configuration window. You will then be asked in another window if you want to
    save your changes (click **Yes**), and then be told that your changes have been
    saved (click **OK**). You can then close the Network Configuration window.

- en: Now that you have configured your wireless NIC, you need to activate it in order
    to use it, and there are two ways to do this. As you were warned when setting
    up the card, though, you may have to restart your computer before you can use
    your new device, so if your card doesn’t work immediately when you activate it,
    restart your computer and try again.

- en: The more traditional way of activating a wireless card is essentially a point-
    and-click approach, utilizing the Network Device Control window. To open the window,
    go to the Main menu and select **System Tools** > **Network Device Control**.
    Once the Network Device Control window opens (see [Figure 18-9](#figure.DDU191)
    on the next page), you can conveniently activate and deactivate your configured
    network devices without having to enter root mode. To activate your device, select
    it in the device list by clicking on it once and then clicking the **Activate**
    button. After a moment or two of probing (the progress of which will be shown
    in a small window), your device will be activated and that will be indicated in
    the Status column. This point-and-click approach can be used not only to activate
    and deactivate wireless devices, but wired devices as well, making it convenient
    if you use both connection methods.

    out until you hear your machine beep once, and then reinsert the card, after which
    your machine will beep twice, the LEDs on the NIC will start blinking, and all
    will be well with the world. I like to call this the *tactile approach*. It is
    quick, effective, and exceedingly straightforward. That said, it is only fair
    to point out that hardware is hardware, and as such it can wear out or become
    damaged over time, so keep that in mind if you take a shine to this manner of
    doing things. After all, some PCMCIA slots can seem a bit flimsy. Just use your
    best judgment.'

- en: While using certain wireless NICs under Linux, you may experience what seems
    like a system freeze. It doesn’t happen very often, but it usually occurs while
    some sort of Internet operation is going on, either in the background or foreground.
    I like to call this the *Wi-Fi quirkies,* though you can just call it a pain in
    the posterior if you like. You will know when the quirkies strike because you
    won’t be able to do anything, not even move your mouse.

    which I explained in the [previous section](DDU0138.html#831). Just pull your
    wireless card out of the computer for a second and — *beep* — everything will
    go back to normal. Stick the card back in to reactivate and use it, and — *beep
    beep* — you can go right back to whatever it was you were doing on the Internet.
    It’s a simple and sure-fire way of solving the problem (and it sure beats kicking
    the machine).
