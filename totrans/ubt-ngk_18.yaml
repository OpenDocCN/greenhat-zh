- en: Despite the rapidly growing popularity of Linux, it's still very much a Windows
    world. If you're anything like me, you'll often find yourself working with people
    who use Windows, so it's important to know how to make Ubuntu happily coexist
    with Microsoft's ubiquitous OS. Fortunately, Linux is just about the most accommodating
    operating system available and has no problems sharing files, reading Windows
    disks, and so forth. In fact, your Ubuntu programs probably support a wider range
    of file formats than their Windows equivalents; on more than one occasion I've
    tried to open a file in Windows, failed, and then booted into Ubuntu where I could
    open it effortlessly.
  prefs: []

- en: Of course, sharing files with others may not be your only Windows-related worry,
    especially if you're a dual-booter. Plenty of people decide to run both Windows
    and Linux on their computer, so it pays to know how you can minimize the bureaucracy
    involved in switching between the two. If you kept Windows for the sole purpose
    of running a specific application and you can't find a Linux-compatible equivalent
    to it, perhaps you can save the effort of dual-booting altogether and simply install
    the program directly onto Ubuntu. I told you Linux was accommodating . . . it'll
    even adopt Windows programs as its own!

    have a partition lurking somewhere on your hard disk filled with your Windows
    files and programs (see [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING")
    if you need a refresher on how partitions work). You can access files on Windows
    by *mounting* the partition from within Ubuntu. When you mount a partition, the
    files are made available to you through Nautilus (and other programs)—mounting
    is just Linux's way of recognizing a partition and preparing it for use.

    open a Nautilus window and click the Windows partition in the side pane.

    it is possible that you won't be sure which one your Windows partition actually
    is. Just remember that your Linux partition is represented by the hard disk icon
    named *File System*. Things aren't so simple for the Windows partition, unfortunately.
    It could be labeled *OS* (as shown in the side pane in [Figure 18-1](ch18.html#mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus
    "Figure 18-1. Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus")) or with the size of
    the partition followed by the word *Media* (for example, if your Windows partition
    is 80GB in size, it might appear as *80GB Media* in the left pane). Or, it might
    be something else entirely. Guess which one it is, if necessary—it won't hurt
    if you get it wrong.

    be safely read-write mounted in Linux, because adding new files while Windows
    is hibernated could seriously confuse it when it starts up again. To get full
    access to the drive, be sure to shut Windows down rather than hibernating.

    just found out. But what about going the other way and getting Windows to recognize
    your Linux partition? Unfortunately, Windows isn't too helpful in this respect—it
    can only view FAT or NTFS-format partitions and has no built-in support for the
    ext format normally used by Linux. As such, if you need access to your Linux files
    in Windows, it's probably easiest to create a separate FAT partition to be shared
    between both operating systems (see [Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. MANUALLY
    PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK")). Hmmm, not exactly convenient.

    that people have managed to do is to get an ext4 partition mounted in Windows

    at least you''ll be able to see what''s in there and copy them into Windows. See

- en: One of the weirder things you can do with a computer is to run a simulation
    of a computer inside it. This simulation, known as *virtual machine (VM)* software,
    allows you to install one operating system inside another, so you can run both
    at once without having to reboot. This is handy if you need to run Windows for
    some reason, perhaps for some specialized software, but are too comfortable working
    in Ubuntu to even contemplate going through the somewhat time-consuming rebooting
    procedure that dual-booters must follow to get back into Microsoft territory.
    You can even get Windows to sit there in, well, a window, which can be opened
    and closed at will just like any other program.

- en: There are some caveats. First, the virtual machine has to share your computer's
    resources with all your other programs, so it can slow things down if you're doing
    anything computationally strenuous. Second, it doesn't have the same access to
    your computer's hardware as the "real" operating system, so you probably won't
    be able to get Windows-only devices working through the virtual machine. Finally,
    and perhaps most awkwardly, you need a Windows installation CD to be able to put
    Windows into a VM, but most computers only come supplied with a recovery CD, which
    won't do the trick.

    "Figure 18-12. Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine")).
    This can be a tough decision; on one hand, you need enough memory for the "virtual"
    operating system to be able to run (Windows XP needs at least 128MB, for example),
    but you want to leave enough memory free for Ubuntu programs to be able to use
    it. VirtualBox normally suggests something sensible.

    Again, choose a size that's big enough to run the virtual OS but small enough
    that it doesn't engulf your entire hard disk.

    Internet) is to share files between computers. You might be familiar with this
    concept already; network shares are used in many workplaces, and you may have
    even set one up before on your home network. For the uninitiated, a network share
    is a folder on another computer that you can access as if it were on your own.
    Files are transferred around on the network, so there's no need to use a portable
    hard disk or flash drive to get them from one place to another.
