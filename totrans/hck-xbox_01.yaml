    that are required for some projects. Fortunately, most basic projects can be accomplished
    with only a small investment in tools, comparable to the price of one or two video

    hacking, including tools to open things up, attach and remove electronic components,
    diagnose and probe circuits, and design circuit boards. Of these tools, good quality
    versions of the first two can be purchased at fairly reasonable prices. Diagnostic
    and test tools such as oscil oscopes and logic analyzers are worth their weight
    in gold, but you’ll find that these are very heavy and they wil be a formidable
    investment. As for circuit board design tools, some of the best tools can come

    many times screws are hidden beneath the rubber feet on the bottom of equipment,
    or under a sticker label. To find screws hidden by sticker labels, firmly rub
    the surface of the label. You will feel a soft spot wherever there is a screw

    If the cover or panel flexes open around the edges or seems to have some freedom
    of movement, there may be some kind of friction lock holding the cover on. Friction
    locks are typically tab-and-slot structures, shaped so that it is much easier
    to insert the tab than to remove it. In this case, locate the tab by observing
    where the case seems to be stuck, and push in on the tab with a small flathead
    screwdriver while gently pulling up on the case. If there are multiple tabs like
    this, insert a wedge of some kind, such as another screwdriver or a paperclip,
    to prevent the tab from re-engaging as you open the other tabs.

    a low-melting-point alloy known as solder is heated and flowed around the metals
    to be joined. The solder and the metals form a local alloy. Once the joint cools,
    the components are electrically and mechanically connected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basic tools for soldering are a soldering iron, solder, flux, and desoldering
    braid. (A pair of fine-tipped tweezers is also quite handy for jobs that involve
    fine-pitch components or small parts.) A soldering iron is a hand-held tool that
    consists of a heating element and a tip; the tip is used to melt solder alloys
    through conduction or direct contact, unlike other tools that use hot gases or
    intense infra-red radiation. The kind of soldering iron tip required for optimal
    heat transfer depends upon the situation. For example, a flattened “chisel” or
    “conical chisel” tip will perform better than a simple pointed tip when soldering
    most small surface mount components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also many grades of soldering irons. The cheapest ones cost around
    ten dollars and come with large, unwieldy tips and have no temperature control;
    they just get as hot as they can. Better soldering irons cost more and have a
    sensor that actively regulates the tip’s temperature. Temperature regulation makes
    the tool’s action more consistent, and extends the life of the tip. Better irons
    also come with a wider selection of tips that may include very fine ones, suitable
    for working with the tiny components found in most electronics today. For light
    use, a quality direct-plug soldering iron with a good tip is sufficient. However,
    if you plan on building boards and really getting into hardware hacking, a hundred
    dollars for a quality temperature-controlled soldering iron such as the Weller
    WTCPT or the Weller WES50 is well worth the investment.

- en: Solders come in a wide variety. For most purposes, a eutectic Pb-Sn alloy solder
    wire with a no-clean or water-cleanable flux core is sufficient. Eutectic alloys
    are desirable because they go directly from a liquid phase to a homogenous solid.
    Kester is a major manufacturer of solders; their standard cored wire solders,
    Formula 245 and 331, are both pretty good. Formula 245 uses a no-clean flux, but
    if you like, you can use a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol to remove the
    residue. Formula 331 has a flux core that works on more materials than 245\. However,
    with 331 you need to wash down the board with water soon after soldering, or the
    flux residue will become gummy and possibly interfere with circuit operation.
    Many distributors sell Kester solder; for example, Kester 24-6337-8802 (25-gauge
    Formula 245 solder wire in a 1-lb spool) is DigiKey (www.digikey.com) part number
    KE1410-ND. The kind of solder sold at most Radio Shack’s is also quite good for
    soldering, although their solder tends to leave a sticky black residue and require
    cleanup with organic solvents.

    Solder paste can be very useful when attaching fine-pitched surface mount components.
    (See Appendix B, “Soldering Techniques,” for more information.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a solder connection is stubborn to form, flux is the panacea. Always keep
    some flux on hand. When a joint is not forming correctly, a small drop of flux
    applied directly to the joint will typically fix the problem. Flux also comes
    in a wide variety of pastes and liquids, each of which requires a different cleanup
    method. A convenient flux application solution is the flux pen, such as Kester
    83-1000-0951, a Formula 951 no-clean flux pen. You can purchase this flux pen
    from Digi-Key, part number KE1804-ND, for just a few dollars. Radio Shack also
    sells a flux paste in a tube, but their paste is messy and it requires clean-up.
    Finally, desoldering braids are useful for cleaning up any soldering messes or
    mistakes you might make. A desoldering braid is a fine braided copper wire, typically
    laced with dry flux. To use it, place it between the soldering iron and the joint
    you want to clean up; once the braid is hot, the excess solder on the joint will
    wick into the desoldering braid’s capillaries. Even though the braid may be pre-fluxed,
    applying a drop of flux to the braid prior to use still helps the process. Chemtronics
    makes a nice line of desoldering braids; an example part is Chemtronics 60-3-5
    “No-Clean Solder-Wick” (Digi-Key part number 60-3-5-ND).

    For a beginner, the basic “must-have” tool is a digital multimeter. Digital multimeters
    (DMMs) have become very featureful and affordable in the past few years; a typical
    unit will be able to measure resistance, voltage, current, capacitance, diode
    polarity and continuity, for a price of around fifty dollars. Radio Shack and
    Jameco (www.jameco.com) both carry a reasonable selection of entry-level multimeters.
    (Appendix A, “Where to Get your Hacking Gear,” has a suggestion for an entry-level
    multimeter.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For basic modification and kit-build projects, DMMs are useful for checking
    for shorted connections, and for checking the basic health of a circuit before
    and after applying power. Continuity mode in a DMM can be helpful when you feel
    like you may have messed up a solder connection. In continuity mode, the DMM will
    emit a tone whenever a low-resistance path exists between the test probes. Thus,
    the continuity feature is useful for both verifying the integrity of a solder
    joint, and for checking for shorts with adjacent connections. You should not use
    continuity mode to check for power supply shorts, because some boards will quite
    normally have a sufficiently low resistance between power and ground (ten ohms
    or so) to trigger the continuity tone. Thus, before applying power to any newly
    modified or built board, use the resistance measuring mode to check and make sure
    that there is no dead short (zero ohms of resistance) on the power lines.

    capturing the detailed shape of electrical waveforms. One can diagnose timing,
    noise and interference problems with an oscilloscope.
  prefs: []

- en: The oscilloscope’s basic defining characteristics are the number of channels
    or waveforms it can display simultaneously, and its maximum electrical bandwidth.
    High-quality oscilloscopes typically have four channels and over 500 MHz of bandwidth;
    discount or used oscilloscopes often have only two channels and somewhere between
    20 MHz and 100 MHz of usable bandwidth. The chief limitation of all oscilloscopes
    is that they can only display a short segment of an electrical waveform.

- en: Logic analyzers are useful for capturing large quantities of digital data. They
    trade off the ability to capture waveform shape for expansive data analysis and
    logging capabilities. Logic analyzers are useful for diagnosing complex digital
    busses and circuits. The basic defining characteristics of a logic analyzer are
    the number of digital channels it can sample, the maximum sampling rate, and the
    maximum sampling depth. A typical modern logic analyzer may have several dozen
    channels, a sampling rate in the hundreds of megahertz, and a sampling depth of
    a couple megabytes. Other features found in logic analyzers are programmable trigger
    algorithms and the ability to detect glitches or runt pulses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the average price of a new oscilloscope or logic analyzer runs
    in the thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. The good news is that most projects
    will not require the latest and greatest in test technology, so you can get away
    with second-hand equipment. Swapfests are great places to pick up an old scope
    or analyzer for cheap; eBay also has some good deals from time to time. If you
    have to make a choice between purchasing an oscilloscope and a logic analyzer,
    I’d recommend getting the oscilloscope first; a logic analyzer is not nearly as
    versatile as an oscilloscope, and is typically more expensive. Oscilloscopes can
    be coaxed into capturing a limited amount of logic data, whereas a logic analyzer
    can never be used to measure an analog waveform. Also, it is easier to build your
    own home-brew logic analyzer using FPGAs and custom boards than it is to build
    an oscilloscope of comparable quality. Home-brew logic analyzers can be built
    to work in high-end, high-speed applications relatively cheaply. (Chapter 8 describes
    how I built a homebrew logic analyzer to eavesdrop on a critical high-speed bus
    in the Xbox.)

    data right away. A breadboard with several bargraph LEDs wired to a set of 8-bit
    registers (part number 74HCT574) wired to shift data did the trick — all components
    that I bought at Radio Shack. The actual design is fairly simple, but because
    its use is very limited, but I’ll spare you the details. The point is that you

    called CircuitMaker2000\. While I have not used CircuitMaker2000 extensively,
    my first impression is that it is very similar to Altium’s now discontinued Protel
    99SE. Download a free 30-day demo or their free student version (with restrictions),

    it with a vendor such as Sierra Proto Express (http://www.sierraprotoexpress.com)
    for around 30 dollars per board as of this writing, with a two board minimum order.

    along the edge of the carrier. Gently work the cable free of the notch so that
    there is a couple inches of slack on the cable. Figure 1-7 illustrates about how
    much slack you should have when you are done.

    position. Lift the hard drive up and rest it over the DVD drive. With both hands,
    lift the DVD and hard drives out of the case, and fold them outward so they hang
    off to the side as shown in Figure 1-8\. The cables connecting the drives should
    fold over easily with no resistance. (Be mindful of the yellow cable coming from
    the back of the DVD drive; it can be easily pulled out of its socket if you are
    not careful.)

    is plugged in, even if the Xbox is turned off. Also note that the bottom of the
    hard drive carrier and the DVD drive have a secondary use as air ducting inside
    the Xbox. Running the Xbox with the drives off at the sides for extended periods
    of time could lead to your Xbox overheating. Likewise, be mindful of the large
    aluminum heat sinks on the CPU and the GPU. They can get unpleasantly hot — potentially
    hot enough to burn you — while the Xbox is operating.'

    that you do. This will prevent you from placing undue stresses on the cables when
    manipulating the Xbox’s case.

- en: To do so, first unplug the gray IDE ribbon cable from the Xbox motherboard.
    Next, unplug the yellow discrete wire cable connected to the DVD drive from the
    motherboard. This yellow cable carries power to the DVD and communicates information
    about the state of the DVD drive’s tray to the motherboard. Do not yank on any
    single wire in the yellow discrete wire cable, or you could unseat a wire from
    the cable head. The preferred method of removing the cable is to grip it by the
    white connector and pull; however, if your fingers are not small enough to fit
    in the tight space, you can grip the entire bundle of wire and pull gently to
    remove the connector. Set the DVD drive aside.

    is very firmly seated in the hard drive. If you simply pull on the connector directly,
    you risk injuring yourself on the sharp edges of the case when the connector comes
    free of the drive. To avoid injury, use a small flathead screwdriver to gently
    pry the connector off of the hard drive’s body, as shown in Figure 1-9.

    will still span the separate drive units; you may remove them if you wish, but
    remember its orientation so you can later re-attach the drives to the Xbox.

    to ensure that there are no loose screws or parts that you might have accidentally
    dropped into the Xbox. A loose screw will spell the end of your video game console
    and presents a potential fire hazard, so this is a worthwhile check if you have
    any doubt in your mind.

- en: The first step in reassembling your Xbox is to re-attach the disk drives. If
    you followed the procedure from the previous section, your DVD drive and your
    hard drive should already be attached by the gray IDE ribbon cable. If they are
    not, attach the end of the cable with the fewest creases to the hard drive, and
    then attach the middle connector of the cable to the DVD drive. The cables will
    only attach in one direction; pay attention to the bump on the connector and the
    position of the notch on the drive connectors.

- en: Plug the remaining free end of the gray IDE ribbon cable into the Xbox motherboard.
    The cable will only plug into the motherboard in one direction; note the bump
    in the middle of the IDE plug and the notch on the motherboard receptacle. Now,
    attach the yellow DVD cable to the Xbox motherboard. This cable also will plug
    into the motherboard connector in only one orientation, and it too has bumps on
    the cable and corresponding notches on the motherboard receptacle. Now, set the
    DVD drive into the Xbox. Check that it is flush and level by observing how the
    Xbox-logo DVD drive tray sits with respect to the edge of the case. It is likely
    that you will need to try to place the drive a couple of times before it sits
    just right. Use the creases in the gray IDE ribbon cable to help guide you if
    you are confused about the orientation of the various parts.

- en: You’re almost done. Drop the hard drive into place next to the DVD drive. Again,
    this drive will probably require a bit of jiggling about in order to get it to
    settle into place. The drive should be level with the DVD drive and flush with
    the edges of the metal EMI radiation shieldaround the Xbox case. Thread the hard
    drive power cable through its retaining notch in the drive tray, and plug it into
    the hard drive. You will need to apply a fair bit of force on the connector to
    create a solid connection; you should feel a gentle snap when the connector is
    fully engaged. Finally, thread the gray IDE ribbon cable through its original
    retaining hook on the drive carriers.

    check to make sure that the Xbox starts up properly. You can run the Xbox indefinitely
    with the cover off like this, as all of the cooling ducts formed by the bottom
    of the drive carriers and the DVD drive are in place. If the drives are not properly
    connected to the Xbox, the console will still boot, but it wil display a message
    that your console requires service. Check your connections carefully if this message
    appears.

    this point: three short T10-drive screws for the drive carriers, and six long
    T20-drive screws for the case cover. Don’t panic if you are missing a couple of
    screws, or if you have a couple extra. The Xbox will still hold together even
    if you’re short a screw or two. Attach the screws and the case cover in the reverse
    order of removing them. (See the pictures earlier in this section if you need
    a reminder as to where they go.)'
