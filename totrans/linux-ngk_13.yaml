    rock. You already learned about the GNOME CD Player in [Chapter 7](DDU0055_split_000.html#309),
    but in this chapter you will find out even more about your system’s musical talents.
    You will learn how to rip CDs and create MP3 and Ogg files (which have the .mp3
    and .ogg filename extensions), how to change the tags of such files, and how to
    play those files. You’ll also learn how to play a variety of audio streams.

    in which audio data can be stored on your computer. The de facto standards for

    AU

- en: (from Sun/Unix, and using the .au extension), and AIFF (from Apple), all of
    which are uncompressed formats. Files saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly
    large, with an average WAV file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB
    per minute. To put that in perspective, my first Macintosh back in 1988 had a
    40MB hard disk — more space than I would ever need, I thought at the time, but
    not enough to store a WAV file of Nirvana’s “Come as You Are.”

- en: As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they are
    today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about those
    disk-space devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus developed.
    These compression formats worked, to oversimplify things a bit, by cutting out
    the portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear — sort of a dog-whistle
    approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio compression formats
    is MP3\. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth
    the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another audio-compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. Ogg Vorbis
    was a product of the open source community, and so, unlike MP3, which has always
    been used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, was free of patent
    and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of that, and the fact that it was
    the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not better), Ogg Vorbis
    became the darling of the Linux community, and its de facto audio compression
    format.

    Grip allows you to *rip* (copy) WAV files from audio CDs and save those files

    ping the CD and then encoding its files in the Ogg file format is quite simple.
    Grip, as configured in Fedora, is already set up to do it quite well. To start,
    just place the audio CD you want to rip in your drive. The GNOME CD Player will
    then automatically start, but you don’t need it for this ripping endeavor, so
    you can close it. Then, go to the Main menu and select **Sound** & **Video** >
    **More Sound** & **Video Applications** > **Grip**.

    titles of all of the songs on the CD (see [Figure 13-1](#figure.DDU121)).

    If you didn’t create an ogg folder when doing the projects in [Chapter 5](DDU0040_split_000.html#213),
    Grip will have automatically created one for you. If you clicked the **Rip + Encode**
    button to encode your files in the Ogg format, Grip will also have deleted the
    space-wasting WAV files that it ripped from the CD.

    will be a folder for the album inside the newly created artist folder, and the
    ripped (and possibly encoded) files will be within the album folder. Thus, if
    you ripped a CD called *Orange Lightning Water* by Chuck Rumsfoord and the Venutians,
    you would find your files in ogg/chuck_rumsfoord_and_the_venutians/orange_ lightning_water.
    Grip will also create an M3U playlist for the album outside of the artist folder
    (with an .m3u filename extension). Double-clicking that file will start up your
    default audio player, which will load the entire song list for that album and
    then start playing it all. Very handy.

- en: One of the coolest features of the Internet is streaming media, which is essentially
    live or taped audio or video Internet broadcasts. Such broadcasts can come in
    a variety of streaming formats, which are basically compression formats that allow
    data to move across the Net at as small a size as possible. Unfortunately, Linux
    cannot yet deal with the two most common of these formats, Microsoft’s Windows
    Media Player and Apple’s QuickTime, at least not in any simple way. Fortunately
    there are other media streaming formats out there on the Net, such as RealMedia.
    In addition, as streaming media formats are essentially space- saving compression
    formats, it is only natural that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, both audio compression formats
    themselves, have also come to be used as streaming media formats for Internet
    audio broadcasts.

    Ogg Vorbis is also used for streaming media across the Internet. Compared to the
    number of MP3 streams, however, the number of Ogg Vorbis broadcast streams is
    still rather limited. Things seem to be changing, though, and the number of Internet
    broadcasters who are experimenting with Ogg Vorbis seems to be increasing, albeit
    very slowly.

    France has a number of program streams for Internet listeners in Windows Media
    Player format. It also has now begun to “expérimente” (its word, not mine) with
    providing Ogg Vorbis streams for all of their broadcast programs. The stream I
    recommend you try out is Fip, which is an exceedingly cool eclectic collection
    of music of *all* genres; you will be constantly surprised by what they play.
    If you are worried about language, don’t; there is very little talk, and roughly
    80 percent of the music played is in English. I don’t speak any French other than
    *je suis fatigué*, but I have no problems at all.

    look of your system by changing window border and application control themes.
    However, XMMS is configured to hide its window bars, and it uses controls of its
    own, so any cosmetic changes you make to your system will have no effect on XMMS.
    You can, however, directly change the look of XMMS by using its own themes, called
    *skins*. The default skin for XMMS in Fedora Core is called Bluecurve, and it
    essentially follows the default theme of the rest of the system.
  prefs: []

    This is easily enough done by running Synaptic, typing xmms-skins in Synaptic’s
    **Find** box, and then following the usual Synaptic download/installation steps.
    Once done, you will have a hefty collection of XMMS skins to work with. If you
    installed your Fedora Core or Red Hat Linux system from a 3-CD installation disk
    set, the xmms-skins package is already included on the disks, so you can install
    the skins by using the Package Management window instead. Just click the **Details**

    to consider. You may agree that the Ultrafina skin looks much more handsome than
    the default Bluecurve skin when the components are stacked on top of one another,
    as in [Figure 13-15](#figure.DDU135) on the previous page. However, place the

    Just click the word **Proxy** at the left side of the window, and then input your
    settings on the right side of the window where it says Manually Configure HTTP
    Proxy. Once you’re done, click **OK**, or press ENTER if that doesn’t work.

- en: The RealOne Player is now installed and set up on your machine, but in order
    to use it comfortably, it is probably best to set your Mozilla Web browser so
    that it will know what to do when you try to play a RealMedia stream. The easiest
    way to do this is by trying to open a stream straightaway. For convenience’s sake,
    I will use the National Public Radio site ([www.npr.org](http://www.npr.org))
    as my source stream; you can, of course, choose any stream you like. If you don’t
    know any streams offhand, just follow along with me. It doesn’t really matter
    at this point, because our objective is merely to set up Mozilla.

    of NPR, you will first be asked if you want to use Real Player or Windows Media
    Player. Click **Real Player**. After doing this, Mozilla will pop up yet another
    what-should-I-do-with-this-file window, asking you what to do with the stream.
    Check the radio button next to the **Open with** box, and type /home/*username*/RealPlayer9/realplay
    (replacing *username* with your own username, of course). Once you’ve done that,
    click **OK**, and the stream should begin playing after a few seconds of pre-buffering.
    The station icon for that stream, if there is one, will also appear in the RealOne
    Player window.

    what to do with RealMedia streams. If you do happen to get asked again somewhere
    along the way, follow the same steps again: Select **Open with**, type /home/username/RealPlayer9/realplay,
    and click **OK**.'

    right away. There are plenty of sites out there with RealMedia streams, but let
    me steer you to some of my faves to get you started (you may already know some
    of these):'
