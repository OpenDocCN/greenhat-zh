    a peak pulse capability of 160 watts for less than 10 seconds. Microsoft buys
    this power supply from multiple vendors, including Delta Electronics, Inc. (www.deltaww.com).
    Delta’s is used in United States Xboxes, and you can find a datasheet for this
    part through their website or through a web search.

    signals show no obvious or recognizable signal patterns when probed, and because
    multiple display modes are supported by a single connector. There are a few websites
    that post pinouts for the video connector, but crosschecking the posted information
    with measurements reveals some discrepancies. I have done my best here to piece
    together and reconcile two separate postings from the XboxHacker BBS and the ucon64
    web page at Sourceforge.net. The original postings can be found at http://www.xboxhacker.net/index.php?do=article&id=10&page=1
    and at http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/ucon64misc/conn.html. The definition of all
    eight video modes selectable by the MODE1-3 signals is listed on the XboxHacker
    BBS web page. My measurements indicate that all of the composite video and audio
    signal mappings are correct, but I was unable to verify the SDTV, HDTV, and RGB
    mappings as given by the Xboxhacker BBS posting. I apologize in advance if any
    of these signals are incorrect.

    that they are used to supply power to peripherals attached to the video connector
    during hot-insertion events. The longer pins allow a peripheral’s circuitry to
    power up before receiving signals in the event that the peripheral is connected
    while the Xbox is powered on. This helps prevent a potentially destructive situation
    inside the peripheral’s chips called *latch-up*.

- en: The pin numbering used by Table F-3 for the Xbox video connector is illustrated
    in Figure F-1\. Both the Xboxhacker-derived pinout and the ucon64-derived pinouts
    disagree in terms of their numbering scheme, so I chose a number scheme that is
    somewhere in between the two. Interestingly, pin 24 in Figure F-1 is mapped to
    a square pad on the Xbox video connector, indicating that the numbering scheme
    I chose to give the connector here is not consistent with the manufacturer’s numbering
    scheme (square pads typically indicate pin 1, while round pads indicate all other
    pins). This should not effect the correctness of the table, as pin numbering schemes
    are arbitrary and only need to be consistent with the pin definition table.

    This bus was originally defined by Intel for use with Southbridge chipsets to
    reduce pin count, thus saving on cost, while maintaining support for legacy PC
    I/O functions. These legacy I/O functions used to sit on the nearly extinct ISA
    bus, and they include the keyboard, mouse, serial port, paral el port, and boot
    ROM. Intel’s specification for the LPC bus can be found at http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/industry/25128901.pdf.

    LPC Debug Module Design Guide by Intel, http://www.intel.com/technology/easeofuse/LPC_mod_spec72.pdf,
    with some minor modifications as noted in Table F-7\. In particular, the function
    of pin 16 is unclear, as its companion pin 15 was re-assigned to be a power pin
    on the Xbox motherboard. The allocation of pin 15 as a power pin is deduced by
    the fat trace and nearby decoupling capacitor allocated to the pin. If pin 15
    were intended for use as a permanently high SPDA1 signal, then a narrower trace
    without the power conditioning would have been used.
