- en: Any way you look at it, the Web has changed the world of graphic design. In
    the earliest days of the Internet, content was king, plain old HTML got the job
    done, and website design was, at best, a hack. These days, the best website designs
    utilize *Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)*. CSS is an established style sheet language
    that separates layout from content. This separation allows the designer to create
    visual consistency while somebody else works to create compelling content. CSS
    designs also make effective use of graphics, and that’s where GIMP comes in. It
    provides designers with the raster images required by the Web.

    view, has been its static nature. Animated GIF images were an early hack, but
    they didn’t provide real interactivity. Today, Adobe Flash works well with raster
    images, but it also offers web designers a wealth of vector support. GIMP isn’t
    the best tool for vector work, but if your web designs use raster images, Flash
    and GIMP make a great team.

    your desktop (72 ppi for most CRT displays or 98 ppi for LCD displays) will also
    be the image resolution of the medium. That means the images created in this chapter
    won’t need to be re-created at larger sizes. In fact, some will probably need
    to be scaled down (or re-created at a smaller scale) to be useful on the Web.

- en: Most web pages are made up of text and images. The text is often composed in
    WordPad, OpenOffice.org Writer, or vi, and web developers assume that the reader’s
    browser will have access to the fonts required to display the text. The web designer
    can request a particular font, but if the browser doesn’t have it, the browser
    gets to choose which font it will use instead. Because the various desktop platforms
    (Windows, Mac, and UNIX/Linux) don’t all have the same fonts, you can’t guarantee
    readers will see your web pages exactly the way you do. In short, because the
    Web still doesn’t support cross-platform font management very well, you can never
    be 100 percent certain that the font you request will be available on the system
    running the web browser.

    Using the GIMP to render text into an image guarantees that everyone who sees
    the image will see it as you do. This little trick is only suitable for titles
    and small captions, however. It makes little sense to render entire paragraphs
    into an image because image files are much larger than text files, and editing
    the text would require working with graphics programs that aren’t as well suited
    to text editing as HTML editors. Despite this, it’s quite common to render text
    for headers, buttons, and title bars into images in order to guarantee that those
    elements will look the way the designer wants them to look.

    sense in every design. Rectangular buttons are popular because they can be changed
    easily without having to worry about how they blend into background pages. Gel
    buttons, on the other hand, generally require a lot of page space. Their nonrectangular
    shape also requires antialiasing the background color and makes it difficult to
    switch the background on a whim. Despite these shortcomings, many clients want
    websites with gel buttons.

    applied to text. Here you’ll see a more general version of the process, but the
    possibilities are endless. It’s not hard to imagine extending this effect to an
    oozing tube of toothpaste, for example. Just cycle the results through a wave
    filter.

    sides straight. For an oval selection, imagine the selection is tied to the sides
    of a box bounding the selection. When the bounding box is stretched, the oval
    selection is stretched to keep it proportionally distanced from the sides of the
    bounding box. In this case you’ll be transforming the layer itself, not a selection,

    reflects unevenly off of most surfaces.) The next step is to add some variance

    the banner at the top of the page, slide show images, and extras such as backgrounds

    Cafepress.com, a site for creating custom prints on a variety of products, suggests
    a maximum of 500 × 200 pixels. WordPress, an open source package for blogging
    and content management, provides a default theme that supports a maximum size
    of 940 × 198 pixels. Since it’s impossible to know what size display resolutions
    your visitors will have, it’s often wisest to keep the width under 1024 pixels.

    A low-contrast image might look good on a designer’s high-end display, but you
    can’t guarantee that all visitors to the website will see the image in the same
    way. Adding a drop shadow or outline can help separate the text from the background.

    not every format works well in every situation. If you have solid text in an image

    color information, the GIF format works well for images that have only a few colors
    (256 or less) and strong contrast (like black text on a white background). The
    GIF format also provides *lossless compression*, which means it compresses the

    for photographs based on how the human eye perceives color. Using 24 bits (three
    8-bit RGB channels) to represent each pixel, the JPEG format easily handles up
    to 16 million colors. Unlike the GIF format, the JPEG format’s compression is
    described as *lossy*, which means (theoretically, at least) that by using it you’re
    throwing away data. The actual data loss is usually trivial, however, and you
    can specify how much to compress an image, depending on the degree of quality
    loss you’re willing to accept. A bigger disadvantage for some GIMP artists may
    be that the JPEG format doesn’t handle transparency information. The GIF format
    does, but it can only interpret transparency as on or off for any given pixel,
    leading to “stairsteps” in nonrectangular regions of your image.

    and millions of colors. It also offers *lossless compression*, so no data is sacrificed.
    Not all browsers fully support the PNG format, though modern browsers, such as
    those provided with Windows Vista, Mac OS X, and any recent Linux distribution,
    should have no problem. For example, some older versions of Internet Explorer
    can’t display PNG images if they contain transparency information. If only all

    programs to handle various file types. Designers or photographers who provide
    sample hi-res copies of their work in private web galleries may choose this option.
    Full-color TIFF images might be appropriate in such a case, though thumbnail previews
    would still need to be GIF, JPEG, or PNG files because they would be displayed
    by the browser.
