- en: Over the years system installers have developed many different ways to string
    cables above false ceilings. One of the more innovative is the "small dog" method.
    One person takes a small dog, ties a string to its collar, and puts the dog in
    the ceiling. The owner then goes to the spot where they want the cable to come
    out and calls the dog. Dog runs to owner. They attach a cable to the string and
    pull it through, and the cable is installed.
