  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, this is a book about Inkscape, a powerful open source SVG-based vector
    graphics editor. It describes the stable version 0.47 (released in summer 2009)
    in great detail, covering all of its features (excluding only a few that are clearly
    experimental or incomplete).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second, perhaps more ambitious goal of this book is to evangelize the vector
    way of creating graphics and share the joy of thinking in vector. Once the exclusive
    domain of professional designers, in the recent years vector graphics software
    has grown much more visible and accessible. A vector editor is not yet a standard
    accessory of a computer in the same way a bitmap editor like Photoshop is, but
    it’s getting there—and Inkscape has been a major part of this “vector revolution.”

- en: Much of Inkscape’s appeal lies in its being the only professional-level vector
    editor which is fully open source and cross-platform. There’s more to it than
    that, however. Simple and accessible at the basic level, Inkscape is also extremely
    powerful if you dig deeper; it is vast and inexhaustibly hackable—from customizable
    keyboard shortcuts ([Appendix D](apd.html "Appendix D. Keyboard Shortcuts")) and
    a command-line language ([Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. The Command Line")),
    to powerful chainable path effects ([Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Path Effects
    and Extensions")), to arbitrarily complex vector filters that push the envelope
    of vector graphics ([Chapter 17](ch17.html "Chapter 17. Filters")). This book
    swims the Inkscape ocean from shore to shore without leaving any island unvisited.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Inkscape and the World") is a high-level
    description of Inkscape, its capabilities, and its place in the world of vector
    graphics (and, to some extent, computer graphics in general). Next, [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. An Inkscape Primer") gives an absolutely down-to-the-basics primer
    on the first steps in the program (installation, opening, creating objects, transforming
    them, saving); you can safely skip this chapter if you have ever completed even
    a small Inkscape project.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bulk of the book, Chapters **3** to **18**, is written to be read more or
    less in sequence. These chapters present all aspects of Inkscape functionality
    (objects, transformations, style, paths, text, and so on) with detailed explanations,
    illustrations, and practical tips.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The second part of the book (starting from [Chapter 19](ch19.html "Chapter 19. Tutorial:
    Designing a Business Card")) contains several complete step-by-step tutorials
    demonstrating real-world uses of Inkscape (such as an animation, a business card,
    and the cover illustration for this book). The book ends with several appendices
    ([Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. An SVG Primer")) with reference information,
    including a complete list of keyboard and mouse shortcuts.'

- en: Inkscape is a work in progress. So is this book. New stable versions of Inkscape
    are released approximately once a year, and I will try to keep this book up to
    date. For the latest updates, visit *[http://www.nostarch.com/inkscape.htm](http://www.nostarch.com/inkscape.htm)*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t need to be a graphics professional to find this book useful. Even
    if you are entirely new to vector editors, this book should be a gentle enough
    introduction to get you started on your vector graphics journey. You will have
    some new concepts to grasp and some terminology to learn, but that should come
    naturally if you practice what you learn. As you read, I’d recommend that you
    run Inkscape and immediately try the techniques described in this book.

- en: On the other hand, even an experienced user of Inkscape or another vector graphics
    program should find enough to chew on in this book. I am writing from two perspectives—that
    of a user of Inkscape and that of a developer, and I hope my experience of contributing
    to the Inkscape project allows me to more clearly see the logic of the program’s
    interface and behavior, to identify its particularly strong and weak points (and
    to suggest workarounds for the weak points).
