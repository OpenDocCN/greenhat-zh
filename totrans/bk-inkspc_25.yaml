- en: This appendix is a very high-level glance at the general principles of SVG and
    its implementation in Inkscape. Some of this material has already been referred
    to in other chapters. However, this book does not intend to replace the official
    SVG specification. If you want an absolutely final, complete, and authoritative
    reference on SVG, you need the SVG specification produced by the W3C. Available
    versions of this specification can be found at *[http://w3.org/Graphics/SVG](http://w3.org/Graphics/SVG)*;
    the version that Inkscape currently supports, 1.1, is at *[http://w3.org/TR/SVG11](http://w3.org/TR/SVG11)*.

- en: Knowledge of SVG and, more generally, XML (SVG is just a specialized variety
    of XML) is not *strictly* necessary for mastering Inkscape—but it really helps.
    It will allow you to peek under the hood of Inkscape drawings, and it will often
    reveal the true reasons behind some of Inkscape’s features (or lack thereof).
    As XML is so widely used these days, this appendix’s material may also be useful
    to you in a lot of other situations not involving Inkscape and SVG at all.

    has used it, though often unknowingly. If you’ve seen the source code of a web
    page, you already know what XML looks like, because XHTML, the markup language
    used on the Web today, is one of the subspecies of XML (more precisely, an *XML
    vocabulary*). SVG is another such vocabulary.

    biggest advantage is that it is easy to parse for computers and yet quite understandable
    for humans. Unlike most other computer-related concepts that are, usually, as
    complex as you think they are (or more), XML is an unbelievably simple thing.
    So simple, in fact, that I will now explain it in a few short paragraphs.

    except that the closing one has a forward slash (`/`) before the element name,
    which in this case is `example`.

    reasons, only uses the second one, with a single `style` attribute. When both
    are present, the properties in the `style` attribute take precedence over the
    same properties in presentation attributes.

- en: SVG prescribes that most (but not all) style properties should be inherited
    by children from their parents, provided a child does not specify its own value
    for that property. For example, if a rectangle has no `fill` property specified
    but its parent `g` has `fill="blue"`, the rectangle will be painted blue. In Inkscape,
    such inheritance rarely plays a role, simply because normally, objects have most
    of their properties set whether you changed them or not. However, for `fill` and
    `stroke` properties, there’s a way to remove, or *unset*, these properties using
    the UI, making it possible to inherit these properties from the parent element
    (**[8.1.1 Paint](ch08s01.html#eightdot1dot1_paint "8.1.1 Paint")**).

- en: Often, elements in SVG need to refer, or *link*, to one another. This is most
    common when visible elements on canvas use some of the definitions in `defs`.
    For example, if you have a rectangle filled with linear gradient, the `rect` element
    describes only the rectangle itself. Its gradient is described by a different
    element, called `linearGradient`, in the document’s `defs`, and the rectangle
    links to that gradient definition.

    is unique inside this document. Inkscape provides unique `id`s for all elements
    automatically. The URL for linking to an element is simply its `id` preceded by
    a hash mark (`#`)—for example, `#linearGradient2128`. In order to use this URL
    from a `style` property, you need to enclose it in parentheses and prefix it with
    the string `url`. For example, here’s a `linearGradient` element and a rectangle
    linking to it from its `fill` property:'

- en: Linking is not always done by style properties; for example, the SVG standard
    says that gradients can link to one another in order to share color stops and
    other attributes. In such cases, the `xlink:href` attribute is used (in other
    words, the `href` attribute in the XLink namespace). (XLink is another W3C standard,
    separate from SVG and used in many XML vocabularies for linking; see *[http://w3.org/TR/xlink](http://w3.org/TR/xlink)*
    for the specification.) The `xlink:href` attribute uses the plain URL without
    the `url()` wrapper; for example, `xlink:href="#linearGradient2128"`.

    to other documents, accessible locally or on the Internet, as well as to elements
    inside them. As of version 0.47, Inkscape does not yet support such cross-document
    linking to SVG documents, although it can link to external bitmap files that are
    used as bitmap objects in a document.

- en: One of the most important features of Inkscape is its ability to create various
    object types, with each object remembering its type and providing various controls
    and behaviors specific to that type ([Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Shapes")).
    Some of these object types are directly supported by SVG; for example, Inkscape’s
    rectangles are represented by `rect` elements from SVG. But others are unique
    to Inkscape; for example, SVG has no special elements for spirals, stars, or 3D
    boxes. How can Inkscape use these object types while staying compatible with standard
    SVG?

    universal `path` element that can represent any shape, but adds to it the `sodipodi:type`
    indicating it’s actually a star, as well as some other extension attributes storing
    various star-specific parameters. The `path`’s standard `d` attribute, meanwhile,
    provides an exact representation of the star’s shape:'

- en: When loading a document with such an element, Inkscape recognizes the `sodipodi:type`
    and, for editing, treats the object as a star rather than a path. However, when
    any other SVG software loads the same file, it ignores any Inkscape-specific attributes
    and interprets this element as a simple path which, however, *looks* exactly the
    same as the star created in Inkscape. In other words, while only Inkscape can
    *edit* the star as a star, using the standard `path` as the base for this object
    type ensures that it remains compatible with any SVG software.

    make Inkscape documents invalid SVG. The X in [XML](ch04s05.html#ch04note07 "XML")
    stands for “eXtensible” for a reason: The ability to freely mix different vocabularies
    was one of the goals of XML from the very beginning. In our case, this means that
    any Inkscape SVG file must—and does—render absolutely the same in all compliant
    SVG renderers. (There’s a single unfortunate exception from this rule, which we
    discuss in **[15.2.2.3 SVG Compatibility](ch15s02.html#one5dot2dot2dot3_svg_compatibility
    "15.2.2.3 SVG Compatibility")**.)'

    types (**[A.10 Object Types](apas10.html "A.10 Object Types")**). An element with
    this attribute usually has a whole bunch of other Inkscape-specific attributes
    that store various parameters unique to this object type.

    are set on an object if you dragged its rotation center (**[6.4 Center of Rotation](ch06s04.html

    each object for which it was changed.

    nodes of a path that you edited with the Node tool. Classifying nodes as smooth,
    symmetric, and cusp (**[12.5.5 Node Types](ch12s05.html#one2dot5dot5_node_types

    provisions for; hence the need for an extension attribute.

    a layer in Inkscape (**[A.5 Layers and Groups](apas05.html "A.5 Layers and Groups")**).

    label for the corresponding object (the problem with using the `id` attribute
    for that purpose is that it cannot contain spaces and punctuation; `inkscape:label`
    is free from these limitations, **[4.1 Object Properties](ch04s01.html "4.1 Object
    Properties")**). In this attribute, Inkscape stores the human-readable name of
    a layer.

    the filename (including path) into which this object was last exported as bitmap.

    Bitmap** dialog (**[18.9.1 The Export Bitmap Dialog](ch18s09.html#one8dot9dot1_the_export_bitmap_dialog
    "18.9.1 The Export Bitmap Dialog")**), so you can quickly repeat exporting to
    the same file even after you closed and reopened the file. (This also explains
    why Inkscape claims that the file has changed and needs resaving after you did
    a bitmap export from it.)
