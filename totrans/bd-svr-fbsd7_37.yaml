- en: NTP (Network Time Protocol) is an Internet protocol used for synchronizing the
    clocks of networked computers. Computer clock accuracy is instrumental in providing
    a consistent reference for system log files, email timestamps, time-activated
    scripts, and so on. The NTP system is capable of keeping your computer's clock
    accurate to within a few milliseconds of an accurate time server. Time servers
    are usually connected directly to a source of accurate time (e.g., atomic or GPS
    clocks).

- en: The NTP system consists of a hierarchy, or strata, of public and private servers.
    A stratum 1 server synchronizes its clock with an accurate external GPS (Global
    Positioning System) clock, radio clock, or other highly accurate time-keeping
    device. A stratum 2 server derives its clock data from one or more stratum 1 servers,
    a stratum 3 server derives its clock data from one or more stratum 2 servers,
    and so on. Servers at the lower stratum levels (numerically speaking) are not
    necessarily more accurate. The accuracy of the time source, geographic location,
    and network latency all contribute to the accuracy of a time server.

- en: A server running the NTP daemon periodically synchronizes its clock to one or
    more established time servers. Over time, the NTP daemon calculates the system-specific
    clock error. If the system temporarily loses Internet connectivity, the NTP daemon
    will keep the system clock accurate using this error (or clock drift) data until
    it can re-synchronize with a time server.

- en: David Mills, a professor at the University of Delaware, originally developed
    NTP in the early '80s. NTP was initially named the Internet Clock Service and
    was created to provide clock synchronization for the HELLO routing protocol. These
    early versions of NTP were less accurate than today's because they did not have
    any frequency correction abilities. Mills, along with a team of volunteers, continues
    to develop NTP.
