The techniques outlined in this book can be—and have been—used for both "good" and "evil." Regardless, I hope this book has inspired you to do some kernel hacking of your own, whether it be writing a rootkit, writing a device driver, or just parsing through the kernel source.</p><p>Before wrapping up, three additional points are worth mentioning. First, unless you are writing a rootkit for educational purposes, you should try to keep it as simple as possible; being fancy, only introduces errors. Second, like writing any piece of kernel code, be mindful of concurrency issues (both uniprocessor and SMP), race conditions, and how you transition between kernel and user space; or else, be prepared for a kernel panic. Finally, remember that you only need to find a handful of reliable, unguarded locations in order for your rootkit to be successful, while the anti-rootkit crowd needs to defend, more or less, the entire kernel—and the kernel is a very big place.</p><p>Happy hacking!</p></div></body></html>
