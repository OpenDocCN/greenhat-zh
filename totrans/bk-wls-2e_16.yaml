- en: For more than a century, a dedicated collection of cables, switches, and radio
    links known as the *public switched telephone network (PSTN)* has connected the
    world's telephones. When you place a telephone call, the PSTN creates a direct
    link between your phone and the phone assigned to the unique telephone number
    you requested. The telephone industry calls this kind of basic connection POTS
    (plain old telephone service, pronounced like *pots* and pans). The Internet is
    a separate system that uses a different set of rules and methods to connect computers
    to one another. Computer data (including digital audio) does not require a continuous
    connection, so Internet connections can use packet switching (as described in
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKING")) to move data more
    quickly and more efficiently than the older PSTN.

- en: When you connect a telephone or a microphone to a computer and convert the sound
    of your voice to a sequence of digital packets, you can send those packets through
    the Internet to a specific destination, where the recipient's computer converts
    the packets back into an analog audio stream and plays the audio through a speaker
    or a telephone handset. The technology that moves voice communication through
    the Internet is known as *VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)*.

- en: If the recipient of your call has a computer connected to the Internet, you
    can completely bypass the PSTN and route the call through the Internet, using
    the recipient's Internet address to identify the call's destination. But it's
    also possible to transfer a call between the Internet and the PSTN in either direction.
    You can originate a call on the Internet and direct it to the PSTN, or you can
    use your POTS line to call a phone attached to a computer.

- en: VoIP offers several possible advantages over calling through the traditional
    telephone system. First, it's often significantly cheaper because there are no
    toll charges for long distance calls. Second, in places where telephone service
    is not reliable, the Internet's error-correcting packet data switching can sometimes
    provide connections with better sound and fewer dropped calls than a bad telephone
    line (but the emphasis is on *sometimes*—just as often, a POTS call will be clearer
    than VoIP). And third, it's possible to use VoIP through a Wi-Fi or broadband
    wireless link in places where a conventional telephone line or mobile telephone
    signal might not be available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, VoIP is often less reliable and less consistent than the
    PSTN because VoIP packets (and other live audio or video streams) can be interrupted
    or delayed by all the sources of interference and noise that other data ignores.
    It makes no difference if your email message takes several minutes to arrive,
    but you expect a phone call to reach its recipient *right now*. And the sound
    quality of VoIP calls can sometimes be noticeably worse than a call through the
    PSTN. In practice, the reduced cost of long distance calls is generally the most
    compelling reason to use VoIP.

    that use VoIP instead of the old PSTN. Some are marketed as alternatives to the
    local dial tone company, others are low-cost worldwide long distance services,
    and still others offer a local telephone number in one or more distant locations,
    so people who call you don't have to pay long distance charges. You can find directories
    and user reviews of VoIP services at several websites, including [http://www.voipreview.org](http://www.voipreview.org),

    fails, you won''t be able to use your VoIP telephone, but a conventional telephone
    will probably continue to work. And VoIP networks create special challenges when
    you call 911 (or the comparable telephone number in your country) in an emergency
    because a VoIP call to 911 might not connect you to the nearest Public Safety
    Answering Point (PSAP), or if it does, it might not accurately transmit your telephone
    number and address to the PSAP operator*.'

    telephone number from your VoIP service provider's website and follow their instructions
    for setting up an inbound account. A VoIP telephone number is just like any other
    phone number, so anybody with a telephone can use that number to call you. Most
    service providers either charge a flat rate for unlimited inbound calls, or they
    charge a few pennies per minute or per call.

    a local call. For example, if you live in California, and you have family in Hong
    Kong, England, and Canada, you could choose local telephone numbers for your VoIP
    account based in Hong Kong, London, and Vancouver and allow your relatives to
    reach you without the need to place expensive international long distance calls.

    VoWiFi telephone must either support SIP or connect to a computer or router that
    supports SIP. A VoWiFi telephone call uses SIP to control a wireless telephone
    that sends and receives calls through a Wi-Fi base station that is connected to
    the Internet. Among other things, the SIP configuration settings specify the IP
    address of your VoIP service provider and the telephone number assigned to your
