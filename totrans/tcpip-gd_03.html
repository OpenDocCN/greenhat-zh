Now we can begin to turn our attention to the main subject of this book: TCP/IP. Just as Ethernet rules the roost when it comes to local area network (LAN) technologies, and IEEE 802.11 is the boss of the wireless LAN (WLAN) world, TCP/IP dominates and even defines the world of modern internetworking, including the Internet.</p><p>Since TCP/IP is the subject of this entire book, you might be wondering why this part is so small, containing only a single chapter. The reason is that it provides only a high-level overview of the TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP/IP is a collection of several dozen constituent protocols and technologies. These are described in the following two sections of the book, which cover lower-layer and application protocols, respectively. These protocols are summarized in the TCP/IP introduction chapter that follows, which also provides a brief history of TCP/IP and describes its services and model.</p></div></div>

In that time, it has evolved from an experimental technology that was used to hook together a handful of research computers to the powerhouse of the largest and most complex computer network in history: the global Internet, connecting together millions of networks and end devices.</p><p>In this chapter, we begin a magical tour through the mystical world of TCP/IP with an overview and a brief look at its very interesting history. I discuss the services provided in TCP/IP networks and then explain the architectural model used under TCP/IP. I then provide a brief description of each of the most important TCP/IP protocols that are discussed in the remainder of the book.</p><div class="sect1" title="TCP/IP Overview and History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tcpip_overview_and_history"/>TCP/IP Overview and History</h1></div></div></div><p>The best place to begin an examination of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0392"/>TCP/IP is probably with the name itself. In fact, TCP/IP consists of dozens of different protocols, of which two are usually considered the most important. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Protocol (IP)</em></span> is the primary OSI model network layer (layer 3) protocol that provides addressing, datagram routing, and other functions in an internetwork. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</em></span> is the primary transport layer (layer 4) protocol and is responsible for connection establishment and management, and reliable data transport between software processes on devices. Because these two protocols are so important, their abbreviations have come to represent the entire suite: TCP/IP.</p><p>IP and TCP are important because many of TCP/IP's most critical functions are implemented at layers 3 and 4, where these protocols live. However, there is much more to TCP/IP than just TCP and IP. The protocol suite as a whole requires the work of many different protocols and technologies to make a functional network that can properly provide users with the applications they need.</p><p>TCP/IP uses its own four-layer architecture (which corresponds roughly to the OSI Reference Model), to provide a framework for the various protocols that compose it. It also includes numerous high-level applications, some of which are well known by Internet users who may not realize they are part of TCP/IP, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP, which powers the World Wide Web) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). In the coming discussions on TCP/IP architecture and protocols, we'll look at most of the important TCP/IP protocols and how they fit together.</p><div class="sect2" title="TCP/IP History and Development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="tcpip_history_and_development"/>TCP/IP History and Development</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0393"/>history of the Internet and the history of TCP/IP are so closely related that it is difficult to discuss one without also talking about the other. They were developed together, with TCP/IP providing the mechanism for implementing the Internet. Over the years, TCP/IP has continued to evolve to meet the needs of the Internet and also smaller, private networks that use the technology. We'll take a brief look at that history here.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0394"/></p><p>The TCP/IP protocols were initially created as part of the research network developed by the United States <span class="emphasis"><em>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>DARPA</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>ARPA</em></span>). Initially, this fledgling network, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>ARPAnet</em></span>, was designed to use a number of protocols that had been adapted from existing technologies. However, they all had flaws or limitations either in concept or in practical matters, such as capacity when used on the ARPAnet. The developers of the new network recognized that trying to use these existing protocols might eventually lead to problems as the ARPAnet increased in size and was adapted for newer uses and applications.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0395"/></p><p>In 1973, the development of a full-fledged system of internetworking protocols for the ARPAnet began. Interestingly, early versions of this technology included only one core protocol: TCP. And in fact, these letters didn't even stand for what they do today; they stood for the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transmission Control Program</em></span>. The first version of this predecessor of modern TCP was written in 1973, then revised and formally documented in RFC 675, Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program, published in December 1974.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0396"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-33"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Internet standards are defined in documents called Requests for Comments (RFCs). These documents, and the process used to create them, are described in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. NETWORK STANDARDS AND STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS">Chapter 3</a></em></span>.</p></div><p>Testing and development of TCP continued for several years. In March 1977, version 2 of TCP was documented. In August 1977, a significant turning point came in TCP/IP's development. Jon <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0397"/>Postel, one of the most important pioneers of the Internet and TCP/IP, published a set of comments on the state of TCP. In that document (known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Engineering Note number 2</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>IEN 2</em></span>), he provided an excellent example of how reference models and layers aren't just for textbooks:<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0398"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0399"/></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are screwing up in our design of internet protocols by violating the principle of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0400"/>layering. Specifically we are trying to use TCP to do two things: serve as a host level end to end protocol, and to serve as an internet packaging and routing protocol. These two things should be provided in a layered and modular way. I suggest that a new distinct internetwork protocol is needed, and that TCP be used strictly as a host level end to end protocol.</p><p>—Jon Postel, IEN 2, 1977</p></blockquote></div><p>Postel was essentially saying that the version of TCP created in the mid-1970s was trying to do too much. Specifically, it was encompassing both OSI layer 3 and layer 4 activities. His vision was prophetic, because we now know that having TCP handle all of these activities would have indeed led to problems down the road.</p><p>Postel's observation led to the definition of TCP/IP architecture, and the splitting of TCP into TCP at the transport layer and IP at the network layer. The process of dividing TCP into two portions began in 1978 with version 3 of TCP. The first formal standard for the versions of IP and TCP used in modern networks (version 4) was created in 1980.</p><p>TCP/IP quickly became the standard protocol set for running the ARPAnet. In the 1980s, more and more machines and networks were connected to the evolving ARPAnet using TCP/IP protocols, and the TCP/IP Internet was born.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-53"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> TCP/IP was initially developed in the 1970s as part of an effort to define a set of technologies to operate the fledgling Internet. The name TCP/IP came about when the original <span class="emphasis"><em>Transmission Control Program (TCP)</em></span> was split into the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Protocol (IP)</em></span>. The first modern versions of these two key protocols were documented in 1980 as TCP version 4 and IP version 4, respectively.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Important Factors in the Success of TCP/IP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="important_factors_in_the_success_of_tcpi"/>Important Factors in the Success of TCP/IP</h2></div></div></div><p>TCP/IP was at one time just one of many different sets of protocols that could be used to provide network-layer and transport-layer functionality. Today there are still other options for internetworking protocols, such as Novell's IPX/SPX, but TCP/IP is the universally accepted worldwide standard.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0401"/></p><p>TCP/IP's growth in popularity has been due to a number of important factors. Some of these are historical, such as the fact that it is tied to the Internet as described earlier, while others are related to the characteristics of the protocol suite itself.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Addressing System</strong></span> TCP/IP includes within it (as part of IP primarily) a system for identifying and addressing devices on both small and large networks. The addressing system is designed to allow devices to be addressed regardless of the lower-level details of how each constituent network is constructed. Over time, the mechanisms for addressing in TCP/IP have improved to meet the needs of growing networks, especially the Internet. The addressing system also includes a centralized administration capability for the Internet to ensure that each device has a unique address.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Design for Routing</strong></span> TCP/IP is specifically designed to facilitate the routing of information over a network of arbitrary complexity. In fact, TCP/IP is conceptually concerned more with connecting networks than with connecting devices. TCP/IP routers enable data to be delivered between devices on different networks by moving it one step at a time from one network to the next. A number of support protocols in TCP/IP are designed to allow routers to exchange critical information and manage the efficient flow of information from one network to another.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Underlying Network Independence</strong></span> TCP/IP operates primarily at layers 3 and above, and includes provisions to allow it to function on almost any lower-layer technology, including local area networks (LANs), wireless LANs, and wide area networks (WANs) of various sorts. This flexibility means that you can mix and match a variety of different underlying networks and connect them all using TCP/IP.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0402"/>Scalability</strong></span> One of the most amazing characteristics of TCP/IP is the scalability of its protocols. Over the decades, it has proven its mettle as the Internet has grown from a small network with just a few machines to a huge internetwork with millions of hosts. While some changes have been required periodically to support this growth, these changes have taken place as part of the TCP/IP development process, yet the core of TCP/IP is basically the same as it was 25 years ago.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Open Standards and Development Process</strong></span> The TCP/IP standards, rather than being proprietary, are open ones, freely available to the public. Furthermore, the process used to develop the TCP/IP standards is also completely open. The TCP/IP standards and protocols are developed and modified using the unique, democratic Request for Comments (RFC) process (described in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. NETWORK STANDARDS AND STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS">Chapter 3</a>), with all interested parties invited to participate. This ensures that anyone with an interest in the TCP/IP protocols is given a chance to provide input into their development and also ensures the worldwide acceptance of the protocol suite.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Universality</strong></span> Everyone uses TCP/IP because everyone uses it! This last point is, perhaps ironically, arguably the most important. Not only is TCP/IP the underlying language of the Internet, it is also used in most private networks today. Even former competitors to TCP/IP, such as Novell's NetWare, now use TCP/IP to carry traffic.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-54"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> While TCP/IP is not the only internetworking protocol suite, it is definitely the most important one. Its unparalleled success is due to a wide variety of factors. These include its technical features, such as its routing-friendly design and scalability, its historical role as the protocol suite of the Internet, and its open standards and development process, which reduce barriers to acceptance of TCP/IP protocols.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="TCP/IP Services"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tcpip_services"/>TCP/IP Services</h1></div></div></div><p>TCP/IP is most often studied in terms of its layer-based architecture and the protocols that it provides at those different layers. These protocols, however, represent the technical details of <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> TCP/IP works. They are of interest to us as students of technology, but are normally hidden from users who do not need to see the guts of TCP/IP to know that it works. Before proceeding to these details, let's take a bigger picture look at <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> TCP/IP does.</p><p>In the discussion of the OSI Reference Model concepts (in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. GENERAL OSI REFERENCE MODEL ISSUES AND CONCEPTS">Chapter 5</a>), I mentioned that the theoretical operation of the model is based on the idea of one layer providing <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0403"/>services to the layers above it. TCP/IP covers many layers of the OSI model, and so it collectively provides <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0404"/>services of this sort as well in many ways. Conceptually, we can divide TCP/IP services into two groups:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Services Provided to Other Protocols</strong></span> The first group of services consists of the core functions implemented by the main TCP/IP protocols such as IP, TCP, and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). These services are designed to actually accomplish the internetworking functions of the protocol suite. For example, at the network layer, IP provides functions such as addressing, delivery, datagram packaging, fragmentation, and reassembly. At the transport layer, TCP and UDP are concerned with encapsulating user data and managing connections between devices. Other protocols provide routing and management functionality. Higher-layer protocols use these services, allowing them to concentrate on what they are intended to accomplish.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>End-User Services</strong></span> The second group of services provided by TCP/IP is the set of end-user services. These facilitate the operation of the applications that users run to make use of the power of the Internet and other TCP/IP networks. For example, the Web is arguably the most important Internet application. Web services are provided through HTTP, a TCP/IP application layer protocol. HTTP in turn uses services provided by lower-level protocols. All of these details are hidden from end users, entirely on purpose.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="The TCP/IP Client/Server Structural Model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_tcpip_clientserver_structural_model"/>The TCP/IP Client/Server Structural Model</h1></div></div></div><p>TCP/IP services primarily operate in the <span class="emphasis"><em>client/server</em></span> model. It's a system in which a relatively small number of server machines provides services to a much larger number of client hosts (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. NETWORKING INTRODUCTION, CHARACTERISTICS, AND TYPES">Chapter 1</a>).</p><p>Just as client/server networking applies to hardware, this same concept underlies the design of the TCP/IP protocols and software applications, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s03.html#tcpip_clientserver_operation_most_tcpip_" title="Figure 8-1. TCP/IP client/server operation Most TCP/IP protocols involve communication between two devices, typically as client and server, such as this web (HTTP) transaction over the Internet.">Figure 8-1</a>.</p><p>TCP/IP protocols are not set up so that two machines that want to communicate use identical software. Instead, a conscious decision was made to make communication function using matched, complementary pairs of client and server software. The client initiates communication by sending a request to a server for data or other information. The server then responds with a reply to the client, giving the client what it requested, or else it replies with an alternative response, such as an error message or information about where else it might find the data. Most (but not all) TCP/IP functions work in this manner.</p><div class="figure"><a id="tcpip_clientserver_operation_most_tcpip_"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e8807"/><img alt="TCP/IP client/server operation Most TCP/IP protocols involve communication between two devices, typically as client and server, such as this web (HTTP) transaction over the Internet." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages287719.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-1. TCP/IP client/server operation Most TCP/IP protocols involve communication between two devices, typically as client and server, such as this web (HTTP) transaction over the Internet.</p></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch08s03.html#tcpip_clientserver_operation_most_tcpip_" title="Figure 8-1. TCP/IP client/server operation Most TCP/IP protocols involve communication between two devices, typically as client and server, such as this web (HTTP) transaction over the Internet.">Figure 8-1</a> is a simplified illustration that shows a common example—a web transaction using HTTP. The web browser is an HTTP <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0405"/>client and initiates the communication with a request for a file or other resource sent over the Internet to a website, which is an HTTP <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0406"/>server. The server responds to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0407"/>client with the information requested. (Servers generally respond to many clients simultaneously.)</p><p>There are numerous advantages to <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0408"/>client/server operation in TCP/IP. Just as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0409"/>client hardware and server <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0410"/>hardware can be tailored to their very different jobs, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0411"/>client software and server <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0412"/>software can also be optimized to perform their jobs as efficiently as possible. For example, to get information from the Web, web-client <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0413"/>software (usually called a <span class="emphasis"><em>browser</em></span>) sends requests to a web server. The web server then responds with the requested content. (There's more to it than that, of course, but that's how it appears to the user.) Among other things, the web browser allows the user to communicate with web servers; the web-server software is designed to receive and respond to requests.</p><p>The terms <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> can be confusing in TCP/IP because they are used in several different ways, sometimes simultaneously.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-55"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> The TCP/IP protocol suite is oriented around the notion of <span class="emphasis"><em>client/server</em></span> network communication. Rather than all devices and protocol software elements being designed as peers, they are constructed as matched sets. Clients normally initiate communications by sending requests, and servers respond to such requests, providing the client with the desired data or an informative reply.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Hardware and Software Roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hardware_and_software_roles"/>Hardware and Software Roles</h2></div></div></div><p>The terms <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> usually refer to the primary <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0414"/>roles played by networked hardware. A client computer is usually something like a PC or Macintosh used by an individual; it primarily initiates conversations by sending requests. A <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> is usually a high-powered machine dedicated to responding to client requests, sitting in a computer room somewhere that no one but its administrator ever sees.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0415"/>TCP/IP uses different software for many protocols to implement <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0416"/>client and server roles. For example, a web browser is a piece of client software, while web-server software is completely different. Client software is usually found on client hardware and server software on server hardware, but some devices may run both client and server software.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Transactional Roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="transactional_roles"/>Transactional Roles</h2></div></div></div><p>In any exchange of information, the client is normally the device that initiates communication or sends a query, and then the server responds, usually by providing information. Again, the client software on a client device usually initiates the transaction.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0417"/></p><p>In a typical organization there will be many smaller individual computers designated as clients and a few larger ones that are servers. The servers normally run server software, and the clients run client software. But servers can also be set up with client software, and clients can be set up with server software.</p><p>For example, suppose you are an administrator working in the computer room on server 1 and need to transfer a file to server 2. You start an FTP session to initiate the file transfer with server 2. In this transaction, server 1 is the client, since it is initiating communication. Theoretically, you could even start an FTP transfer from server 1 to a particular client, if that client had FTP server software to answer the server's request. (This is less common, because server software is often not installed on client machines.)</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0418"/>Transactional roles come into play when communication occurs between servers in certain protocols. For example, when two Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers communicate to exchange email (even though they are both server programs running on server hardware), during any transaction, one device acts as the client while the other acts as the server. In some cases, devices can even swap client and server roles in the middle of a session.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-56"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Understanding client/server computing concepts in TCP/IP is made more complex due to the very different meanings that the terms client and server can have in various contexts. The two terms can refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware roles</em></span>—designations given to hardware devices based on whether they usually function as clients or as servers. The terms can also refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>software roles</em></span>, meaning whether protocol software components function as clients or servers. And they can refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>transactional roles</em></span>, meaning whether a device and program functions as a client or server in any given exchange of data.</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-34"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The client and server roles I have discussed are the traditional ones. The rise of powerful personal computers and widespread Internet access (especially always-on broadband connectivity) has led to a significant blurring of client and server hardware and software. Many client machines now include server software that allows them to, for example, respond to World Wide Web queries from other clients. Also, many file-sharing programs allow clients to communicate using the peer-to-peer structural model. However, most TCP/IP communication is still client/server in nature, so it's important to keep these roles in mind</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0419"/></p></div></div></div>

However, it is not the only such model. In fact, the TCP/IP protocol suite was developed before the OSI Reference Model; as such, its inventors didn't use the OSI model to explain TCP/IP architecture (even though the OSI model is often used in TCP/IP discussions today). The developers of TCP/IP created their own architectural model, which goes by different names including the <span class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP model</em></span>, the <span class="emphasis"><em>DARPA model</em></span> (after the agency that was largely responsible for developing TCP/IP) and the <span class="emphasis"><em>DoD model</em></span> (after the United States Department of Defense). Most people call it the TCP/IP model.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0420"/></p><p>Regardless of the model you use to represent the function of a network, the model's functions are pretty much the same. The TCP/IP and the OSI models are really quite similar, even if they don't carve up the network functionality precisely the same way.</p><p>Since the OSI model is so widely used, it is common to explain the TCP/IP architecture both in terms of the TCP/IP layers and the corresponding OSI layers. <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#osi_reference_model_and_tcpip_model_laye" title="Figure 8-2. OSI Reference Model and TCP/IP model layers The TCP/IP architectural model has four layers that approximately match six of the seven layers in the OSI Reference Model.">Figure 8-2</a> shows the relationship between the two models.

These protocols, the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), fill the gap between the network layer and the physical layer.

It is responsible for typical layer 3 jobs, such as logical device addressing, data packaging, manipulation and delivery, and routing. At this layer, you find IP, which is arguably the heart of TCP/IP, as well as support protocols such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and the routing protocols (RIP, OSFP, BGP, and so on). IP version 6, the next-generation IP, is also at this layer.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0424"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Host-to-Host Transport Layer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="host-to-host_transport_layer"/>Host-to-Host Transport Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>This primary job of the host-to-host transport layer is to facilitate end-to-end communication over an internetwork. It is in charge of allowing logical connections to be made between devices that allow data to be sent either unreliably (with no guarantee that it gets there) or reliably (where the protocol keeps track of the data sent and received in order to make sure it arrives, and resends it if necessary). It is also here that identification of the specific source and destination application process is accomplished.</p><p>The formal name of this layer is often shortened to just the <span class="emphasis"><em>transport layer</em></span>. The key TCP/IP protocols at this layer are TCP and UDP. The TCP/IP transport layer corresponds to the layer of the same name in the OSI model (layer 4) but includes certain elements that are arguably part of the OSI session layer. For example, TCP establishes a connection that can persist for a long period of time, which some people say makes a TCP connection more like a session.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Application Layer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="application_layer"/>Application Layer</h2></div></div></div><p>The application layer is the highest layer in the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-8-0425"/>TCP/IP model. It is a rather broad layer, encompassing layers 5 through 7 in the OSI model. While this seems to represent a loss of detail compared to the OSI model, that's probably a good thing. The TCP/IP model better reflects the somewhat fuzzy nature of the divisions between the functions of the higher layers in the OSI model, which in practical terms often seem rather arbitrary. It really is hard to separate some protocols in terms of which portions of layers 5, 6, or 7 they encompass.</p><p>Numerous protocols reside at the application layer. These include application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP for providing end-user services as well as administrative protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and Domain Name System (DNS).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-35"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Internet and host-to-host transport layers are usually considered the core of TCP/IP architecture, because they contain most of the key protocols that implement TCP/IP internetworks</em></span>.</p></div><p>In the following section, I provide a brief look at each of the TCP/IP protocols covered in detail in this book and offer more detail on where they all fit into the TCP/IP architecture.

The TCP/IP model includes four layers: the <span class="emphasis"><em>network interface layer</em></span> (responsible for interfacing the suite to the physical hardware on which it runs), the <span class="emphasis"><em>Internet layer</em></span> (where device addressing, basic datagram communication, and routing take place), the <span class="emphasis"><em>host-to-host transport layer</em></span> (where connections are managed and reliable communication is ensured), and the <span class="emphasis"><em>application layer</em></span> (where end-user applications and services reside). The first three layers correspond to layers 2 through 4 of the OSI Reference Model respectively; the application layer is equivalent to OSI layers 5 to 7.</p></div></div></div>
