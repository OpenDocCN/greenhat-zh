This only makes sense, because it is those two tools that turn a web-surfing, game-playing, music-churning, number-crunching box of chips into a meaningful production tool—a virtual publishing house, if you will. These two tools help your computer convert digital information into hard copy (in the case of printers) and convert hard copy into digital information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising, therefore, that these tools often come together these days in the form of multifunction printers.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn how to connect these useful devices to your computer, how to set them up, and how to use them. If you're more into working with your digital camera than with a scanner, you might want to sneak a peek at <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. BRUSH-WIELDING PENGUINS">Chapter 13</a>; otherwise, put on your printer's smock, and read on.</p><div class="sect1" title="Printers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="printers"/>Printers</h1></div></div></div><p>Unless the only thing you use your computer for is playing games, listening to MP3s, or stopping doors on hot, breezy days, you will no doubt want to hook up your machine to a printer. Despite the paperless-office era that the personal computer was supposedly going to usher in, it seems that the computer's strength as a desktop-publishing and general work tool has made producing high-quality printed documents an even more attractive proposition than ever before.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1010" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="confirming_that_your_printer_is_supporte"/>Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported</h2></div></div></div><p>Setting up a printer to work with your new system is a pretty easy task, and it seems that printer support in the Linux world gets better with each release. In general, support for Epson, Brother, Samsung, and Hewlett-Packard printers is good, while support for other makers and other printer types is a bit spottier (though improving).</p><p>If you really want to make sure your printer is supported, just try it by following the instructions in the next section. If you are thinking about buying a printer or are trying to decide whether to switch to Linux, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/">http://www.linuxprinting.org/</a>. On that site, you can check out the online database to see whether your printer is currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers also include information on what drivers are best for your purposes. There is also a page of suggested makes and models, in case you're considering buying a printer with the intent of using it with your Linux system. Read this before making your purchase decision. You might also want to consult Ubuntu's list at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Ubuntu to Automatically Recognize and Set Up Your Printer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_ubuntu_to_automatically_recogniz"/>Getting Ubuntu to Automatically Recognize and Set Up Your Printer</h2></div></div></div><p>Printer handling in Ubuntu is pretty much a no-brainer, because Ubuntu automatically detects most printers. If you have a USB printer, connect it to your computer, and then power up the printer (vice versa should work just fine, too). Assuming Ubuntu recognizes your printer, and chances are it will, a small printer icon will appear in the upper-right panel while the system goes through its automatic setup routine. When it is done, a small notification bubble like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#ubuntu_lets_you_know_it_has_automaticall" title="Figure 10-1. Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured your printer.">Figure 10-1</a> will appear, telling you that your printer has been recognized. There is nothing more for you to do in this case—your printer is set up and ready to roll.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1015" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It is also possible, however, that Ubuntu will recognize your printer but not find a driver that is an exact match for it. In this case, it will offer a substitute driver, and the autorecognition window will look slightly different from the one in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#ubuntu_lets_you_know_it_has_automaticall" title="Figure 10-1. Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured your printer.">Figure 10-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ubuntu_lets_you_know_it_has_automaticall"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e15439"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656405.png.jpg" alt="Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured your printer."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-1. Ubuntu lets you know it has automatically recognized and configured your printer.</p></div><p>If you find yourself in this situation, it wouldn't be a bad idea to print a test page to see whether the substituted driver works as it should. You can do this by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Administration</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Printing</strong></span> and then double-clicking your printer in the Printing window that appears.

If the test page looks normal (something like <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#an_ubuntu_test_print_page" title="Figure 10-3. An Ubuntu test print page">Figure 10-3</a>), things should be fine, and you can close the Printer Properties and Printing windows.</p><div class="figure"><a id="printing_a_test_page_with_your_new_print"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e15469"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656407.png.jpg" alt="Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-2. Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window</p></div><p>If you have a printer that plugs into your computer's parallel port, autodetection and setup should also work if the printer was connected when you turned on the computer. If it was not, shut down your system and turn your computer off, connect your printer to the computer, turn on the printer, and then start your computer again.

On that site, I found not only the driver for my printer but also the driver for its built-in scanner.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1027" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You might also want to check the website for the manufacturer of your printer, because many now provide Linux drivers for a number of their printers. Brother, Lexmark, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Samsung do, to name a few. There is also a German company (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.turboprint.info/">http://www.turboprint.info/</a>) that provides Linux drivers, albeit for a fee, for machines that are really hard to deal with and for high-quality graphics solutions.</p><p>If you happen to find and download a driver for your printer that does not come with its own installer, just follow the directions given for trying Windows drivers. Finally, don't forget to give the Ubuntu forums (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/</a>) a try to see whether anyone there has any experience getting the printer in question to work on their system.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Trial and Error"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="trial_and_error"/>Trial and Error</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, there is always the old trial-and-error approach, which works on occasion.

This is an easy task, and it isn't very different from how it works in the Windows and Mac worlds, so you shouldn't need much explanation to proceed. In fact, printing in Ubuntu has become easier than ever, because all the settings you would normally want to toy with are all on their own tabs within the Print window that appears when you select Print in an application's File menu. I would even dare say that figuring out printing options in Ubuntu is now easier than it is in Windows or OS X.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1030" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You should be aware that the function of the tabs can vary depending on the application you happen to be printing from. For instance, the tabs you'll see when printing from the GIMP will be slightly different from those you will see when printing from Firefox. The General and Page Setup tabs will almost always be there, however. All that said, I'll give you an idea of some of the settings that are available within some of the Print window's tabs:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Printer selection, pages to print, number of copies, order of printing, collating</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Page Setup</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Pages per sheet, scaling, paper type, paper source, output tray</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Print frames, shrink to fit page, print background, headers and footers</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Image Settings</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Size, resolution, page positioning</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Job</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Print timing (now, later, at time), cover page</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>Image Quality/Advanced</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Output resolution (DPI), printing speed and quality</p></dd></dl></div><div class="sect3" title="Printing in OpenOffice.org"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="printing_in_openoffice.org"/>Printing in OpenOffice.org</h3></div></div></div><p>Occasionally, you will come across an application such as OpenOffice.org that has a slightly different way of handling printing.

Whether you are <span class="emphasis"><em>saving as</em></span> PDF, <span class="emphasis"><em>exporting to</em></span> PDF, or <span class="emphasis"><em>printing to</em></span> PDF, you are essentially doing the same thing: creating a PDF file of your document.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1038" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This is very handy, because it allows you to create documents that cannot be altered by others and yet can easily be read regardless of the word processor program or operating system the reader is using.

You might also run into problems with the printer, such as streaks on printouts or jagged lines that should really be straight, so it might be necessary to clean or align the print heads too. Unfortunately, there's no one simple method of doing this since every make of printer handles it differently.

One of the first areas of confusion is that there is a general blurring of how the terms <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels per inch (ppi)</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>dots per inch (dpi)</em></span> are used. Most applications use these terms interchangeably, and yet they aren't really the same thing. To make things simple, when you are talking about images on your screen, you are talking about <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span> (the little squares that make up your screen image) per inch, and when you are talking about printer resolution, you are talking about <span class="emphasis"><em>dots</em></span> (of printer ink) per inch.</p><p>Your computer screen generally has a resolution of 96ppi, while most modern inkjet and laser printers have a resolution range of 300 to 1200dpi, or sometimes even more. This means that a photo scanned at 96ppi, which looks just fine on your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it. On the other hand, when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will look much better in your printout but will be gigantic if you display it "full size" on your screen. This is because there will be three times as many pixels per inch, so it looks three times bigger onscreen.</p><p>As an example, look at <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen" title="Figure 10-14. The same image scanned at three different resolutions">Figure 10-14</a>, where you can see an identical image scanned at three different resolutions: 96ppi, 150ppi, and 300ppi. As you can see, the 96ppi image at the far left (measuring 5 by 6 inches—about the size of the hard copy itself) is the smallest, while the other two images are proportionally bigger (about 10 by 12 inches for the 150ppi image and about 22 by 25 inches for the 300ppi image).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e16331"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656431.png.jpg" alt="The same image scanned at three different resolutions"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-14. The same image scanned at three different resolutions</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Which Resolution Should I Use When Scanning?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="which_resolution_should_i_use_when_scann"/>Which Resolution Should I Use When Scanning?</h2></div></div></div><p>Which resolution you use when scanning depends on a variety of factors, the most important of which is what you plan to do with the image when you're finished. When I look at <a class="xref" href="ch10s02.html#the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen" title="Figure 10-14. The same image scanned at three different resolutions">Figure 10-14</a> on my computer screen, the smallest image looks best, the middle image looks OK, and the largest looks a bit odd, not as sharp as the other two. Basically, when scanning images for display on a computer—on web pages, for instance—it is probably best to stick with a ppi similar to typical screen resolutions or slightly larger: 96 to 150ppi.<a id="IDX-CHP-10-1063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1066" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-10-1067" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When it comes to printing, a whole new set of considerations comes into play. First, there are the limitations of your scanner, since different models have different maximum resolutions. The resolution limits of your printer are also, naturally enough, a major consideration. For example, laser printers and inkjet printers have different characteristics; laser printers will generally produce better-quality images than inkjet printers, while inkjet output will be more greatly affected by the type of paper used than a laser printer will be. Of course, your printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images at higher resolutions than those at which you plan to print them, but you will end up with a lot of files taking up too much disk space. Remember, <span class="emphasis"><em>the higher the resolution of a scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk space</em></span>. If this is of concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you're done printing using an application such as the GIMP (more on that in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. BRUSH-WIELDING PENGUINS">Chapter 13</a>), but if you would prefer not being so cavalier with your use of disk space from the get-go, you can follow these very general guidelines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you are using a laser printer, scan at the same resolution at which you are going to print.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you are going to use an inkjet printer with photo-quality paper, scan at about 80 percent of your target printout resolution—about 240ppi for a 300dpi printout.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you are using an inkjet printer with regular paper, scan at about 65 percent of your target printout resolution—about 195ppi for a 300dpi printout.</p></li></ul></div><p>Needless to say, these are just suggestions to get you started. What works best for you and your particular scanner/printer setup may be slightly different. Nothing works better than a bit of experimentation and trial and error. In this case, you can't really go wrong. Just give yourself some time, don't get frustrated, and, most importantly, don't wait until you desperately need to scan something before trying things—stay ahead of the game.</p></div></div></body></html>
