    the development team; he also works with marketing to set the product direction
    for the company. Developing the direction should be a collaborative effort that
    involves the technical leaders of the sales, marketing, and development teams.
    Important considerations in setting product direction include market requirements,
    customer requirements, industry technical direction, and company needs.

    Without specific direction, engineers can be influenced and motivated by factors
    that are not particularly business focused, such as the thrill of working with
    new technologies or approaches or rewriting code rather than reusing it. Engineers
    also have strong preferences for particular software and systems, and they may
    select third-party packages based on short-term utility while not considering
    long-term costs, effect on quality, and business risks.

    decisions in the past before you set the direction for the future. Try to understand
    the reasoning behind past decisions. Think about choices of language, operating
    systems, computers, third-party software, and data formats. Consider past "create-versus-buy"
    decisions. Knowing how decisions were made in the past can help you understand
    any biases of the team and will give you ideas for improving the technical decision-making
    going forward. In some cases, the reasons for past decisions may not be clear—but
    this should not prevent you from documenting decisions now or in the future.

    most small companies grow by acquiring new customers and selling more products
    to current customers, looking ahead to new customers' needs should be an important
    part of your planning efforts. If you focus only on current customers' needs,
    you can run the risk of over-customizing your product to suit a smaller potential
    market. The product marketing team should regularly examine your company's markets,
    talking to current and potential customers. This information allows the team to
    identify different groups of customers with similar problems. For each group,
    the marketing team can examine the value a potential solution would bring, and
    the development team can determine practicality and potential costs of solutions.
    With different options identified, marketing can set the product direction.

    a similar set of problems for a different industry.

    The development team needs technical expertise in the requirements of the new
    industry before a new product is designed and built. Part of your planning should
    be to account for the engineering training time required to attack new verticals.

    CB analysis is used to determine which projects will create the most revenue.
    This analysis is underutilized in the software market because of the complexities

    benefit). For a productivity project, look at the benefit of saved time and money

    For large projects that span a year, for example, consider breaking them up into
    blocks of functionalities that offer distinct values to the customer. For each
    component, perform a cost-benefit calculation specifically focused on the perceived
    value of the product to the customer with only that functionality. This analysis
    approach is more difficult than project cost-benefit calculations, because calculating
    the financial return for pieces of functionality can be an abstract concept. However,
    discussing with marketing the relative value versus cost for functional blocks
    offers considerable utility, since it forces marketing to prioritize and record
    the effective values of different feature sets. Allowing marketing or management
    to indicate that all features must be included in the product in no particular
    order before it has any value lowers the project's chance for success.

    new feature requests into the product without considering the impact these may

    hierarchy offers a clear chain of command. The top management makes directives
    and sends them down the management chain. Second, management can reduce communication
    paths by creating separate functional teams, which reduces communication noise.
    The different functional teams communicate mostly internally at a smaller scale,
    while inter-team communication is reduced. In addition, functional areas can optimize
    internal workflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, many problems can exist in a hierarchical structure. First,
    each manager can optimize his or her department to the detriment of the overall
    company. This happens because each functional team is part of a production chain
    required to deliver the product or service, but each team is managed independently.
    As each functional manager is focused on the efficiency of his or her team, the
    manager may not focus on the efficiency of the organization as a whole. For example,
    a functional team can push part of its work onto the next team by reducing the
    scope of what it delivers, completing it with poor quality, or completing 80 percent
    of the work and promising that the rest will come later. These tactics make it
    appear as though the team has completed a milestone on time so the statistics
    look good, but such approaches lower the overall efficiency of the company.

    a non-project focus, and different priorities for different teams. For example,
    if five projects are active, but only two QA engineers are on staff, situations

    engineers at the same time. This results in the delay of three or more projects.

    person is assigned. Small product teams can also have problems with coordinating

    corporate purchasing of equipment and software, although this is a relatively
    small problem compared to the effectiveness advantages. Finally, once the team
    is set up, this method offers less flexibility in going after new product areas.

    group, engineering, and operations.

    create the web application, working with other teams. To complete an order, the
    engineering team needs to use the services of a translation vendor and the graphics
    team. Engineering also works with QA to complete the website. Engineering has
    to ask purchasing for translation vendor support. The translation vendor gets
    requests directly from your purchasing group in finance while finance's accounts
    payable team looks for payment.

    receives the website from QA and deploys it. Operations also lets accounts billable
    know when a website goes up, but because no particular order number is used in
    the process, operations sends over a general description of the site and a date
    deployed. As you are leaving the operations area, the operations manager also
    tells you that he gets no advance notice of orders and really has to scramble
    to schedule deployment work.
  prefs: []

- en: Finally, you talk with the accounts billable and accounts payable groups in
    finance. They tell a different story. Too often the accounts billable team has
    to ask sales for an order when it comes in. They also have difficulty understanding
    whom to bill when operations puts up a website, because they don't have a purchase
    order number from operations. So they have to call sales, operations, and sometimes
    engineering to figure it out.

    high-level diagram to focus on the specifics of this workflow. You revise your

    to both accounts billable and operations. Operations now has the reference order
    number and some notice of the order being completed by engineering. Operations
    is then required to attached the order number to the deployment notice given to
    accounts payable. Operations will also be the backup check if it finds a web deployment
    but no corresponding order from sales—operations can talk to sales directly to
    request the order and have enough information to identify the appropriate order.
