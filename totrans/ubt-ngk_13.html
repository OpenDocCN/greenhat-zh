Yes, Linux does art, and as you will soon find out, a good number of programs on your system allow you to create and manipulate graphic files. These days, however, there is perhaps nothing as important to most users' graphical repertoires as their digital cameras, so that is where we'll begin.</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 13A: Importing Images from Digital Cameras"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_13a_colon_importing_images_from"/>Project 13A: Importing Images from Digital Cameras</h1></div></div></div><p>Although scanner support for Linux can prove a bit spotty, support for digital cameras is practically a worry-free affair. In fact, if Ubuntu can't figure out what kind of camera you have, it just treats it as if it were an external hard drive or flash drive plugged into your computer's USB port. And even if your camera doesn't seem to communicate with your computer when connected directly, you can still transfer your images to your hard disk by removing the memory card from your camera, inserting it into a USB flash memory card reader, and plugging that reader into one of your computer's USB ports. In that case, your system will mount the card reader as if it were an external drive (which is pretty much what it is), thus allowing you to copy the images to your hard disk. Of course, you can use this method even if your camera works just fine with Ubuntu—some people find it to be the easiest way to deal with things, anyway.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1169" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1170" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1171" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1172" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1173" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1174" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1175" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1176" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="13A-1: Importing Images from Camera to Computer Somewhat Automatically via F-Spot"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_importing_images_from_camera_t"/>13A-1: Importing Images from Camera to Computer Somewhat Automatically via F-Spot</h2></div></div></div><p>When you connect your camera to your computer via a USB cable, put your camera in play mode, and power it on, Ubuntu will usually automatically recognize it and open a window that asks how you want to import the photos on the camera.

And working in conjunction with Evolution, the default email software in Ubuntu, F-Spot allows you to easily send images via email (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Send by Mail</strong></span>) without fiddling around with attachments. You can run F-Spot by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>F-Spot Photo Manager</strong></span>.

Fortunately, F-Spot has a few ways of making this easier to deal with, one of which is the timeline slider, located immediately above the thumbnail-viewing pane, which allows you to locate images by year and month.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1184" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1185" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1186" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1187" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1188" class="indexterm"/></p><p>An additional and interesting way of organizing things is by using <span class="emphasis"><em>tags</em></span>, which allow you to identify images thematically. Applying tags and using such tags to narrow down your photo searches is pretty easy to do.</p><p>First, to apply tags to your images, just drag the appropriate tag icon from the left pane of the F-Spot window directly onto the image you want to tag. You can place more than one tag on a picture. Once you have added the tag, a small version of the tag icon will appear below the image, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch13s02.html#using_f-spot_apostrophy_s_tags_feature_t" title="Figure 13-6. Using F-Spot's tags feature to help deal with hefty photo collections">Figure 13-6</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_f-spot_apostrophy_s_tags_feature_t"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e18434"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656520.png.jpg" alt="Using F-Spot's tags feature to help deal with hefty photo collections"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-6. Using F-Spot's tags feature to help deal with hefty photo collections</p></div><p>The number of preset tags is rather limited, but you can add your own by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Tags</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Tag</strong></span>.</p><p>Give your tag a name in the Create New Tag window that appears, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>. The new tag will then appear in the left pane of the F-Spot window, albeit without an icon. There are two ways to add an icon.

In the window that appears, click the iconless button next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Icon</em></span>, and then select one of the predefined icons in the window that appears. You can also use this approach to edit the photo of an automatically created tag, which allows you to determine exactly what portion of a picture you want to use as the icon for that tag (<a class="xref" href="ch13s02.html#modifying_the_portion_of_photo_used_as_a" title="Figure 13-7. Modifying the portion of photo used as an icon tag in F-Spot">Figure 13-7</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="modifying_the_portion_of_photo_used_as_a"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e18465"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656522.png.jpg" alt="Modifying the portion of photo used as an icon tag in F-Spot"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-7. Modifying the portion of photo used as an icon tag in F-Spot</p></div><p>Searching for images by tag is perhaps even easier than adding the tags to the images in the first place. Let's say you wanted to find all of your images that were tagged as <span class="emphasis"><em>Events</em></span>. You would first go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Find</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Find Selected Tag</strong></span>. A find bar will then appear directly above the thumbnail-viewing area of the F-Spot window. Drag the icon for the Events tag to that find bar, and almost immediately images tagged as <span class="emphasis"><em>Events</em></span> will appear in the thumbnail area below. Sweet.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Getting Arty with the GIMP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="getting_arty_with_the_gimp"/>Getting Arty with the GIMP</h1></div></div></div><p>The Windows and Mac worlds may have Photoshop, but the Linux world has the GIMP (see <a class="xref" href="ch13s03.html#manipulating_a_digital_image_in_the_gimp" title="Figure 13-8. Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP">Figure 13-8</a>). Although arguably not as powerful as Photoshop, the GIMP is a capable contender, which may explain why it has been ported to both Mac and Windows. The GIMP allows you to create bitmap graphics and, quite importantly, retouch or completely doctor image files. With the GIMP you can get rid of red-eye in your digital photos, airbrush out unwanted shadows (or even facial blemishes), give your image a canvas texture, change a photo into an oil painting, and even add a bell pepper here and there—with drop shadows no less.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1192" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1193" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1194" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1195" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1189" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1190" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1191" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1196" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="manipulating_a_digital_image_in_the_gimp"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e18532"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656524.png.jpg" alt="Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-8. Manipulating a digital image in the GIMP</p></div><p>Because not everyone needs or uses the power of the GIMP, the powers that be unfortunately decided to no longer bundle it on the Ubuntu Desktop CD, thus freeing up space for more frequently run applications. Pity though that might be, you can still install the GIMP via the Ubuntu Software Center. Just do a search for <span class="emphasis"><em>GIMP</em></span>, and then install it as you would any application, as you learned to do in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a>. Once installed, you can run the GIMP by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>GIMP Image Editor</strong></span>.</p><div class="sect2" title="Using the GIMP to Resize Images and Convert File Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_the_gimp_to_resize_images_and_conv"/>Using the GIMP to Resize Images and Convert File Formats</h2></div></div></div><p>Like F-Spot, the GIMP is also a very handy tool for resizing images. You can do this by simply right-clicking an image opened in the GIMP and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Image</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. This will open the Scale Image window, where you can set the new size of the image.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1197" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1198" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The GIMP is also an excellent tool for converting images from one file format to another. You can, for example, open a bitmap (<span class="emphasis"><em>.bmp</em></span>) file and save it as a PNG (<span class="emphasis"><em>.png</em></span>) file, save a JPEG (<span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span>) file as a GIF (<span class="emphasis"><em>.gif</em></span>) file, and so on. Although this can also be done with other graphics applications, the GIMP supports an extremely wide variety of file formats, and it even lets you save an image file as a compressed tarball, which makes it a true file conversion king.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1199" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To perform a file conversion, just right-click an image opened within the GIMP, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. You can make the same selection from the File menu if you prefer. Either way, the Save Image window will then appear. In that window, you can specify the new file format by replacing the original file extension in the Name box at the top of that window with the extension for the format you want to convert the image to. If you're not sure what formats are available to you, click the small arrow to the left of the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Select File Type (By Extension)</em></span>, and then choose from the options in the pane that appears below. To save a work in progress, use the GIMP-native XCF format so that you can continue working on the image later.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Learning More"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="learning_more"/>Learning More</h2></div></div></div><p>It is lots of fun to learn to use the GIMP by just playing around with it for a while.

Once it is installed, you can access the manual from within the GIMP from the Help menu.

For example, let's say you want to convert 100 of your photos so they look like black-and-white snapshots with white borders, are 50 percent smaller than the originals, have a similar thematic filename, and are saved in <span class="emphasis"><em>.tiff</em></span> rather than <span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span> format.

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch13s05.html#art_done_simplemgpaint" title="Figure 13-10. Art done simple—gpaint">Figure 13-10</a>, gpaint is similar to Windows Paint and MacPaint, and just as simple.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1212" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1213" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1209" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1210" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1211" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="art_done_simplemgpaint"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject13_d1e18790"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656528.png.jpg" alt="Art done simple—gpaint"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 13-10. Art done simple—gpaint</p></div><p>Once you have installed gpaint, you can run it by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>GNU Paint</strong></span>.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Inkscape"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="inkscape"/>Inkscape</h1></div></div></div><p>The GIMP, like other so-called paint programs, creates bitmap images in various file formats. These are images in which the location and color of every single pixel is recorded. The image is essentially a collection of dots, or <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span>. The file you create is a rather hefty map of these pixels, and this map tells your system where everything in your image is supposed to go when it is displayed or printed.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1215" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1216" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1214" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1217" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Drawing programs</em></span>, on the other hand, create vector images, which are actually collections of mathematical formulae representing the various shapes in your image. This may sound rather unimportant to you, but such drawings have advantages in certain cases. One of these advantages is that vector image files take up less space on your hard disk than bitmaps. Another, and perhaps the most important, advantage is that shapes in vector images retain their smooth edges when the images are enlarged. A smooth circle created as a bitmap, for example, would begin to show jagged edges ("the jaggies") when enlarged to any extent, while the same circle in a vector image would remain smooth and round no matter how much you increased its size.<a id="IDX-CHP-13-1218" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-13-1219" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you're interested in giving a drawing program a go, then try Inkscape (see <a class="xref" href="ch13s06.html#inkscape-id1" title="Figure 13-11. Inkscape">Figure 13-11</a>).
