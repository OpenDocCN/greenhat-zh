  <h1><span class="chapter">Chapter 3 -</span><br/>
  Installing a Blue LED</h1>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that you have taken the cover off of your Xbox, it is time to do a <span style="font-size: 1em;">couple of starter projects. The next chapters walk you through some</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">elementary modifications and repairs that you can perform on your Xbox.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">These projects are designed and written for readers who have little or no</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">experience with hardware hacking. More advanced topics on the Xbox can be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">found in later chapters.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In this chapter, you will learn how to replace the normally green LED in <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Xbox front panel with a blue LED. This project requires minimal</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">soldering; most of the effort is in removing the front panel and the LED</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">circuit assembly. Let’s get started!</span></p>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Note</h3>

    <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3"><img alt="" class="calibre2 note" src="../Images/index-71_1.png" style="font-weight: normal;"/></b></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A stock Xbox uses a green/red combo LED, but the red LED</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">is only used to indicate error conditions. The procedure</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">described in this chapter will convert your Xbox front panel</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">indicator into a blue-only LED. The proper substitute would</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">be a blue/red combo LED (T-1, 3mm diameter lens). How</b><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">ever they are difficult to find, so the instructions here do</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">not use them. The instructions will give the necessary back</b><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">ground knowledge for you to improvise and incorporate</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">your own LED solution if you are so inclined.</b></p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_32"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">What You’ll Need</b><br/></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The following is a list of the equipment that you’ll need to complete this <span style="font-size: 1em;">project:</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Low-wattage soldering iron with a fine point tip</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Solder</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Flux and soldering iron tip cleaner (optional)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Smal flathead screwdriver</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• T-10 bit Torx driver</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Two low voltage (3 volt) blue LEDs in a T-1 (3 mm) case</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• Masking tape for holding parts in place during soldering</p>

  <p class="calibre1">You can substitute any color LED that you like, but it must turn on at a <span style="font-size: 1em;">voltage of around 3 volts and have a T-1 style case. Pay attention when</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">buying your LEDs, because many blue and white LEDs are rated to work</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">only at 5 volts. The LED used here is a Lumex SSL-LX3044USBC which</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">you can buy through Digi-Key (www.digikey.com); part number 67-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">1747-ND. (For the budget-conscious, Digi-Key can send the LEDs via</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">United States Postal service’s first class mail. Note that there is a $5</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">handling fee for orders through Digi-Key that are less than $25.)</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em;">If Digi-Key’s minimum order restriction is a problem for you, Mouser</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Electronics (www.mouser.com) also has a line of blue LEDs, and they</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">have no minimum order. An example part is the Kingbright blue LED in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a T-1 case with a water clear lens; the Mouser stock number is 604-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">L7104PBC/H for the brighter, slightly higher voltage version, or 604-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">L7104QB/D for a version that operates at a lower voltage but with a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">lower rated brightness.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">You can also use a bi-color LED if you would like to maintain the error <span style="font-size: 1em;">condition LED functionality as well. The Xbox requires a common-cathode</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">bi-color LED in a T-1 case with three leads. Unfortunately, bi-color LEDs</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with a blue element in the smaller T-1 case are very difficult to find.</span></p>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_33"><b class="calibre3">Removing the Xbox Front Panel</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The Xbox front panel is a molded piece of ABS plastic that is held in place with four T-10 torx screws and three molded friction locks. The electronics in the front panel connect to the Xbox motherboard through a single nine-wire connector that winds its way through a hole in the metal electromagnetic interference shield.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Open the Xbox as instructed in Chapter 1. Lift and move the hard drive <span style="font-size: 1em;">and the DVD drive up and toward the back of the box just enough to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">expose the front edge of the Xbox motherboard. You should not have to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">undo any of the disk drive cables. Figure 3-1 illustrates how your Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">should look after these steps.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-73_1.png"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-1</b>: Position the disk drives so that the front edge of the motherboard is exposed.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Note</h3><img alt="" src="../Images/index-73_2.png" style="font-size: 1em;"/>

    <p>Older Xbox models will have a vertically mounted PC board near the front of the Xbox. This PC board can be removed by grasping the board and pulling it out of its socket. You may find that removing the vertically mounted PC board is helpful when trying to release the middle friction lock of the front panel. Do not forget to replace the PC board when you are done!</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1">Remove the four screws that hold the front panel assembly in place (see <span style="font-size: 1em;">Figure 3-2).</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Detach the front panel wire connector from the Xbox motherboard as <span style="font-size: 1em;">shown in Figure 3-3. A firm, steady force is all the connector should</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">require. (Do not jerk the connector out, because you may damage the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">wires.)</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-74_2.png" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"/><br/></b></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-2</b>: Location of the four retaining screws on the front panel assembly.<br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><span style="font-style: normal;">Now for the tricky part: the friction locks. A friction lock is a hook made out of plastic that holds parts together. The hook is shaped so that it is easy to insert, but difficult to extract. Releasing a friction lock typically requires some kind of bending or pushing on the plastic.</span><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-74_1.png"/><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-3</b>: Detach the front panel wire connector from the Xbox motherboard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Three friction locks hold the front panel in place: one on either edge of <span style="font-size: 1em;">the front panel, and one in the middle poking through the metal electro</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">magnetic interference shield. First, loosen the friction locks on the edge</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">using a thin-bladed flathead screwdriver as shown in Figure 3-4. These</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">locks are very tight, and you may have to release it in sections, starting</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with the top section. Insert the screwdriver tip into the space along the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">side between the panel and the main case body, and pry until you feel a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">slight give. Remove the screwdriver and repeat the process near the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">bottom of the case. You may need to try several times before the lock is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">free. Do not apply excess force to the case, as you could crack or nick the plastic. When the edge of the front panel is free, you will be able to flex it away from the case. Repeat this process for both edges.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-75_1.png"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em;">Once both edges are free, pull up on the middle friction lock (shown in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Figure 3-5), and the front panel should pop off.</span><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once the front panel is free, thread the front panel wire connector <span style="font-size: 1em;">through the hole in the metal electromagnetic interference shield and lay</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the panel flat on a table with the outer face down.</span></p>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_34"><b class="calibre3">Removing the Front Panel Circuit</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Board</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The front panel assembly of the Xbox contains a small circuit board, <span style="font-size: 1em;">held in place with a single friction lock retaining clip, as shown in Figure 3-6. Use a finger or a screwdriver to push down on the friction lock and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pull the front panel circuit board assembly out of its cradle.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lay the circuit board assembly on a table with the green side down. You <span style="font-size: 1em;">should see two clear LEDs and two flat push-button switches.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-77_1.png"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-6</b>: Lift the printed circuit assembly out of the front panel. (1) Push down on the friction lock tab, using a screwdriver if necessary, (2) then lift the assembly out of the front panel.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_35"><b class="calibre3">Installing the Blue LED</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that the circuit card assembly has been removed, it is time to install <span style="font-size: 1em;">the blue LED. This will require some soldering, so plug your soldering</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">iron in and let it heat up. Keep in mind that it is important to use a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">soldering iron with a fine tip and to use soldering iron tip cleaner to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">condition the tip before using it. See Appendix A, “Where To get Your</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Hacking Gear,” if you need any of these items; you can equip yourself</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">for just a little more than the cost of a video game.</span></p>

  <p>Remove both existing LEDs with a flush-cutting wire cutter. Preserve as <span style="font-size: 1em;">much of the metal legs coming out of the LEDs as possible because you</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">will use them to attach your blue LED later on. Figure 3-7 shows how the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">circuit board should look when you are finished.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-78_1.png"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-7</b>: Cut the existing LEDs off the circuit card assembly. (Top) cut the LED as close to the case as possible; (bottom) the LED removed. Use this procedure to remove both LEDs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To assist with soldering, tape the circuit board down to a flat surface with a piece of masking tape, so that it does not move. Position the blue <span style="font-size: 1em;">LEDs so that their legs touch the metal stubs of the old LEDs on the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">circuit board assembly. (Figure 3-8 shows how to identify the polarity of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">an LED and their proper orientation on the circuit card assembly. See the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">sidebar “The Anatomy of an LED” if you are unsure about how to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">identify the polarity of an LED.)</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tape the lens portion of the LEDs in place with masking tape so they do <span style="font-size: 1em;">not roll around while you solder them. You wil need to bend or cut the legs of the LED that will be installed on the right hand side of the board</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">because the yellow wire connector will be in the way.</span></p>

  <div class="note">
    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Warning</h3><img alt="" class="calibre2 note" src="../Images/index-78_2.png" style="font-size: 1em;"/>

    <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pay careful attention to an LED’s polarity. If you install an</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">LED backwards, no light will be emitted. See the sidebar</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">on the Anatomy of an LED if you are unsure how to identify</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">the polarity of an LED.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="figure_3-8" src="../Images/figure_3-8.png" style="width: 100%;"/><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-8</b>: Placement of the blue LEDs on the front panel circuit board assembly. Note the anti-symmetry of the LED colors on each side of the circuit board.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Figure 3-8 also illustrates the polarity and function of the stock Xbox <span style="font-size: 1em;">LEDs. Adventurous readers are encouraged to improvise and install</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">multiple LEDs or surface-mount LED packages to try and get more</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">colors and functionality. It is possible to install LEDs that are slightly</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">larger than the T-1 package used in the Xbox by first sanding down the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">edges of the LED.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once you have double-checked the LED polarities and verified that the <span style="font-size: 1em;">short lead on both LEDs is abutting the remains of the original LED’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">center lead, solder the LEDs in place. Figure 3-10 shows the LEDs being</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">soldered in place. (If you have never soldered before, you may find it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">helpful to read Appendix B, “Soldering Techniques” before proceeding.)</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before using the soldering iron, melt a little bit of solder wire to verify that the tip is sufficiently hot. The solder wire should melt instantly if the tip is hot enough. If the soldering iron is too cold, you will not be able to form a good joint and you run the risk of damaging the circuit board.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hold the hot iron tip against the blue LED’s lead and push the lead into <span style="font-size: 1em;">the metal stub on the circuit card assembly. While the lead is heated,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">apply a touch of solder wire to the point where the blue LED lead meets</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the metal stub. The molten solder’s surface tension should cause the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">solder to wet the blue LED’s leads and the metal stub on the circuit</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">board assembly. If this does not happen, remove the iron and apply a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">little bit of flux to the joint, and try again.</span></p>

    <h2 class="calibre1 sigil_not_in_toc"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">The Anatomy of an LED</b><br/></h2>

    <p class="calibre1">LEDs, or light emitting dodes, are polarized devices, which only <span style="font-size: 1em;">allow current to flow in one direction. This means that they will</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">not work when put in backwards. Figure 3-9 illustrates the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">anatomy of an LED. The shorter lead on the side of the LED</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">package with a small flat is called the cathode. The cathode</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">must be connected to a potential more negative than the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">other lead, the anode, in order for the LED to function.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><img alt="figure_3-9" src="../Images/figure_3-9.png" style="width: 100%;"/><br/></p>

    <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-9</b>: The anatomy of an LED.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Different LEDs characteristically require a different amount of <span style="font-size: 1em;">forward voltage to turn on. Red LEDs typically require 1.7 volts,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">green LEDS require about 2.1 volts, and blue LEDs require 3.5</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">volts and up. Early blue LEDs required almost 5 volts of for</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ward voltage, but advances in technology have decreased</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">their voltage making them easier to integrate into battery-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">powered and low voltage electronics. When shopping for an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">LED for this project, be mindful of the required forward volt</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">age. If you install a 5 volt blue LED, its light output will be very</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">dim, since the maximum forward voltage generated by the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox drivers is around 3 volts.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em;">Do not hold the soldering iron tip against the metal stub for extended</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">periods of time or it will melt the solder that holds the stub in place.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">You will know that the stub’s solder joint to the board has melted, when</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the stub starts to sway freely. If this happens, hold the soldering iron tip against the board and slowly drag the soldering iron tip away. Dragging</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the tip will prevent the stub from getting pulled out of the board with the iron. Wait for the stub to cool and bend the stub back into position.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 3-10</b>: Soldering the LEDs in place. Note how the board and the LEDs are taped in place using masking tape.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once you have soldered all four connections on the two LEDs, clip off <span style="font-size: 1em;">the excess LED leads as short as you can without cutting the metal stubs.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">The finished board should look similar to Figure 3-11.</span></p>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_36"><b class="calibre3">Reassembling the Front Panel</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Snap the circuit card assembly back into the front panel by aligning the <span style="font-size: 1em;">top edges beneath the retaining clamps and pushing the card into the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">friction lock.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now, take the full front panel assembly and mate it to the Xbox. First, <span style="font-size: 1em;">feed the wire connector through the original oval-shaped hole through</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the electromagnetic interference shield. Then, push the front panel into</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Xbox, and all three friction locks should snap into place.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reattach the front panel wire connector to the Xbox motherboard. The <span style="font-size: 1em;">connector is shaped so that you can only insert it in one direction, but the plastic used in the connector molding is soft and you could insert it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">backwards if you push hard enough, possibly causing irreversible damage</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to it. Verify the correct orientation by lining up the missing pin on the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">board receptacle with the missing wire on the connector header, as shown</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">in Figure 3-12.</span><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em;">If you have an older Xbox, re-attach the vertical circuit board assembly</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">by pushing it into its sockets. This circuit board is the interface card for the Xbox game control ers, so you’l definitely want that installed</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">correctly.</span><br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now, you are ready to test your newly modified front panel assembly. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Replace the disk drives in their bays and verify that their power cable and ribbon cable connections are secure. Plug the Xbox in and you should be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">treated to a blue glow coming from the Xbox front panel. (If you don’t</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">see what you expect, don’t panic. The next section, “Debugging,” offers</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">solutions to some possible problems.)</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once you are satisfied with the modification of your Xbox, turn the <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox off and replace the four retaining screws on the front panel</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">assembly. (You wil need to remove the disk drives again to access the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">screw holes.) Replace the disk drives, power up the Xbox one more time</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to verify that everything is working fine, and then reassemble the rest of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Xbox as described in Chapter 1.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes things go wrong. In my experience, something going wrong is <span style="font-size: 1em;">more often the case than not. The most important thing to remember if</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">something doesn’t work is, don’t panic! Keep your wits together, make</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">observations about what is going wrong, and try to hypothesize the cause</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the malfunction. For your reference, Table 3-1 contains a list of common</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">problems and their possible causes. Appendix E, “Debugging: Hints and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Tips,” contains a more in-depth discussion of debugging techniques.</span></p>
