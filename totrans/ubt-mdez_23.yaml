    with a CD drive, don’t worry: You can still install Ubuntu by using a USB flash
    drive instead. Booting from a USB drive can be a little more involved than booting
    from a CD or using Wubi, but once the installer is up and running, the installation
    process is identical. I’m going to assume that you’re using Windows for the rest
    of this appendix, but it’s possible to create a USB install disk with other operating
    systems too; see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/)
    for instructions.'

    is the case, you won’t be able to use this method to install Ubuntu. Other alternative
    installation methods are available, such as downloading Wubi directly; see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/)
    for a list of options.

    the Ubuntu installer: About 2GB should do it. Make sure that you don’t have any
    files on the flash drive, either—you’ll be formatting the drive shortly, so any
    files on it will be permanently deleted. Next, you’ll need to download an Ubuntu
    CD image. If you’re feeling clever, you can use your CD-burning software to make
    an *.iso* image from the CD provided with the book, but otherwise head over to
    [http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)
    and click **Start download** to download an Ubuntu CD image. The image is large
    at around 700MB, so it might take a while to squeeze its way through your Internet
    connection.'

- en: Sometimes, large downloads don’t finish properly, and you could be left with
    an incomplete CD image. An easy (though not foolproof) way to check whether the
    image downloaded correctly is to open the folder where you saved it, right-click
    the image, and select **Properties**. Check that the size of the image file is
    *almost* 700MB (690MB, say). If it’s much lower than this, it probably didn’t
    download properly, so you’ll have to try again.

    USB drive. Use your web browser to download the Universal USB Installer from [http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/)

    find out whether you’re set up to boot from USB drives—if you get a purple Ubuntu
    boot screen, you’re all ready to go! The rest of the process will be the same
    as the usual installation from a CD, which you can read about in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Wading and Diving"). If the computer just boots back into Windows
    (or whatever operating system you’re using), you’ll need to change some settings
    to get it to boot from the flash drive. Restart the computer again and look on
    the screen for text related to the boot order or BIOS settings for your computer.
    You’ll normally have to press a key (such as delete, esc, or F2) to access these
    settings, but this very much depends on the make and model of your computer. More
    information on accessing your BIOS is given in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Wading
    and Diving").

    to boot from a USB drive (that is, make the USB drive the first boot device),
    save your changes, and restart. Ideally, you’ll now be taken to a purple Ubuntu
    boot screen. In that case, head over to [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Wading
    and Diving") and continue the installation as normal.
