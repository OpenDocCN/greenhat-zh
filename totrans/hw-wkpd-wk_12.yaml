    editors. Of course, a Wikipedia reader can come and go as he or she pleases, and
    even the most ardent Wikipedia editor abandons his or her computer from time to

    this is the fate of hundreds of articles a day, many of them well meaning.

    it contains graffiti or is un-encyclopedic, or if the topic does not seem adequately
    referenced for notability—a *red-bar* template might be added to the beginning
    of the text, nominating the article for deletion. (There are three types of deletion
    nominations, each using a different template; see [Chapter 7](hw-wkpd-wk_09.html

    for clarity, the `{{cleanup}}` tag might be added; if there are no good references,
    it is likely that the `{{unreferenced}}` tag will be placed on the article. Other
    yellow-bar templates may be more technical, for example, `{{film-fiction}}`: *This
    film-related article may fail to make a clear distinction between fact and fiction*.
    Particular criticisms of the writing standard may appear as *orange-bar* templates.
    For example, `{{wikify}}` may be added if the article could use more wikilinks.

    stubs are actively sorted by category ([Chapter 8](hw-wkpd-wk_10.html "Chapter 8. Make
    and Mend Wikipedia's Web")), this general stub template will probably be replaced
    by a more specific one. For example, `{{fairy-tale stub}}` denotes all stubs about
    fairy tales, and this tag would be an appropriate one to add to [[Gingerbread
    cottage architecture]]. One side effect of this template being added is that [[Gingerbread
    cottage architecture]] will be placed in a category with similar articles that
    still need work, such as [[List of mermaid supermodels]] and [[Great Pumpkin appearances
    in 2008]].

    a list of new articles in their subject area, so Eddie's article may be added

    be added to [[Talk:Gingerbread cottage architecture]]; though in some cases, remarks
    might be added to [[User talk:Eddie]]—let us hope politely.

    Comments may also take the form of orange-bar templates. For example, the template
    `{{NPOV}}` indicates that someone thinks the article fails to be neutral (does
    not conform to the Neutral Point of View policy). Whoever added that template
    should also add comments indicating his or her reason. Templates raising content
    issues, if not totally self-explanatory, should always be backed up by talk page
    comments that address the problem or slant in specific terms. Without such a detailed
    note, Eddie might be mystified as to what needs fixing.

    queries rather than become annoyed. Certainly simply removing a tag requesting
    some sort of clarification does an article no favors, unless the tag is entirely
    undeserved. Having a tag on an article for a while does little actual harm, and
    it is normal for content to be rewritten on Wikipedia, even if the issue raised

    like edits made by human editors; a bot is just another type of account. (A bot's

    an orphan would not be so much fun for Artie. If Eddie doesn't add links to his

    For example, the chosen title for Artie the Article, [[Gingerbread cottage architecture]],
    might be unconventional or spelled incorrectly. It is also possible that the concept
    or article title is in fact mentioned in other articles but simply has not been
    wikilinked. After creating the article, Eddie can still create links to Artie.
    Creating wikilinks will also (and subtly) draw attention to his article because
    the wikified pages are likely on the watchlists of editors already working in
    related areas. Eddie should create redirects to Artie from other possible titles,
    too.

    short-term lists of new articles, kept in the User namespace and created by analyzing

- en: Other editors produce large numbers of shorter pieces. These approaches are
    complementary, from the point of view of the encyclopedia, and suit different
    editor temperaments. What really matters is that articles are in the end written
    collectively and thoroughly. Wikipedia has no one *correct* way to write an article.

- en: The whole system for producing Wikipedia's content might seem cockeyed or random.
    It is certainly fallible. Content emerges from a complex but well-meaning development
    process, where two steps might be taken forward and then one step taken backward.
    But Wikipedia offers many layers of review and improvement, even if there is no
    single set of procedures, and ultimately Wikipedia draws readers because its content
    is, on balance, very useful. Indeed, Wikipedia's footprint on the World Wide Web
    is growing steadily.

- en: Wikipedia needs all types of articles. What should you write about? Many possibilities
    for new articles exist, but the majority of Wikipedia's two million existing articles
    still need work as well. If you want to help out with articles, you can always
    apply basic wikification and formatting ([Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html "Chapter 5. Basic
    Editing")), work on rewriting for clarity and referencing facts ([Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html
    "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research")), do cleanup tasks ([Chapter 7](hw-wkpd-wk_09.html
    "Chapter 7. Cleanup, Projects, and Processes")), sort out hypertext and category
    issues ([Chapter 8](hw-wkpd-wk_10.html "Chapter 8. Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web")),
    and perhaps even contribute images or expert syntax ([Chapter 9](hw-wkpd-wk_11.html
    "Chapter 9. Images, Templates, and Special Characters")).

- en: Good editors can often find parts of Wikipedia that are currently undeveloped,
    where new articles might be created. Just as often, many articles exist, but they
    are in poor shape and require a big structuring and linking effort. When you feel
    ready to tackle this type of work, you have mastered this part of the book. You
    can then consider yourself an advanced editor.
