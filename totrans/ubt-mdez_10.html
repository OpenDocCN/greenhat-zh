This only makes sense, because it is those two tools that turn a web-surfing, game-playing, music-churning, number-crunching box of chips into a meaningful production tool—a virtual publishing house, if you will. These devices help your computer convert digital information into hard copy (in the case of printers) and convert hard copy into digital information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising, therefore, that these tools often come together these days in the form of multifunction printers.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn how to connect these useful devices to your computer, how to set them up, and how to use them. You’ll also learn how to find and install new fonts so you can make your printed documents look their best. If you’re more into working with your digital camera than with a scanner, you might want to sneak a peek at <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Right-Brain Penguins">Chapter 13</a>; otherwise, put on your printer’s smock and read on.</p><div class="sect1" title="Printers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="printers"/>Printers</h1></div></div></div><p>Unless the only thing you use your computer for is playing games, listening to MP3s, or stopping doors on hot, breezy days, you will no doubt want to hook up your machine to a printer. Despite the paperless-office era that the personal computer was supposedly going to usher in, it seems that the computer’s strength as a desktop-publishing and general work tool has made producing high-quality printed documents an even more attractive proposition than ever before.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0001"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="confirming_that_your_printer_is_supporte"/>Confirming That Your Printer Is Supported</h2></div></div></div><p>Setting up a printer to work with your new system is a pretty easy task, and it seems that printer support in the Linux world gets better with each release. In general, support for most printers is pretty good, with only very few makes and models struggling with compatibility.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0004"/></p><p>If you really want to make sure your printer is supported, just try it by following the instructions in the next section. If you are thinking about buying a printer or are trying to decide whether to switch to Linux, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openprinting.org/printers/">http://www.openprinting.org/printers/</a>, where you can check out an online database to see whether your printer is currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers also include information on which drivers are best for your purposes. If you’re thinking of buying a printer for use with your Linux system, those manufactured by HP and Epson tend to be a pretty safe bet. You may also want to consult Ubuntu’s list at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0006"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Ubuntu to Automatically Recognize and Set Up Your Printer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_ubuntu_to_automatically_recogniz"/>Getting Ubuntu to Automatically Recognize and Set Up Your Printer</h2></div></div></div><p>Printer handling in Ubuntu is pretty much a no-brainer, because Ubuntu automatically detects most printers. If you have a USB printer, connect it to your computer and then power up the printer (vice versa should work just fine, too). If Ubuntu recognizes your printer—and chances are it will—it will be set up automatically in the background, without you needing to click a single button. The process only takes a couple of seconds, so you should be ready to print straightaway. To check that everything is hunky-dory, click the power button on the far right of the top panel and select <span class="strong"><strong>Printers</strong></span> from the menu that appears (alternatively, search for <span class="emphasis"><em>Printers</em></span> in the Dash). If your printer has been set up correctly, the Printing window will contain an icon with the make and model of your printer listed beneath it. There is nothing more for you to do in this case—your printer is set up and ready to roll.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0007"/></p><p>It is also possible, however, that Ubuntu will recognize your printer but not find a driver that is an exact match for it. In this case, a window should pop up after you connect the printer, offering a substitute driver. If you find yourself in this situation, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to print a test page to see whether the substituted driver works as it should. You can do this by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Printers</strong></span> from the top panel’s power button menu and then double-clicking your printer in the Printing window that appears. A Printer Properties window will open. Make sure that <span class="emphasis"><em>Settings</em></span> is selected from the list to the left of the window and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Print Test Page</strong></span> button (<a class="xref" href="ch10.html#printing_a_test_page_with_your_new_print" title="Figure 10-1. Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window">Figure 10-1</a>). If the test page looks normal (something like <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#an_ubuntu_printer_test_page" title="Figure 10-2. An Ubuntu printer test page">Figure 10-2</a>), everything should be fine, and you can close the Printer Properties and Printing windows.</p><div class="figure"><a id="printing_a_test_page_with_your_new_print"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e12207"/><img alt="Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263714.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-1. Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties window</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="an_ubuntu_printer_test_page"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e12215"/><img alt="An Ubuntu printer test page" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263716.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-2. An Ubuntu printer test page</p></div><p>If you have a printer that plugs into your computer’s parallel port, autodetection and setup should also work if the printer was connected when you turned on the computer.

You might also run into problems with the printer, such as streaks on printouts or jagged lines that should really be straight, so it may be necessary to clean or align the print heads too. Unfortunately, there’s no one simple method of doing this since every make of printer handles it differently. I’ll just mention a few ways you can access these options for the most common brands:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="strong"><strong>HPLIP</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>This works only for Hewlett-Packard printers.

If you’re going to all the trouble of printing something out, it’s more than likely that you want it to look <span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span>. And few things affect presentation more than your choice of font: Unless you’re a children’s entertainer, you probably won’t get far using a wacky font like Comic Sans on your résumé. Likewise, a medieval-looking gothic font would probably be wasted on that letter to your bank manager. Fortunately, your Ubuntu system comes with a wide variety of very usable and, at least to my eyes, handsome TrueType fonts. However, these tend to be a bit on the conservative side of the aesthetic spectrum, and many users will want to add a few more distinctive fonts to the system repertoire.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0030"/></p><p>Your bank manager may not appreciate that Gothic font, but you may want to print an award for an event using it. Or you might be preparing a newsletter for the local chapter of your snail-breeders society and want to use a font that is round, bubbly, and slimy. Whatever your penchant, purpose, or desire, you will probably reach a point when you want to install some other TrueType fonts on your system, so in this project I’ll tell you how to do just that.</p><p>How you install fonts depends on who is going to use them. If you have only one user account on your machine, the easiest way is to install the fonts locally, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#colon_installing_fonts_locally" title="10-2: Installing Fonts Locally">10-2: Installing Fonts Locally</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#colon_installing_fonts_locally" title="10-2: Installing Fonts Locally">10-2: Installing Fonts Locally</a>. Locally installed fonts are ones that only you or someone logged in to your user account will be able to use. On the other hand, if you have more than one user account and want the fonts to be available to all the users on your machine, you’ll need to install them globally—in this case, see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#colon_installing_truetype_fonts_globa" title="10-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally">10-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#colon_installing_truetype_fonts_globa" title="10-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally">10-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0031"/></p><div class="sect2" title="10-1: Getting the Font Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="colon_getting_the_font_files"/>10-1: Getting the Font Files</h2></div></div></div><p>The Internet is awash in free fonts.

Once you get to the FontFreak home page, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Fonts</strong></span> link under the “FREE FONTS” heading on the left side of the page. The next page will ask you whether you want to download all the free fonts on the site in one single file; click <span class="strong"><strong>No thanks, I will download them one by one</strong></span>. This will lead you to the main list of free fonts; browse through the various pages until you find one that is to your liking and then click it. Which font you download is completely up to you, but be sure to choose the PC version, not the Mac version. You can do this by clicking the small Windows icon immediately to the right of the font’s name. When the download window pops up, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Save File</strong></span> and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save the font as a Zip file. To follow along with this projec t, download a couple of fonts—I chose Aajax Surreal Freak and Accidental Presidency.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0033"/></p><p>When you’ve finished downloading, drag the font files from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloa</em></span><span class="emphasis"><em>ds</em></span> folder (or wherever you saved them) to your Home folder so it’s easy to follow along with my instructions.

One of the first areas of confusion arises from the general blurring of how the terms <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels per inch (ppi)</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>dots per inch (dpi)</em></span> are used. Most applications use these terms interchangeably, yet they aren’t really the same thing. To make things simple, when you’re talking about images on your screen, you are talking about <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span> (the little squares that make up your screen image) per inch, and when you’re talking about printer resolution, you are talking about <span class="emphasis"><em>dots</em></span> (of printer ink) per inch.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0055"/></p><p>Your computer screen generally has a resolution of 96ppi, while most modern inkjet and laser printers have a resolution range of 300 to 1200dpi or sometimes even more. This means that a photo scanned at 96ppi, which looks just fine on your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it. On the other hand, when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will look much better in your printout but will be gigantic if you display it “full size” on your screen. This is because there will be three times as many pixels per inch, so it looks three times bigger onscreen.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-10-0056"/></p><p>As an example, look at <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen" title="Figure 10-13. The same image scanned at three different resolutions">Figure 10-13</a>, where you can see an identical image scanned at three different resolutions: 96ppi, 150ppi, and 300ppi. As you can see, the 96ppi image at the far left (measuring 5 by 6 inches—about the size of the hard copy itself) is the smallest, while the other two images are proportionally bigger (about 10 by 12 inches for the 150ppi image and about 22 by 25 inches for the 300ppi image).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject10_d1e13284"/><img alt="The same image scanned at three different resolutions" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263738.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 10-13. The same image scanned at three different resolutions</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Which Resolution Should I Use When Scanning?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="which_resolution_should_i_use_when_scann"/>Which Resolution Should I Use When Scanning?</h2></div></div></div><p>Which resolution you use when scanning depends on a variety of factors, the most important of which is what you plan to do with the image when you’re finished. When I look at <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#the_same_image_scanned_at_three_differen" title="Figure 10-13. The same image scanned at three different resolutions">Figure 10-13</a> on my computer screen, the smallest image looks best, the middle image looks okay, and the largest looks a bit odd, not as sharp as the other two. Basically, when scanning images for display on a computer—on web pages, for instance—it is probably best to stick with a ppi similar to typical screen resolutions or slightly larger: 96ppi to 150ppi.</p><p>When it comes to printing, a whole new set of considerations comes into play. First, there are the limitations of your scanner, since different models have different maximum resolutions. The resolution limits of your printer are also, naturally enough, a major consideration. For example, laser printers and inkjet printers have different characteristics; laser printers will generally produce better-quality images than inkjet printers, while inkjet output will be more greatly affected by the type of paper used than a laser printer will be. Of course, your printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images at higher resolutions than those at which you plan to print them, but you will end up with a lot of files taking up too much disk space. Remember, <span class="emphasis"><em>the higher the resolution of a scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk space</em></span>. If this is of concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you’re done printing using an application such as the GIMP (more on that in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Right-Brain Penguins">Chapter 13</a>), but if you would prefer not being so cavalier with your use of disk space from the get-go, you can follow these very general guidelines:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you are using a laser printer, scan at the same resolution at which you are going to print.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you are going to use an inkjet printer with photo-quality paper, scan at about 80 percent of your target printout resolution—about 240ppi for a 300dpi printout.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you are using an inkjet printer with regular paper, scan at about 65 percent of your target printout resolution—about 195ppi for a 300dpi printout.</p></li></ul></div><p>Needless to say, these are just suggestions to get you started. What works best for you and your particular scanner/printer setup may be slightly different. Nothing works better than a bit of experimentation and trial and error. In this case, you can’t really go wrong. Just give yourself some time, don’t get frustrated, and, most importantly, don’t wait until you desperately need to scan something before trying things—stay ahead of the game.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
