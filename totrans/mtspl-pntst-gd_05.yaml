- en: Exploitation is the pinnacle of many security professionals’ careers. The ability
    to gain full control over a targeted machine is a great feeling, if perhaps a
    little scary. But even though exploitation techniques have advanced quite a bit
    over the years, the adoption of various system and network protections has made
    it increasingly more difficult to succeed with basic exploits. In this chapter,
    we move into more difficult attack methods, beginning with command-line interfaces
    to the Metasploit Framework. Most of the attacks and customizations discussed
    in this chapter will occur in *msfconsole*, *msfencode*, and *msfpayload*.

    you were introduced to basic penetration testing methods. In [Chapter 2](part0006.html#metasploit_basics)
    you learned the basics of the Framework and what to expect from each tool. In

    exploit targets (with only a portion shown in the following example). The success

- en: We began this chapter by covering the basics of exploitation and compromising
    a target based on a discovered vulnerability. Exploitation is about identifying
    a system’s potential exposures and exploiting its weaknesses. We used *nmap* to
    identify potentially vulnerable services. From there we launched an exploit that
    gave us access to a system.

    how to use it in post exploitation. You will find Meterpreter to be an amazing
    tool once you’ve compromised a system.
