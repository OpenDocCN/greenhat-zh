    know is what you're looking *at*. With an understanding of namespaces and content
    types in Wikipedia, you can easily tell whether you're looking at an article,
    a discussion page, a community page, or a user page; and once you know how to
    search and browse the site, finding articles on your topic is simple. The next
    step is assessing an article's quality.

    evaluation. If you're in a hurry, we've summarized our best clues at the end of

    the same IP address may represent different people editing, and different IPs
    may represent the same person, because Internet service providers don't always
    operate IP allocations in the simple way that telephone numbers are handed out.
    Many Internet service providers issue temporary IP addresses to their users from
    a pool of addresses, and when the user disconnects, the address is returned to
    the pool for allocation to someone else. These are known as *dynamic IPs*. (IP
    numbers that differ only in the last three places may be the same editor using
    a dynamic IP.) Furthermore, even if an IP address is fixed, it might be the IP
    for a computer in a public place, such as a library, an Internet café, or a school.
    This means, of course, that you may be seeing many people's contributions from
    the same IP address, and you cannot be sure a message left on the talk page will
    reach a particular user. IP addresses from public settings can sometimes reveal
    an extreme and baffling combination of excellent edits and vandalism. However,
    you still might be able to see that the particular edit occurred in the midst
    of a series of edits, which can help you gauge the character of whoever was at

    Furthermore, some articles are unreliable, as discussed in this section; spotting

    Misinformation can be introduced deliberately by people attempting to get a point
    of view across (which violates Wikipedia's core policy of Neutral Point of View).
    This might be done by only including a certain side of a debate, adding in and
    emphasizing controversial views, or relying on sources that only promote a certain
    point of view. Convincing misinformation can persist for a long time, especially
    in little-trafficked articles, though a close eye on the article can usually reveal
    it as suspect when it was added. Much misinformation has a distinctive slanted
    tone that is out of character with the rest of the article and other properly
    written Wikipedia articles. The Taner Akçam case involved misinformation that
    was both *vandalism* (malicious damage to site content) and *defamatory* (targeted
    at an individual's reputation).

    of the University of Minnesota was held up when traveling to Canada by border
    officials. Akçam reported that, when pressed on why he was being detained, immigration
    officials showed him a copy of his Wikipedia article from December 24, 2006, which
    had been maliciously altered to claim he was a terrorist. The immigration officials
    had placed reliance on this misinformation. See [[Taner Akçam]] for some links
    to the story and background on Akçam's work on highly controversial issues.

    information*. Articles may be completely correct but missing key aspects of the
    topic. Further information and a more complete treatment could help put the topic
    better in context, or perhaps even totally change the meaning of the information
    in the article. Because Wikipedia is built piecemeal, for an article to be missing
    some information is extremely common—and even expected. Stub articles, for instance,
    are known to be missing substantial details, but even longer or untagged articles
    may be missing parts. The only sure way to know you are getting the complete picture
    is to compare the article to other sources on the same topic.

    discredited or are otherwise outdated. The sources that editors rely on might
    be wrong or misinterpreted. Copying and pasting information is very easy to do

    that produce featured articles and good articles do guarantee attention to quality.
    *Featured articles*, which may end up on the main page, represent some of the
    best content available; however, they make up only about 0.1 percent of the total
    content of Wikipedia. Once featured, an article will have a small bronze star
    in the upper-right corner along with a note indicating this on the discussion
    page. *good articles*, which do not need to be as extensive as featured articles,
    will only include a note on the talk page. (See [[Wikipedia:Featured articles]]
    and [[Wikipedia:Good articles]] to browse collections of these articles.)
  prefs: []

    articles within a certain topic area; these ratings typically don't require consensus
    but instead reflect an individual editor's opinion of the article, based on set
    standards. Most rating projects have been organized by WikiProjects that focus
    on a particular topic area (for instance, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry]],
    which was one of the first to rate articles). If you're using Wikipedia for research
    on a particular topic, you may be fortunate enough to find that basic article
    rating is well advanced in your area of interest. Most of the rating systems amount
    to saying, *On a scale of 1 to 5, where is this article?* Any rating notices will
    be placed on the article talk page.

    six classifications to rate articles: *stub, start, B, A, good article*, and *featured
    article* (which is reserved for articles that have gone through the featured article
    process). This editorial classification is also adopted by some WikiProjects.
