- en: Apache HTTP Server is an open source web server application regarded as one
    of the most efficient, scalable, and feature-rich web servers available. Apache
    is also highly customizable, with numerous third-party modules available to extend
    its functionality. You'll find modules that add support for SSL (Secure Sockets
    Layer) encryption over HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), PHP support (PHP is
    a server-side scripting language), and authentication support for password protecting
    a site or page.

- en: Apache was born at the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications)
    in 1993 when Rob McCool developed a public domain HTTP daemon (background process)
    that would later become the foundation of the Apache project. Apache version 1.3
    still contains code from the original NCSA-developed HTTP daemon, while version
    2 was rewritten from scratch and contains no NCSA code.
