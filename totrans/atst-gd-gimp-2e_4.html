GIMP can’t help you rein in your media costs or identify your target audience, but it can help you present a compelling product message. The tutorials in this chapter utilize GIMP tools you’ve already encountered in this book, building on skills you’ve developed and teaching you how to apply those skills to common advertising tasks.</p><div class="sect1" title="Print vs. Web"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="print_vsdot_web"/>Print vs. Web</h1></div></div></div><p>An advertisement’s destination dictates its design. Understanding the requirements and limitations of the destination medium is an important part of the advertising design process. Creating web ads doesn’t require as much time, effort, or computer memory as creating print ads, but the nature of the Web limits advertising in many ways.</p><p><a id="iddle1036" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1703" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1972" class="indexterm"/>Web ads are designed to be viewed on computer monitors, so the images are usually small and measured at the monitor’s resolution, typically 72 or 98 ppi. Web ads are also displayed in the same RGB format in which the images were created. For these reasons, they’re a bit easier to create than print ads, but because the monitor resolution and screen space are limited, web ads can’t show as much detail.</p><p>In comparison, print ads are usually larger and measured at higher resolutions (150 dpi to 300 dpi), which require far more computer memory to produce. Additionally, print ads created in RGB generally must be converted to the CMYK format the printer requires. Because GIMP doesn’t currently support direct manipulation of images in CMYK, your ads will be created in RGB, and the conversion process will have to be handled by the printer or a third-party service bureau.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you’re not afraid of the command line, you can also try using the ImageMagick suite of command-line tools to handle image color conversion. If RGB images are built with the Little CMS (LCMS) library, the Convert tool can convert them to CMYK using International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles. Your personal printer probably has ICC profile files, and GIMP supports their use even if it doesn’t work directly with CMYK color.</em></span></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Stock Images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="stock_images"/>Stock Images</h1></div></div></div><p>Most web and print advertising work starts with stock images. Luckily, the Internet has opened up stock image collections to the masses and reduced the cost of those images in the process. These images are ideal for use in web ads because they’re inexpensive, of reasonable quality, and available in many sizes. Most stock image collections provide images in GIMP-supported formats such as TIFF and JPEG, and prices on low-cost stock image websites like BigStockPhoto.com, iStockphoto.com, and CanStockPhoto.com range from $1 to $5 per image.</p><p>You can use low-cost stock images for some print ads, though for projects like posters and banners it may be best to use images from professional stock image collections instead. Professional stock image services usually offer much larger images, ones that are big enough to suit large-scale print projects. In addition to per-file downloads, professional stock image services may also sell complete CD collections or provide monthly subscriptions. Prices vary greatly, however. A single image might cost $80 to $200, while a CD collection might cost around $500. Websites like ThinkStockPhotos.com and GettyImages.com charge approximately $199 per month and $1,200 per year for subscriptions.</p><p>Online stock image collections typically offer each image in a few different sizes. These image sizes are generally given in pixels, and you’ll want to buy the largest version of the image you can afford. This will allow you to scale down the image to a size appropriate for your project. Remember that the dots per inch (dpi) value for print ads (150 dpi to 300 dpi) is different from pixels per inch (ppi) for web ads (72 ppi or 98 ppi). An image that is 1,200 pixels wide is 4 inches wide when printed at 300 dpi for a magazine (300 dpi × 4 inches = 1,200 pixels), but it’s over 16½ inches wide when printed at 72 dpi for the Web!</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note02"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In practice, there is no difference between dpi and ppi; both are references to points of color per inch. Dpi is generally used in printing, whereas ppi is used for monitors.</em></span></p></div><p>Another issue to consider when using stock images is licensing. Many low-cost stock image collections license all of their images for a wide range of uses, but some allow each photographer to specify his or her own license parameters. Professional stock image services have very specific licensing policies. You’ll need to read the licenses carefully to determine whether or not you can use the image as you’d like.</p><p>The issue of model releases is also tricky. A <span class="emphasis"><em>model release</em></span> is written permission to use the likeness of a person, place, or identifying mark (such as a logo) that might otherwise have limited rights of use. Model releases are most often used in connection with photos of people and are required if the individual’s face is recognizable.</p><p><a id="iddle1024" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1169" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1211" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1238" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1539" class="indexterm"/>Most stock image websites require that anyone submitting a photo of a person also include a model release giving permission to use the likeness in other projects. A model release allows a designer to use a stock image for a wide range of purposes but protects the model’s image from misuse.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note03"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A very detailed guide to model releases is available at</em></span> <a class="ulink" href="http://www.danheller.com/model-release.html">http://www.danheller.com/model-release.html</a>.</p></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00265a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00265"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223110.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Most advertising projects make use of stock photos.</em></span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Color, Contrast, and Grayscale"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="colorcomma_contrastcomma_and_grayscale"/>Color, Contrast, and Grayscale</h1></div></div></div><p>Flip through any glossy trade magazine, and you’ll see how color and contrast are used effectively in print advertising. GIMP offers several tools for enhancing existing colors, among them the Curves, Levels, and Hue-Saturation tools. Each of these can be used to add pizzazz to an image or to alter an image’s mood. The Brightness-Contrast tool is often used in conjunction with these other tools to make overall ambient lighting changes.</p><p>While color grabs the viewer’s attention, you can choose Colors▸Desaturate to remove color from an image, leaving just contrasting white, black, and gray to achieve a subtler effect. The level of contrast in a grayscale image sets the mood: a high-contrast grayscale image conveys energy, while a softly blurred grayscale image evokes a feeling of calm and lends the subject a sense of style and class. GIMP offers many tools for controlling contrast in grayscale images, including numerous layer and tool blend modes.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00266a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00266"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223112.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Use the Curves tool to increase contrast and achieve more dramatic lighting effects.</em></span></p></div></div></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note04"/>Note</h3><p><a id="iddle1541" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Used in this context,</em></span> grayscale <span class="emphasis"><em>is not the same as the Grayscale mode (Image</em></span>▸<span class="emphasis"><em>Mode</em></span>▸<span class="emphasis"><em>Grayscale). In Grayscale mode an image has no color content, because it only has a gray channel. In the case of desaturated RGB images, the color content has been removed, but because the image is still in RGB mode, color can be added back in.</em></span></p></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00267a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00267"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223114.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lighting plays an important role in advertising, whether the images are color or grayscale.</em></span></p></div></div></div><p>There’s another reason to consider desaturating images with GIMP: you can add color back in at any time—any color you choose. Colorizing a desaturated image is one more way to set the mood for an advertisement. A range of blues can be cold and harsh, while rich reds and yellows are warm and energetic.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00268a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00268"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223116.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Desaturated images (like the one on the left) are RGB images where the Saturation is set to 0.

The tutorials in this chapter are less about learning new techniques than they are about practicing what you’ve already learned. Tutorials elsewhere in this book show you how to create 3-D images and reflections or enhance color and lighting. Try applying these techniques to stock photographs and you’ll soon find that in the hands of a creative designer, the possibilities are endless.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="4.1 Creative Text Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="fourdot1_creative_text_design"/>4.1 Creative Text Design</h1></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00269a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00269"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223118.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><a id="iddle1027" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2008" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>The ordinary becomes extraordinary, with a little help from GIMP.</em></span></p></div></div></div><p>GIMP is first and foremost a tool for working with raster images. Most desktop users will prefer to work with GIMP when dealing with their digital photographs but might choose other tools like Inkscape or Scribus when working with text. Yet GIMP does a great job with text effects in ways that people might think can only be done with those vector applications.</p><p>In this tutorial I’ll walk you through a little text trick I stumbled upon in a design magazine. The goal of the project is to map an image onto text but keep the original image recognizable. In the original magazine article, the process was handled using Adobe InDesign, a vector layout tool. It does clever things with text using boxes to align and block objects within the layout. Fortunately, this particular effect turns out to be even easier to produce with GIMP than with InDesign.</p><p>Projects like this have important periphery components beyond just the text. This design requires a source image with sufficient color and contrast. Without color and contrast, the shapes within the image won’t be recognizable through the text.</p><p>The project also requires a suitable font. The font should be thick and without any serifs. Serif fonts clutter the final image and in most cases won’t allow as much detail from the source image to be displayed, even when bold versions of the serif font are used. Serif fonts can also make text from the image difficult to recognize.</p><p>GIMP’s text features make actual design possible in a few minutes, with a limited sequence of steps. Before diving in, take a look at some of those periphery issues.</p><div class="sect2" title="Selecting a Stock Image"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="selecting_a_stock_image"/>Selecting a Stock Image</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1025" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1028" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1030" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1432" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1640" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1663" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1973" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2006" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2009" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2011" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2045" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2114" class="indexterm"/>To start the project, select an appropriate portrait from one of the many stock image sites on the Internet. The one in this tutorial comes from BigStockPhoto.com. The picture should ideally include two important features. The first is a solid-colored background. A multicolored or otherwise cluttered background makes it harder to isolate the subject of the image when you apply your text effect.</p><p>The second important feature is color contrast. An all-black image would work but would end up being mere shadow-filled text. For this project, I selected a woman in a black dress with enough skin tones to provide some color contrast. Later you’ll add to that contrast with a soft vignette.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Choosing a Font"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="choosing_a_font"/>Choosing a Font</h2></div></div></div><p>This effect works best with thick, straight-edged fonts (script fonts don’t show the image well, even when boldface type is used).

There are many ways to use GIMP to simulate three dimensions. The most common method uses drop shadows to simulate a light source and add a sense of depth. But drop shadows only place one plane above another. They can’t add depth to the image itself.</p><p>Fortunately, light and shadows aren’t the only tricks available to GIMP users. You can also play with perspective. The Perspective tool in GIMP’s toolbox provides a simple interface that allows you to change the direction from which an object is viewed; for example, you might choose to view the image head-on or to rotate it and view it at an angle. If you need to use 3-D packages in your designs, it’s best to get familiar with the Perspective tool.</p><p>In this tutorial you’ll create a 3-D product package for a fictitious mobile phone manufacturer. You take a set of images, arrange them to form the front and sides of the box, align the sides, and then angle the box away from the viewer. As is often the case, you’ll save a lot of time if you choose stock images wisely. The actual layout and perspective changes are relatively simple tricks that bring the stock images to life.</p><p>This project is scaled for use on the Web, which generally uses 98 ppi for images.

If you want to get your message across, you’ll need to establish the <span class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> quickly. A logo is the centerpiece of a corporate identity, and it can do a lot to increase name recognition. While logo designs themselves are often quite simple, they can be placed near or inside other objects for added effect. Glass can reflect a company’s identity in a big way.</p><p>Glass effects are really just tricks with lighting and shadows. In previous tutorials you used lighting to simulate depth in an image. Shadows, too, provide a sense of depth by implying that another surface exists behind or below the main subject. Reflections can also be used to lend texture to a surface. In this tutorial you’ll learn how to use reflections to simulate a rounded, glassy surface.</p><p>This technique is easy to learn, but you may need to experiment to get the reflections just right. The trick is to create cutouts from an existing selection. And notice the use of paths in this tutorial—the two endpoints of a path will be connected when they are converted to a selection, and in this tutorial you want the line between those two endpoints to be outside an existing selection.</p><div class="sect2" title="Getting Started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_started-id00037"/>Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><p>To make sure that the default colors are being used, press <span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span> in the canvas area to reset the foreground and background colors.

While printed symbols are often easier (and cheaper) to create in solid colors, designing for the Web allows a bit more flexibility. Color is king on the Web, and because high-resolution, 16M-color monitors are the norm, three-dimensional effects are equally widespread.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00311a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00311"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223202.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Even a solitary letter can benefit from reflective techniques.</em></span></p></div></div></div><p>Symbols play an important role in design, and they can make or break a product or company image—better known in the graphic arts industry as an <span class="emphasis"><em>identity</em></span>. The symbol itself may be flat and solid, flat and textured, or three-dimensional with light effects and shadows. Visual identities are the symbols of the companies we know—just think about McDonald’s Golden Arches, a Red Hat for Linux, or IBM’s Big Blue.</p><p>Logos usually include text set in a specific font, which is often accompanied by a shape representing the company, group, or individual. As part of an overall identity campaign, logos are sometimes embedded within other shapes to create emblems.</p><p>One of the easiest emblems to create is a round, reflective logo that resembles glass. A glass logo uses soft gradients with little or no grain visible. Many white ovals (or partial ovals) are layered and placed over the logo to simulate reflections. Sometimes these round reflections are even outlined with distinct edges to simulate a frame in which the logo is set.</p><p>A metallic logo is even easier to create. The technique is based on the fact that reflections in metal aren’t as wide as reflections in glass, and they have more high-contrast areas between light and shadow. In the case of a metallic logo, the metal might be the focal point—as in a belt buckle or lapel pin—or you might just use metallic edges to accent a nonmetallic design, which is what you’ll do in this tutorial.</p><div class="sect2" title="Getting Started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_started-id00042"/>Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><p>When you’re designing these emblems, it helps to examine real-world objects like glass buttons or even silver spoons. Notice how the light and colors reflect. One trick is to blur your eyes a little—try to see the reflections without focusing on the shape of the object. Then try to reproduce the effect with GIMP.</p><p>Adding reflectivity and color not only adds style to your design, it’s also incredibly easy to do with GIMP. In this tutorial you’ll work on a small canvas to demonstrate the ease of the technique. Remember that raster images—like those you create in GIMP—don’t scale up to larger sizes very well, so start with a larger canvas and scale up the <span class="emphasis"><em>technique</em></span> if you need a bigger emblem.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Creating a Metallic Border"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_a_metallic_border"/>Creating a Metallic Border</h2></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>With the toolbox selected, press <span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span> to reset the foreground and background colors to black and white, respectively.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>.

But photo editing is only half a story, like a wine glass with no wine. To get the whole story, you need the wine bottle: graphics created from scratch using GIMP’s vector tools.</p><p>This tutorial shows you how to draw using nothing but guides, a grid, and paths. Guides are straight lines that allow you to accurately position points, bound selections, or simply trace with drawing tools. Paths are vector components of an image that can be edited anytime to change their shapes using control points and drag handles. Path edits don’t immediately affect the image window; you have to retrace the paths or convert them to selections for use in the image.</p><p>Paths are to drawing what layers are to photo editing. You create multiple paths in a single path layer and then create multiple path layers to create a drawing. Since paths are editable curves, not just straight lines, they’re perfect for drawing manga or other types of cartoons. But there’s more to paths than cartoons. You’re going to use them as the basis for a 3-D shape.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00323a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00323"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1223226.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We’ve done surface reflections.

You start by crafting image pieces by hand or from stock photography, which you later combine as layers into your final draft.

You’ll start this project by creating 32 uniformly spaced cogs around a circle. Later you’ll connect the cogs with metallic rings, and then you’ll finish off the project by adding depth to give the whole gear a 3-D appearance.</p><p>The process for the cogs is so simple, I’ll explain it before you even start. You create a single cog at the top of a square canvas window in a layer by itself. You duplicate the layer and rotate it 90 degrees. Then you merge the duplicate with the original. Repeat this once to end up with cogs positioned at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock. Then repeat the process but halve the rotation amount. Each successive repetition halves the rotation again. Now you can see this process in action.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open a new image and set the Width and Height to <span class="strong"><strong>480 pixels</strong></span>.

Of course, what flows outside the visible edge of the canvas won’t be included in the final image, but that’s a design choice.</p><p>The shadow in this project didn’t flow to the image borders, but there’s no reason it couldn’t. In fact, adjusting the shadow provides a very specific feel to the design because it lets the viewer know the direction from where the light is shining.</p><p>You can splash a little color into this by adding color to the white background.

Zoom out to view the edges of a layer extending beyond the canvas area. A few jaggies along the edge of a package where the front and side images meet may not be such a bad thing—they can provide contrast to show there’s an actual edge where common colors blend.
