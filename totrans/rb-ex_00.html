It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-1" id="PREF-00-FNOTE-1">1</a>]</sup> It was released in 1995 by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. It is often described as either a very high-level language or a scripting language, depending on whom you ask. As such, it doesn’t require a programmer to specify the details of how the computer implements your decisions. Like other high-level languages, Ruby is often used in text-processing applications, including an increasing number of web applications. I hope that once you’ve become more acquainted with the language, you’ll agree that it does a good job of getting out of your way and simply letting you get some work done.</p><p>Ruby has a very interesting pedigree. Matz himself has said that the two most influential languages on Ruby’s design were Common Lisp and Smalltalk—they were so influential, in fact, that he has jokingly referred to Ruby as <span class="emphasis"><em>MatzLisp</em></span>. On the other hand, some Ruby aficionados stress Ruby’s similarities with Smalltalk and Perl, as did David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Rails, in a June 2006 <em class="citetitle">Linux Journal</em> interview. Hansson also describes Ruby as “a language for writing beautiful code that makes programmers happy.” I couldn’t agree more.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-2" id="PREF-00-FNOTE-2">2</a>]</sup></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-1"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you’re interested in learning more about Ruby’s heritage, see the appendix for a comparison of Ruby to other languages</em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Acquiring and Configuring Ruby"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="acquiring_and_configuring_ruby"/>Acquiring and Configuring Ruby</h1></div></div></div><p>But enough with the history—let’s set these questions aside and actually get Ruby installed. It’s flexible, expressive, and released under a free software/open source license. (The license is available online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/license.txt">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/license.txt</a>.)</p><div class="sect2" title="On a Unix or Unix-like System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="on_a_unix_or_unix-like_system"/>On a Unix or Unix-like System</h2></div></div></div><p>Users of Unix-like operating systems such as Mac OS X, the BSDs, and GNU/Linux variants have it easy. Many of these systems either come with Ruby pre-installed or make it available as a very convenient package.</p><p>If Ruby came pre-installed on your computer, it will probably include the Interactive Ruby Shell (irb) that we’ll use in the next chapter. If you’ve installed Ruby with a package manager, irb may come in a separate package, possibly with a specific version number as a part of the package name.</p><p>If your package manager does not include Ruby or if you’d like to use a more up-to-date version than what your package manager offers, you can simply browse to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">http://www.ruby-lang.org</a> and click the Download Ruby link. Download the current stable release (1.8.4 at the time of this writing), which is a .tar.gz file. Then type the following commands as the superuser, also called <code class="literal">root</code>. (I’ll assume you’re using version 1.8.4, although it will probably be a later version when you download Ruby.)</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e172"/><pre class="programlisting">cp ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz /usr/local/src/
cd /usr/local/src
tar -xzf ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.8.4</pre><p>Then follow the instructions in the README file. The usual set of commands for installation is as follows.</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e176"/><pre class="programlisting">./configure
make
make install</pre><p>You should now have a working version of Ruby. You can test this by executing this command:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e180"/><pre class="programlisting">ruby --version</pre><p>If it reports <code class="literal">ruby 1.8.4 (2005-12-24) [i486-linux]</code> or whichever version you downloaded and your system, everything worked.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-3" id="PREF-00-FNOTE-3">3</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="On a Windows System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="on_a_windows_system"/>On a Windows System</h2></div></div></div><p>If you use a Windows system, a One-Click Ruby Installer is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl</a>. Simply follow the instructions there to download Ruby for your system. It’s a comprehensive package—check the site for the most up-to-date list of its contents. At the time of this writing, it included the base language with various popular extensions, including SciTE (a syntax-highlighting text editor), FreeRIDE (a Ruby development environment), a help file containing Dave Thomas’ book <em class="citetitle">Programming Ruby</em> (also called The Pickaxe), and the RubyGems package installer. It also comes with irb, which we’ll explore in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Interactive Ruby and the Ruby Environment">Chapter 1</a>.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#PREF-00-FNOTE-1" id="ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-1">1</a>] </sup>According to <a class="ulink" href="http://ruby-lang.org">http://ruby-lang.org</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#PREF-00-FNOTE-2" id="ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-2">2</a>] </sup>For more on Ruby’s ancestry, refer to the Ruby-Talk archives (<a class="ulink" href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642">http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642</a>) and O’Reilly’s interview with Matz (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html</a>).</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#PREF-00-FNOTE-3" id="ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-3">3</a>] </sup>Ruby, like most open source languages, is under constant development.

Ruby version 1.8.6 was released slightly before this book came out.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Motivations for the Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="motivations_for_the_book"/>Motivations for the Book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book tries to be both useful in the immediate term and informative in the long term. These goals have a profound impact on how the book is organized.</p><p>It’s also meant to be accessible to neophytes, but it focuses on programming paradigms and their impact on both language design and language use—topics common to academic programming books. These days, you can use any popular language for most tasks, but that doesn’t mean that solving a given problem will be equally painless in every language. No language exists in a vacuum, and a discussion of a language like Ruby should acknowledge the decisions that went into its design. You’ll find that it’s a very flexible language that lets you combine different approaches in powerful ways. Biologists recognize hybrid vigor; so did Matz when he created Ruby.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-2"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When I mention programming paradigms, I’m referring to three main types: imperative, object-oriented, and functional.
