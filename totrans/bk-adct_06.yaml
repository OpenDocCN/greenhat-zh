    of playback devices, and audio quality is excellent even on inexpensive CD players.

    just an ordinary computer DVD writer and blank DVD media. You do need special
    authoring software to create the correct type of DVD disk image, and you have
    to use PCM-type audio file formats such as FLAC, WAV, and AIFF. I like FLAC because
    it’s an open, high-quality lossless, compressed format that creates files that

    formats used in DVD movies but is a different format just for audio. DVD movies
    use various compressed, lossy audio formats to preserve disk space, which even
    on a DVD is at a premium when you combine movie-length video and multichannel
    surround sound. DVD-Audio supports professional studio master audio quality, which
    is 24/192\. If you’re content with CD audio (16/44.1 stereo), you can cram about
    seven hours’ worth onto a single standard 4.7GB DVD. At 24/192, you’ll get about
    75 minutes of music on a standard DVD. Some DVD-authoring software supports writing
    to 8.5GB double-layer DVDs, so you can really pile in the tunes. The DVD-Audio

    16/48 on the surround channels. You need compression to get higher resolution
    for 5.1, and the only compression supported by the DVD-Audio standard is the proprietary
    Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) lossless compression. A license for MLP is expensive,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Audacity documentation recommends recording at 32-bit float and then downsampling
    to your desired bit depth for your final export. So even though your final product
    is 24 or 16 bit, starting from 32-bit float results in higher quality than recording
    in 24- or 16-bit integer. This is true even if your recording interface supports
    only 16 bits. You will always downsample because there are no 32-bit playback
    devices; you must always export to 24-bit or lower integer (also called *linear*)
    formats. 32-bit float is always an intermediate step, not the final result.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s talk about what 32-bit float is, since it is rather misunderstood. Integers
    are whole numbers, and *float* means floating decimal point. A 32-bit float number
    is a 24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. 32-bit float means great precision
    and very high resolution. You get a smoother, more accurate response curve across
    the whole range of your analog-to-digital conversion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bit depth controls dynamic range, and in audio production dynamic range is very
    important. Each bit equals about 6 dB dynamic range. So, 16-bit has a dynamic
    range of 96 dB, 24-bit is 144 dB, and 32-bit float is about 1,500 dB; 32-bit integer
    is 196 dB. There are limitations in electronic hardware that limit actual dynamic
    range to a maximum of about 120 dB, and most people don’t care to listen to music
    with a dynamic range greater than 50 dB, which is quite a lot. So what’s the point
    of having very wide dynamic range? The value of all that dynamic range is abundant
    headroom for editing, lowest noise, less risk of clipping, and lossless exports
    to lower bit depths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those extra eight bits make all the difference when you’re doing a lot of manipulation
    and effects. You can mangle your 32-bit files to your heart’s content and when
    you’re finished make a lossless 24-bit export. If you started from a 24-bit file,
    applied a lot of processing, and finished with a 24-bit export, you would likely
    introduce some noise and experience some loss of quality.

- en: We dinosaurs from the analog era have a habit of pushing recording levels as
    close to the red line as possible, because there were good reasons for doing so.
    Even the best analog tapes and recorders created a bit of hiss and had a relatively
    narrow dynamic range, so we had to push the limits of signal to noise to minimize
    this. Going a bit over the red line didn’t matter very much with analog audio
    because it was a gradual effect—at +2 or +3 the distortion was bothersome only
    to the fussiest of listeners. At +4 or +5 you were a cool rock band. In digital
    audio it’s all or nothing—when a signal passes 0 dB, everything over zero is discarded,
    or clipped. You might hear an audible click or something similar to the familiar
    analog distortion buzz. It’s easy to hear for yourself. Just plug in a mic, crank
    up the gain, and talk loudly. Or use **Generate** > **Tone** to create a sine
    wave, and then use **Effect** > **Amplify** to crank it way up over zero. You
    can find clipped segments easily by selecting **View** > **Show Clipping**, which
    uses red bars to mark clipped passages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some documentation says that recording at 32-bit float means virtually no distortion,
    even if you go over 0 dB. But there are several variables that affect any sounds
    that go over 0 dB, mainly the software processing your sounds. Different Audacity
    plug-ins, or any other software that you might use, will process sounds over 0
    dB in different ways, so you could still get clipping and create distortion. It’s
    not necessary to push your recording levels that high anyway since you have dynamic
    range to burn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The short story is that the 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit depths all offer more
    dynamic range than you’ll ever be able to use, so you’ll have plenty of headroom
    with any of them. When you’re recording at 24-bit depth, you can handily afford
    to throw away the top 12 dB. At 16 bits you can set your peaks to -6 or -9 dB
    and have no worries. Audacity’s 32-bit float means you can record to a peak of
    -24 dB, which is helpful at a live show to allow for unexpected peaks.

    If you have enough computer power and storage, recording at 32-bit float with

    You can always go downward, but you can’t go upward. On the other hand, if you
    are careful and skilled, all the links in your audio chain are good quality, and
    your own ears are pleased with the results, then lower resolutions are plenty

    As we learned in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish"),
    sampling rates determine frequency range. The frequency range is about half the
    sampling rate. The best human hearing has a range of about 20 Hz to 22 kHz, so
    a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz should cover the range of human hearing. The better
    audio hardware has an upper limit of 20 to 30 kHz.

    frequencies are still perceived in some manner and add to the listener’s enjoyment.
    What they might be talking about are the harmonics. If you have a sound at 100
    Hz, there are harmonics of that sound at 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 200 Hz, and so on. When
    you limit the frequency range, you also limit the harmonics.

    best quality. Don’t upsample, because all that does is add bits without adding

    the mixer settings. Follow the example in [Figure 6-5](ch06s03.html#mapping_six-channel_discrete_surround_to
    "Figure 6-5. Mapping six-channel discrete surround to stereo") to map six channels
    to two stereo channels, first making sure the output slider is set to two channels.
    Tracks can be mapped to more than one channel.

    to 16\. This is set in the **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Quality** > **High-quality
    Conversion** drop-down menus. Dither is deliberately adding noise to smooth the
    rough edges for a cleaner sound. *Shaped* dither is considered to give the best
    results, but it is also the most CPU-intensive. *Triangular* is a good compromise
    between quality and CPU cost, and *rectangular* is lightweight and makes the smallest
    alterations. Dithering isn’t needed on 24-bit files, though I won’t complain if
    you want to experiment and hear for yourself.

    a disk image, so you’ll need to burn the disk with your usual favorite DVD-writing

    as ordinary old-fashioned DVD burners, which is $50 or less, and you can burn

    Media) to CD"), we learned how to convert legacy analog media to digital formats.
    Tapes and vinyl records require jumping through some extra hardware hoops to get
    everything connected. CDs and DVDs are easier, because you can do everything on
    your computer. First copy the CD, DVD, or legacy media to your computer. The popular
    term for copying CDs and DVDs is *ripping*, and this is done with special, easily
    obtained software. Some good DVD rippers for Linux are K9copy, dvd::rip, and VLC.
    You need *libdvdcss* to rip encoded DVDs. libdvdcss is available in many Linux
    distributions and should be easy to find.

    and free of cost, and it has the most features. With VLC you can extract and transcode
    your DVD-Audio tracks into almost any format.

    FLAC is appropriate for most DVD-Audio tracks. It makes a perfect copy and saves

    them as 32-bit float WAV masters to give yourself some headroom for future editing.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Music lovers are always asking “What about Sony/Phillips’s Super Audio CD (SACD)?”
    SACD is not an option for the home or small studio because the recorders are very
    expensive, plus you must pay format license and patent fees, which is a shame,
    because it’s a real breakthrough. SACD takes one-bit samples at a 2.82 MHz sampling
    rate. That’s right, 2.82 million times per second. That is a tad more than the
    standard Red Book CD sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. On paper, it’s closer to an analog
    waveform than any other digital format. SACD does not use pulse code modulation
    (PCM) but a new method of recording and playback that is called Direct Stream
    Digital (DSD). PCM requires interpolation and oversampling filters, while DSD
    employs a more direct, less-complex signal path. SACD has a potential dynamic
    range of around 100 dB.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems that vendors of both SACD and DVD-Audio became bogged down in DRM nonsense,
    rather than marketing these high-quality formats in a pleasing and attractive
    manner, so both have been slow to gain traction in the marketplace. I think they
    are both going to fade away eventually.
