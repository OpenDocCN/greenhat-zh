    But often, what you need is not “any” shape but some very simple and well-defined
    geometric entity, such as a rectangle. Of course, a four-node path will give you
    a perfect rectangle—but isn’t there a faster and more convenient way to do that,
    specifically for rectangles?

    geometric shapes: rectangles, 3D boxes, ellipses, polygons, stars, and spirals.
    Each shape type has a corresponding creation tool; it also provides an array of
    numeric parameters, draggable handles, and shortcuts for manipulating these shapes.
    You cannot do “everything” to such a shape object, but what you *can* do to it
    makes perfect sense for that specific shape type.'

    of nature, and randomness in design is a great way to make shapes livelier and
    less rigid. Your artistic sense and experience will tell you where and how much
    randomness is appropriate. In Inkscape, there are many sources of artistic randomness;
    you can easily shuffle the positions of objects (**[7.5.1 Randomizing, Unclumping,
    and Removing Overlaps](ch07s05.html#sevendot5dot1_randomizingcomma_unclumpin "7.5.1

    placement, scaling, and rotation (**[10.8.2 Editing Patterns](ch10s08.html#one0dot8dot2_editing_patterns

    distort them (**[12.6.6 Roughen Mode](ch12s06.html#one2dot6dot6_roughen_mode "12.6.6
    Roughen Mode")**). Still, randomized stars are unique in how fast and easy it
    is to draw a shape where intrinsic symmetry emphasizes its randomness.

    randomization produces a variety of wild and unpredictable shapes. Messy hairballs,
    rounded amoeba-like ink blotches, fantastic landscapes at the edge of a large
    star with many vertices and spoke ratio close to 1—all this and more is possible

    the curve without affecting its shape.
