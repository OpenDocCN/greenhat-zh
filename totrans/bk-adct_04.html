    you can use Audacity to prepare your tracks for copying to a CD.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Suppose you have some long tracks recorded in the studio or from a
    live performance. You might want to split them into individual songs or
    cut out material between songs and knit them together to sound like one
    long, unbroken live track. Maybe you’re cutting and pasting the best of
    several different recording sessions. Perhaps you have multitrack
    recordings that need to be downmixed to two-channel stereo for CD. You
    want to clean it all up and make it sound as good as possible.</p><p>Recording live shows is challenging. I’ll talk about several
    different ways to do this, from inexpensive and easy to more expensive
    with ultimate control over the final mix. Then we’ll move on to using
    Audacity to prepare your recordings for CD.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please review <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> if

      learned about putting together a recording studio and how to turn your
      computer into a digital audio workstation. Making good live recordings
      is harder than making good studio recordings because so many things are
      out of your control. However, that’s okay, because you’re not
      necessarily after some sort of technical perfection but rather capturing
      the excitement and energy.</p><p>Getting good two-channel stereo recordings is pretty easy, because
      nearly all audio equipment supports two-channel stereo. If you want
      multichannel recordings of live shows (for more control of the mix),
      then you’ll need more expensive equipment.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One of the biggest potential hurdles relates to who controls the
      venue’s sound system. If it is you, then you can do whatever you want.
      If the performers or venue have their own system and technicians, then
      you’ll need their cooperation.</p><p>Remember to record some audience noise in case you need to add a
      bit more live flavor. You should also record a few minutes’ worth of
      various background and audience noises to use later for noise removal.
      You want good samples of noise not mixed with music, or anything you
      want to keep, for best noise removal.</p><div class="sect2" title="Portable Digital Recorder"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="portable_digital_recorder"/>Portable Digital Recorder</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="the_zoom_h2_on_a_microphone_stand"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e5752"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797507.png.jpg" alt="The Zoom H2 on a microphone stand."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-1. The Zoom H2 on a microphone stand.</p></div><p>A little portable digital recorder just might surprise you with
        how well it can capture a live performance. The Zoom H2, which is my
        favorite compact digital recorder, has four built-in microphones. You
        can use either the front pair or rear pair or all four at once to
        create a spatial, three-dimensional sound. The Zoom comes with a
        little stand to put it on any flat surface and a handle that fits into
        a mic stand so you can easily position it anywhere (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#the_zoom_h2_on_a_microphone_stand" title="Figure 4-1. The Zoom H2 on a microphone stand.">Figure 4-1</a>). It’s unobtrusive and
        even looks like an old-fashioned microphone.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Zoom has a 1/8″ stereo line input, which means you can
        connect it directly to a mixer. Usually in live shows all instruments
        and vocalists are connected to a single sound console, and even the
        most low-budget console should have a pair of stereo RCA recording
        outputs. The Zoom uses a two-RCA-to-1/8″ stereo TRS adapter, as shown
        in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#zoom_h2_with_a_two-rca-to-1_solidus_8p_s" title="Figure 4-2. Zoom H2 with a two-RCA-to-1/8″ stereo adapter for connecting to a mixing console">Figure 4-2</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="zoom_h2_with_a_two-rca-to-1_solidus_8p_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e5779"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797509.png.jpg" alt="Zoom H2 with a two-RCA-to-1/8″ stereo adapter for connecting to a mixing console"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-2. Zoom H2 with a two-RCA-to-1/8″ stereo adapter for connecting
          to a mixing console</p></div><p>Whatever you hear through headphones connected to a monitoring
        port on the sound board is how your recording will sound, so ideally
        there will be a good person at the sound board keeping all the
        channels balanced and sounding good. Because everything is already
        mixed down to two channels, your editing options are limited, so it
        needs to be right during recording.</p><p>The Zoom also has a USB 1.1 port to connect to your computer, so
        you can record directly to your computer if you prefer, rather than
        recording to the Zoom’s SD storage card.</p><p>You don’t have to use the Zoom H2 just because I like it—there
        are dozens of different great portable digital recorders to choose
        from, with all kinds of feature sets.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Laptop with Audacity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="laptop_with_audacity"/>Laptop with Audacity</h2></div></div></div><p>Fix up a laptop with Audacity and a decent recording interface,
        plug into the sound console at the show, and you can edit and make CDs
        on the spot. Copy the raw tracks to a USB stick for performers who
        want to do their own editing. If the internal sound card in your
        laptop does not suit you, try a nice external USB recording interface
        like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#thinkpad_and_m-audio_mobilepre" title="Figure 4-3. ThinkPad and M-Audio MobilePre">Figure 4-3</a>,
        which shows a ThinkPad and M-Audio MobilePre USB all ready to go to
        the show.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another option is to use a higher-end PCMCIA sound card like the
        Digigram VXpocket v2. The Digigram costs about $500. It works on
        Linux, Windows, and Mac; provides two channels at full duplex; and
        supports S/PDIF and XLR connectors.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="thinkpad_and_m-audio_mobilepre"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e5808"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797511.png.jpg" alt="ThinkPad and M-Audio MobilePre"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-3. ThinkPad and M-Audio MobilePre</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Multitrack Recording of a Live Performance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="multitrack_recording_of_a_live_performan"/>Multitrack Recording of a Live Performance</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose you want more editing and mixing control, and you want
        to make a multichannel live recording. How do you do this? With the
        right knowledge and a big enough budget to support all the necessary
        equipment. Audacity records as many tracks at one time as your
        recording interface supports, starting with version 1.3.9. Older
        Audacity releases support a maximum of 16. (See <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Multitrack Recording">Chapter 9</a> to learn more about making good
        multitrack recordings with Audacity.)<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Don’t try this without really knowing what you are doing,
        because connecting things the wrong way will result in bad sound or
        even damaged equipment. If you do not have control of the PA system at
        the venue, then you will need the cooperation and help of the resident
        sound engineer. Here are four different ways to approach making live
        multitrack recordings.</p><p>One option is to supply your own microphones and mic every
        performer and instrument separately from the venue’s sound system.
        Although this means a lot of microphones and cables everywhere, this
        lets you use your own recording equipment independently of the main
        sound board.</p><p>A more common option is to use microphone and instrument cable
        splitters to make each mic and instrument cable do double duty. This
        is how many professionals record live concerts; they share mics that
        are run through splitters, and each team controls its own recording
        console. Sometimes these are tucked away backstage, and sometimes they
        have long cable runs running outside to mobile recording trucks. This
        setup has a lot of flexibility, and you can add your own mics as you
        see fit. For example, it seems to be a rule that no two people can
        agree on the correct way to mic drums, so they will set up their own
        drum mics.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You’ll need splitters, transformers, maybe some resistors and
        patch panels, and cables, and you’ll need to know how to connect
        everything. You’ll need to know the ins and outs of dealing with
        phantom power and who supplies it, connecting and disconnecting in the
        correct order, getting along with the other stage and sound crews, and
        lots more.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One more option is to connect directly to a mixing console that
        supports multichannel outputs. (A good word to know is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>busses</em></span>—the more busses a mixer has, the more
        flexible its signal routing options.) Then you don’t need redundant
        mics or splitters and long cable runs. Look for <span class="emphasis"><em>direct
        outs</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>aux sends</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>subgroup
        outs</em></span>. Some outputs send signals that are affected by the
        mixer controls, so they’ll have fades and special effects as applied
        by the console technician. If you want a straight unprocessed signal,
        that will depend on the features of the sound console and what the
        sound tech can let you use.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0022" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you are the sound engineer and get to use your own equipment,
        consider getting a multichannel digital mixer, like the PreSonus
        StudioLive 16-Channel FireWire Digital Mixer. Then you don’t need a
        separate ADC/DAC, and you don’t have to puzzle out how to make analog
        consoles designed for live shows also make good digital recordings.
        Sadly, the StudioLive is not supported on Linux, but it has excellent
        software bundles for Mac and Windows. This is a super nice, new
        generation mixer that is designed to support multichannel recording,
        both in the studio and in the performance hall. It costs about $2,000,
        plus you’ll also need an amplifier for powering live shows.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0024" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Be Nice to the Sound Crews"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="be_nice_to_the_sound_crews"/>Be Nice to the Sound Crews</h2></div></div></div><p>Be nice to the venue’s sound engineers and crew. They are
        skilled professionals who have to combine both science and artistry,
        and they will make or break your recordings. Don’t act like you know
        everything, because they won’t be fooled. In my experience, sound
        crews at live shows are nice people who share their expertise
        generously as long as you listen carefully, are helpful, and keep out
        of their way.</p></div></div></div>

      your analog-to-digital converter supports. Let’s say you have an analog
      mixer connected to a high-end sound card that supports up to 24/96

      float/48 for recording. It’s no good setting a higher sampling rate
      (upsampling) than your recording interface supports because there is no
      magic quality infusion. It wastes disk space and bogs down your CPU, and
      upsampling hurts audio quality. But there are benefits to recording at
      32-bit float even on 16-bit sound cards, which is explained in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a>. (See <a class="xref" href="ch01s13.html#solidus_44.1_comma_24_solidus_96_comma_3" title="16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit Float">16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit Float</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch01s13.html#solidus_44.1_comma_24_solidus_96_comma_3" title="16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit Float">16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit Float</a> to learn more

      digital output, then that will determine your maximum bit depth/sampling
      rate. For example, the Behringer Xenyx X2442USB 24-Channel Mixer is an
      analog mixer with a built-in ADC that delivers a 16/48 digital signal
      via USB. It plugs right into your computer, so you don’t need a sound
      card. So you could set Audacity to record at 32-bit float/48 for maximum
      quality. If 16/48 isn’t good enough, you could connect an outboard ADC
      that supports higher bit depths and sampling rates to the Xenyx’s RCA
      analog recording outputs.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="donat_switch_your_quality_settings_until"/><p class="title">Don’t Switch Your Quality Settings Until You’ve
        Finished!</p><p>It is best to stick with the same quality settings throughout
        recording and editing, until your final exports. Changing bit depths
        and resampling are not good for audio quality, so the fewer times a
        recording is resampled or exported to a lower bit depth, the better. I
        record and edit at 32-bit float/48 and then export to different
        quality levels as I need them, such as 24-bit WAV and FLAC for highest
        quality or the lower-quality Ogg Theora or MP3 formats. If you prefer
        recording and editing at lower quality levels, such as 16/44.1 (which
        is CD quality), the same principle applies: Use 16/44.1 from recording
        to final edit, and then if you want lower quality levels, select them
        as needed at export.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0036" class="indexterm"/></p><p>There isn’t much difference between a 44.1 kHz sampling rate and
        48 kHz. The sampling rate determines your frequency range, which is
        about half the sample rate. 44.1 kHz covers the range of human
        hearing. Sometimes I can hear a small difference in recordings made at
        48 kHz compared to 44.1 kHz recordings, but I have to be listening for
        it on a good sound system. There is a more noticeable difference
        between 16- and 24-bit recordings. Start with a high-quality
        recording, and then you can export to any number of lesser-quality
        formats as you want.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0037" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Setting Recording Volume Levels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="setting_recording_volume_levels"/>Setting Recording Volume Levels</h2></div></div></div><p>Set your recording levels before you start by clicking the

        digital recording has such a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is also
        called a <span class="emphasis"><em>low noise floor</em></span>, you can set a
        conservative peak level to allow for the unpredictability of a live
        performance. It’s not like recording on tape where we had to push
        recording levels as high as possible to keep noise levels at
        acceptable levels; you don’t want to go over zero in digital audio
        because that causes distortion. I aim for a peak level of -24 dB for

      all that goodness onto a CD?</p><p>If you used a digital recorder, you need to copy the files from
      the recorder into your Audacity computer. I prefer to use a separate
      storage card reader rather than connecting the recorder to the computer
      because it usually works better and faster, especially on non-Windows
      PCs. Any SD or Compact Flash card should be seen by your PC as a generic
      USB storage device, but manufacturers love to infest devices that use
      them with weird Windows-only file transfer managers. This does not make
      sense to me, since Windows has a perfectly good built-in USB storage
      device manager. Many of them also have a fondness for using USB 1.1, and
      not the full-speed 12Mbps but the agonizingly slow 1.5Mbps version,
      which is super fun when you fill a multigigabyte SD card.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0051" class="indexterm"/></p><p>However you do it, once your recording is transferred to your
      Audacity PC, open Audacity and use <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> to import your recording into Audacity.
      Then save this new Audacity project with <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project

        stereo recording.</p><p>This section is a short review of multichannel downmixing, so
        please visit <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Multitrack Recording">Chapter 9</a> to learn about
        multitrack recording and mixing in detail.</p><p>If you made a multitrack recording, which is three tracks or
        more, you have a lot more great editing options than with a
        two-channel stereo mix. One track per vocalist or instrument gives you
        ultimate control, and even if you had to settle for subgroups because
        of limitations of the mixer, this is still a feast of
        flexibility.</p><p>Starting in Audacity version 1.3.8, you can use the sleek new
        Mixer Board to adjust the pan and gain on each track by selecting
        <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Mixer Board</strong></span>. The playback in Audacity is
        exactly how your mix sounds, so you get an accurate preview of your
        mix.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0060" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Of course, you can still use the Pan and Gain controls on the
        Track panels of each track if you prefer.</p><p>Editing and fixing your tracks is the same whether you have a
        stereo mix or a multitrack recording, which we’ll cover in the
        following sections. There are some special hazards with multiple
        tracks. One is keeping them synchronized. Be careful with deletions
        and additions, because this changes the length of the tracks. Another
        is downmixing to two-channel stereo combines tracks so they get louder
        and might create clipping. Third is the Link Tracks button, which
        first appeared in Audacity 1.3.9. This keeps label tracks synchronized
        with the audio tracks. Having a label track at the top of your project
        is useful for making notes, and it does not link to the tracks below
        it. But a label track that lies underneath your audio tracks, which is
        where new label tracks always appear when you create new ones, creates
        a track group that includes all the audio tracks above it. Link Tracks
        is enabled by default, so if it gets in your way, just click the
        <span class="strong"><strong>Link Tracks</strong></span> button to turn it off.
        Newer Audacity versions display chain links that appear when you make
        any selection or Time Shift tracks to indicate that Link Tracks is
        active (<a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html#chain_links_appear_when_the_link_tracks" title="Figure 4-10. Chain links appear when the Link Tracks button is active.">Figure 4-10</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="chain_links_appear_when_the_link_tracks"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e6314"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797525.png.jpg" alt="Chain links appear when the Link Tracks button is active."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-10. Chain links appear when the Link Tracks button is
          active.</p></div><p>There are two ways to downmix. This first method is clicking
        <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Mix and Render</strong></span>, which creates a new stereo
        track in your Audacity project. You can then make further adjustments
        before export, such as creating labels, fixes, and other edits. It
        will sound just like the playback in Audacity sounds, so when it
        sounds right in Audacity, it’s ready to go. First set your left,
        right, and mono channel assignments in the Track menus. Left is
        channel 1, right is channel 2, and mono tracks are mixed down to
        both.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0063" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0066" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When you click <span class="strong"><strong>Tracks</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Mix and Render</strong></span>, your tracks are
        replaced with a new stereo track. If you would rather have Audacity
        create a new stereo track without replacing your original tracks, use
        the keyboard combination <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">shift</span>-M. I prefer the second method because I
        want to save my original tracks. Then I copy the new stereo track into
        a new project, finish editing, and then export.</p><p>Downmixing combines tracks, so they get louder. Make sure
        <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Clipping</strong></span> is activated so you can quickly find
        clipped passages. You might reduce the amplitude of all your tracks
        before downmixing with <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt;
        <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span> to -9 or -12 and then apply
        <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Normalize</strong></span> after downmixing to bring the
        volume back up where you want.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0068" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The second downmixing method opens a custom mixer, which is
        really a channel mapper, at export. Open <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Import/Export</strong></span>, and select “Use custom mix.”
        Then select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span>, and you’ll get a simple mixer (<a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html#downmixing_a_multichannel_recording_into" title="Figure 4-11. Downmixing a multichannel recording into two stereo tracks">Figure 4-11</a>) that allows you
        to control your channel mapping. This is how you control which tracks
        go to the right channel, left channel, or both. Channel 1 is always
        the left channel.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0069" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="downmixing_a_multichannel_recording_into"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e6423"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797527.png.jpg" alt="Downmixing a multichannel recording into two stereo tracks"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-11. Downmixing a multichannel recording into two stereo

        &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export Multiple</strong></span>, so if you
        want to divide your downmixed track into individual songs, you’ll have

        change the timing to CD frames, which is 75 frames per second (fps).
        This ensures that any cuts you make will start and end on a CD frame.
        Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and will
        possibly create clicking noises. <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html#setting_the_correct_frame_rate_for" title="Figure 4-12. Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio in the Selection toolbar">Figure 4-12</a> shows what this looks

        frames (75 fps). The former shows the time plus CD frames, and the
        latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To” box to ensure that
        stops and starts are always on the CD frame boundaries.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0072" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0073" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0074" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0075" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0076" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0077" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0078" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0079" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="setting_the_correct_frame_rate_for"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e6482"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797529.png.jpg" alt="Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio in the Selection toolbar"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-12. Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio in the Selection

        Remember that you have a lot of different views to choose from, such

        Selection</strong></span> is a great little time-saver that expands your
        selection to the width of the window. Remember also that Audacity has
        nearly unlimited undo, even past saves. You don’t lose your undo
        history until you close your project.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0080" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0081" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0082" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A good starting point is to trim away any excess. When you
        select unwanted segments for deletion, leave a little extra. You can
        always trim more, but it’s harder to put it back. The shaded area in

        of people speechifying and is not something I want to save, so it’s
        gone all in one swoop. There doesn’t appear to be anything at the
        beginning or in between the songs to trim right now, so I’ll leave
        those alone until later.</p><p>Another way to trim a lot of excess is to select what you want

        can apply repairs to just the one channel and rejoin the tracks. There

        clipped segments is better, but since you probably won’t have that
        opportunity with a live show, making them less noticeable is the next
        best thing. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span>
        button to see whether it sounds right, and if it doesn’t, change the

        not want to delete it because that shortens the track, which would be
        a problem on a multitrack project. If it is so long that silencing it
        would be too noticeable, try patching the annoying part with a clip
        from somewhere else. To do this, first delete the offending bit with
        <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Split Cut</strong></span>. This leaves a gap in place of the
        deleted portion. Then carefully paste into the gap a segment of the
        same length copied from another part of the track, or even from a
        different track; you can use anything as long as it sounds all right.
        This can be finicky work, so remember to zoom in so you can see what
        you’re doing. The Envelope tool is good for smoothing transitions with
        careful fades, or try the Draw tool to apply some careful

        a few tries to get it right because noise removal is always a
        compromise with its side effects—removing noise also affects the
        sounds you want to keep. If the sounds that you want to keep have
        similar volume and frequencies as the noise, you might not get very
        good results. Noise removal works best when the noise is distinctly

        to the left is more aggressive, and moving it to the right makes
        gentler changes. A larger value for Frequency smoothing means it
        changes a wider range of frequencies. Remember: Attack refers to how
        hard a note is hit, and decay is how long it takes to fade away.

        audio editing. For example, in podcasts that have more than one person
        talking, it’s a kindness to your listeners to make sure that the
        volume levels of the various people speaking are all the same.
        Compression is also used to change the character of sounds. For
        example, drums are mostly rapid peak sounds, so a bit of compression
        is used to give them a fuller, richer sound. Compression can make a
        vocalist or instrument “pop” out of the mix and make it sound more
        vivid. Compression can also help level out an erratic performer, such
        as a singer with bad mic technique or an instrumentalist who doesn’t
        have good volume control but is loud and soft at the wrong
        times.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0104" class="indexterm"/></p><p>What you can accomplish with compression will be limited by your
        recordings. If you have multitrack recordings with every performer and
        instrument on their own tracks, or usefully subgrouped, then you have
        all kinds of editing flexibility. If your recording is two-track
        stereo, then you can’t edit very surgically, but you can apply
        compression to the whole recording to make it sound better in noisy
        environments, such as vehicles and workplaces. Controlling it yourself
        means you can measure out just the right amount.</p><p>There are several places in the audio chain where compression
        can be applied. Was a compressor used during recording? If it was, be
        careful about applying any more because that can make your track sound
        fake or weird.</p><p>I’m conservative when it comes to using compression. If
        something needs to be louder or quieter, I prefer to adjust it with
        the Envelope tool or Amplify effect. In the olden days of tape,
        compression techniques like Dolby noise reduction were used to
        minimize tape hiss. Music was compressed in the recording and then
        expanded on playback to lower the noise floor. Digital audio has such
        a high signal-to-noise ratio, this isn’t necessary.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0105" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0106" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0107" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0108" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0109" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0110" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0111" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0112" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Now let’s learn how to use Audacity’s Compressor effect (<a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html#audacityas_compressor_effect_for_applyin" title="Figure 4-15. Audacity’s Compressor effect for applying dynamic range compression">Figure 4-15</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0113" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0114" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="audacityas_compressor_effect_for_applyin"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e6815"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797535.png.jpg" alt="Audacity’s Compressor effect for applying dynamic range compression"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-15. Audacity’s Compressor effect for applying dynamic range
          compression</p></div><p>Select what you want to apply compression to, part of a track or
        a whole track, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Compressor</strong></span> to open the Compressor effect. You
        can make the Compressor window larger and expand the decibel scales by
        dragging the corners.</p><p>The Threshold setting determines the starting point, in
        decibels, where the gain of the audio signal is reduced. A threshold
        of -60 dB means everything with an amplitude of -60 dB and above will
        have reduced gain, which in most cases is too much, since that will be
        everything. A threshold of -10 dB means the loudest 10 dB of your
        track will have its gain reduced.</p><p>The Noise Floor setting prevents background noise from being
        amplified during pauses by keeping the gain constant until the signal
        comes back up to the Threshold level; it does not allow the gain to
        increase in quiet passages that are below the Noise Floor decibel
        setting. If there are no quiet pauses in your audio, then this setting
        won’t help much, and you should move the slider all the way to the
        left, -80 dB, to make it have no effect.</p><p>The Ratio setting controls how much compression, or reduction in
        gain, will be applied to sounds that are higher than your Threshold
        setting. A higher ratio, such as 4:1, means more compression. An input
        signal of 4 dB higher than your threshold will be reduced to 1 dB
        higher than the threshold, so it applies a 3 dB reduction. Try gentler
        ratios first, starting at 2:1, and then listen to the preview. If it’s
        not enough, try a higher ratio. Audacity’s compressor has a maximum
        ratio of 10:1, which is a lot. Other compressors go as high as
        60:1.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0115" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0116" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0117" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Attack Time determines how quickly compression is applied, and
        Decay Time determines how long it takes to phase out the compression.
        A too-short Attack Time might result in some audible distortion, and a
        too-long Decay Time might miss some short peaks. The Preview button
        helps you try different settings quickly.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0118" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0119" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Compression makes your audio quieter, so you may need to amplify
        or normalize it after applying compression. The Compressor effect has
        a “Make-up gain for 0 dB after compressing” checkbox, which is another
        way of saying apply normalization to 0 dB. I don’t use it because I
        prefer to control normalization separately, and I don’t always
        normalize to 0 dB, but it’s there if you want to save a step.</p><p>There is also a “Compress based on Peaks” checkbox. When this
        box is unchecked, which is the default, the compressor reduces the
        gain on sounds above the Threshold level using RMS values. “Compress
        based on Peaks” raises the gain on quieter sounds that are above the
        Threshold level.</p><p>Be careful with compression because it is easy to overdo it. In
        much of modern popular music, there is virtually no dynamic range;
        it’s all rammed into the same narrow 5 dB or even smaller range with
        no quiet passages, no contrast, and just one big shouting blob all
        boosted to the maximum, sometimes even into distortion. Any emotional
        impact and artistry are destroyed. You’re trying to make it more
        comfortable for different listening environments or improve how a
        vocalist or instrument sound, not kill the recording entirely.</p><p>Visit <a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html" title="Compress Dynamic Range">Compress Dynamic Range</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch12s09.html" title="Change Speed">Change Speed</a> to learn more about dynamic range

        project and have already done all of your other cleanups and fixes. A
        single stereo track in an Audacity project can contain a number of
        songs, but to Audacity it’s all one long, unbroken track; it doesn’t
        know where the song breaks are, so you have to make them yourself.
        There are two different approaches you can take. One is the usual
        collection of separate songs with a few seconds of silence dividing
        them. Another is marking the song breaks so you can skip around, but
        with no breaks between them, like a live concert album.</p><p>Whichever you prefer, just do as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html#creating_song_titles_and_breaking_up_a_l" title="Figure 4-16. Creating song titles and breaking up a long track into individual songs with a label track">Figure 4-16</a>: Figure out

      filenames, which is a nice time-saver. Most CD-writing programs create a
      default two-second gap between songs, so watch out for this. You can
      make a live album that sounds like one long, unbroken track by
      eliminating these gaps and still have individual song tracks so you can
      skip around.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0154" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0155" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0156" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0157" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0158" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0159" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0160" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0161" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0162" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0163" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0164" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0165" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0166" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Labeling Your CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="labeling_your_cd"/>Labeling Your CD</h2></div></div></div><p>Don’t use sticky paper labels on your CDs, because these degrade
        the disc over time. There are better ways to create nice-looking
        labels. You can get special CD blanks that are made to be printed on
        by inkjet printers that support printing on CDs. These are different
        from ordinary printers by having a special tray to hold the
        disc.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0167" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another type of printable CD requires a special thermal printer.
        These are not expensive, usually around $100.</p><p>A third type is the <span class="emphasis"><em>LightScribe</em></span> CD, which
        requires a special CD writer and CD blanks. These cost about the same
        as ordinary CD/DVD writers, around $50.</p><p>There are many software programs for designing your CD labels
        and making them look nice and professional.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mass CD Duplication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="mass_cd_duplication"/>Mass CD Duplication</h2></div></div></div><p>You might want to make CDs to distribute, and you can do this
        without spending huge amounts of money. There are many laser CD
        duplicators that are like your computer’s CD burner, only faster and
        with multiple trays. These range from about $400 for simple
        duplicators with manual feeds to several thousand dollars for
        automatic feeds and local data storage.</p><p>There are also commercial duplication services with varying
        levels of service, such as cover art and design. These can be
        cost-effective and save you time and hassle. The best CDs are pressed
        rather than burned. A duplication service that uses a press rather
        than a laser duplicator costs more and usually requires larger runs.
        But your discs will last longer.</p><p>“Do I need to buy a special audio CD?” is a common question. No,
        you do not. All CDs are exactly the same type, but it is worth
        sticking with good brands like Taiyo Yuden (my favorite). Verbatim,
        Ridata, and MAM-A are also reliable brands. Always get CD-R; don’t
        bother with CD-RW except for experimentation.
