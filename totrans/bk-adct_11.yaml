    what the various settings mean, is often a bit of a challenge. There is some information
    on the Audacity wiki, and the home sites of the various plug-in projects have
    documentation of varying degrees of helpfulness. It’s easy enough to try them
    and hear for yourself what they do. In this chapter, we’ll cover a batch of commonly
    used plug-ins in detail and define some terminology. A brief audio glossary at

    value is backward, and a positive value is forward. This is called *linear phase*
    because all frequencies are affected equally. Sometimes we don’t notice a linear
    phase shift because there is nothing to compare it to. An example of this is playing
    a CD—the music is delayed a little bit by passing through the digital-to-audio
    converter, but we don’t care because we don’t notice it. On the other hand, this
    is a real problem for overdubbing because new tracks will be out of sync with
    old tracks, so we have to compensate for it. (See [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Multitrack

    That’s right, just like a circle. The degree of phase shift is most easily explained
    by looking at [Figure 11-29](ch11s03.html#phase_shift_is_measured_in_degrees_of_a
    "Figure 11-29. Phase shift is measured in degrees of a circle."). A sine wave
    alternates smoothly between positive and negative voltage; positive voltage is
    above the center line, and negative voltage is below. Where the waveform crosses
    the center line is the *zero crossing point*, because that is the point of zero
    voltage. The starting point of the sine wave is zero rising to positive; 180 degrees
    is at zero crossing into negative. When it gets back to zero from negative, that
    is a full 360 degrees.

    a simple echo to weird space alien noises.'

    that is the *fundamental frequency*. This note may also be accompanied by harmonics,
    which are other notes that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
    So, a fundamental frequency of 100Hz can have harmonics of 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400
    Hz, and so on. These are numbered in order: fundamental frequency, 2, 3, 4, and

    reverb is applied to recordings to enliven them and make them sound more realistic.
    It is used in live shows to create a bigger, more spacious sound. You can’t control
