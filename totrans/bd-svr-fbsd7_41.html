<p class="docText1"><a name="OpenSSH is" class="calibre8" id="OpenSSH is"/>OpenSSH is a set of open source utilities that implement the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. <span class="docEmphasis1">SSH</span><a name="secure version" class="calibre8" id="secure version"/> is a secure version of telnet; it's a protocol used to access the console or command line of remote systems. SSH provides administrators and users with access to a remote system as if they were physically at the console.<a name="IDX-CHP-17-0257" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0257"/><a name="IDX-CHP-17-0258" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0258"/><a name="IDX-CHP-17-0259" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0259"/><a name="IDX-CHP-17-0260" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0260"/><a name="IDX-CHP-17-0261" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0261"/><a name="IDX-CHP-17-0262" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0262"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="eavesdropping on" class="calibre8" id="eavesdropping on"/>SSH uses encryption to prevent eavesdropping on connections made between a client and server. The telnet protocol lacks encryption; this gives eavesdroppers the ability to capture usernames and passwords with a packet sniffer. (A <span class="docEmphasis1">packet sniffer</span><a name="program designed" class="calibre8" id="program designed"/> is a program designed to monitor and capture network traffic.)</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="overwhelming " class="calibre8" id="overwhelming "/>OpenSSH commands an overwhelming 87 percent of the SSH market, according to a survey conducted in November 2005.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="calibre2" href="#CHP-17-1">[]</a></sup><a name="Linux and" class="calibre8" id="Linux and"/> It is included in virtually every distribution of Linux and BSD, as well as Apple's Mac OS X.</p><blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre37"><a name="CHP-17-1" class="calibre8" id="CHP-17-1">[]</a></sup> OpenBSD, "SSH Usage Profiling," <a class="calibre2" target="_blank" href="http://www.openssh.com/usage/index.html">http://www.openssh.com/usage/index.html</a>.<a name="IDX-CHP-17-0263" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0263"/></p></blockquote>
<p class="docText1"><a name="by Tatu" class="calibre8" id="by Tatu"/>The SSH protocol was first developed in 1995 by Tatu Ylönen, a researcher from Helsinki University of Technology. Ylönen founded SSH Communications Security in late 1995 to develop and market SSH. His company currently markets the SSH Tectia Server/Client.<a name="IDX-CHP-17-0264" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-17-0264"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="of the" class="calibre8" id="of the"/>OpenSSH was originally conceived by the OpenBSD team as part of the OpenBSD 2.6 release in December 1999. The team used code from Tatu Ylönen's SSH project, which was originally open source. Bugs were fixed and features were added to the OpenSSH release. Soon after the release of OpenSSH, its developers decided to split into two teams. One group concentrated on the development of OpenSSH for OpenBSD while the other group developed a portable version of OpenSSH for use on other platforms. The portable edition has the letter <span class="docEmphasis1">P</span><a name="is still" class="calibre8" id="is still"/> appended to the version to signify this. OpenSSH is still developed by the OpenBSD team and is led by its founder, Theo de Raadt.</p>
