- en: OpenSSL is an open source toolkit and cryptographic library that implements
    the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. OpenSSL
    is an independent project managed by various volunteers from around the world.
    In short, OpenSSL provides cryptography tools for securing network connections.

    Protocol secured with encryption). An HTTPS handshake consists of the following

    public key, domain name, and issuing certificate authority.

    key.

    information securely, assuming the issuing certificate authority is trusted by
    the client.

- en: OpenSSL provides the tools needed to create certificate signing requests, private
    server keys, and self-signed certificates. When coupled with a recognized certificate
    authority, trusted server certificates can be produced for use with TCP protocols
    like HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, and so on.

- en: OpenSSL is based on the SSLeay library originally developed by Eric A. Young
    and Tim J. Hudson. SSLeay was an open source implementation of Netscape's Secure
    Socket Layer protocol, which was used in the Netscape Secure Server and Navigator
    browser in the mid-1990s.
