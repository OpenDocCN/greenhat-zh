    is a computer expert. Hacking is an attitude of exploration. However, real hackers
    can often use their computer skills and knowledge to take advantage of other people.
    When hackers want to use their computer skills to steal from other people, they
    usually engage in some form of identity theft. When hackers want to use their
    computer skills to bombard people with advertisements for legitimate (and not-so-legitimate)
    products, they use spam.

    and more convenient. In simple terms, identity theft involves masquerading as
    someone else so they get stuck paying your bills. This can be as easy as a waiter
    copying down your credit card number when you pay your dinner bill and then using
    it to order expensive merchandise by mail or over the Internet.

    valuable. Identity thieves look for documents with personal information printed
    on them, such as unopened credit card offers that already have a name and address
    on them. The identity thief can then fill out the application and have a credit
    card sent to you. Next, unless you have a locking mailbox, he watches your mail
    until the new card arrives. At this point, the identity thief can start racking
    up charges on a credit card that you don't even know exists (but that has your
    name printed on it, as will the bills that start pouring in a month later). Military
    bases are popular places for identity thieves to work because these locations
    often give them access to mail for a large number of people, which they can then
    intercept even without being a postal employee.

    either by sending you email or calling you on the phone and pretending to be a
    legitimate company. To reach as many potential victims as possible, identity thieves
    may send a bogus email to thousands of people at once (a more malicious form of
    spam) and wait for a certain percentage of the recipients to fall for the scam
    and enter their personal information on their website.

    to provide their name, address, and phone number in the process. Since people
    aren't giving away anything that can't be found in a telephone book, they often
    see nothing wrong with doing this. What they don't realize is that they've made
    the identity thief's job a lot easier. He can use this information to find that
    person's Social Security and credit card numbers later.

    never respond to unsolicited phone calls or emails.

    can control the infected or zombie computers with a program, called a bot, which
    may be stored on an IRC chat room. The hacker then rents out his network of infected
    computers to spammers, who send their spam to the controlling bot, which in turn
    distributes it through the zombie network. This has several advantages over other
    spamming methods for the unscrupulous bulk emailer.

    zombie computer, or through each infected computer's ISP's mail server, tracing
    the spam to its source leads to an innocent person, not to the spammer himself.
    Second, by sending spam through a network controlled by a bot, known as a botnet,
    the spammer isn't directly violating his ISP's ban on bulk mailing. Third, and
    most importantly, many spam filters work by blocking messages from known bulk
    email accounts. When the spam comes from computers connected through different
    ISPs such as Earthlink, spam can often circumvent any filters people have installed.
    (If a filter detects massive amounts of email coming from a single ISP, the spam
    filter will block it. But if the email is coming from multiple ISPs, the filter
    often wrongly assumes the email is valid.)

    the Internet with spam. Now if anyone traces the spam back to its source, they'll

    "Figure 18-5. You can configure a Bayesian filter to "learn" how to recognize

    a digital signature of the customer's domain name, using strong encryption so
    no one could alter or forge it. One of the first implementations of this idea
    has come from Yahoo! ([http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys](http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys))
    and its open-source program DomainKeys, which verifies the domain of email senders.
    If someone tries to forge an email address, DomainKeys will automatically flag
    the message as spam.

    to whom you send email and from whom you receive it. The idea is that you're more
    likely to want email from people you've contacted before, and that email from
    unknown addresses is more likely to be spam. To grab a copy of SNARF, visit Microsoft

    In their simplest usage, web bugs help advertisers determine how many people have
    visited a particular website and viewed a particular web page. On a more insidious
    level, web bugs can be used with browser cookies to track which websites a particular
    person visits and tailor advertisements specific to that individual's interests.

    code (where a web bug can hide). The reason is simple. As soon as you view spam
    (such as in the Preview pane of an email program like Thunderbird or Outlook Express),
    your computer retrieves the text and graphic images defined by that HTML code.
    As soon as your computer requests the web bug, the web bug's server can identify
    not only your IP address and operating system, but also when you viewed the spam.
    This information can be particularly important because it tells the spammer that
    someone actually viewed the spam so the email address is valid (and can be sold
    to other spammers too).

    opened the "spam" or not.

    web bug test message from the [nthelp.com](http://nthelp.com) site as spam, it
    will let the test message's web bug slip through, which also means that any spam
    that can slip past Thunderbird's spam filters will also be able to verify your
    email address, too. (In my limited testing with different email programs, both

    cleaning*, *pool chemistry*, and *pool safety*. Of course, this could clutter
    up the appearance of your web page and ruin its readability. Instead, the keywords
    are hidden using tiny fonts in text that appears as the same color as the page
    background. In this way, the text isn't visible to ordinary users, but search
    engines still find multiple instances of the embedded keywords and will rank the
    website higher than a competitor's website with the same keywords mentioned only
    three or four times.

    and store program setting information in a special system database known as the
    Windows registry. A well-behaved program runs only when the user loads it and
    stops when the user exits the program. To remove a well-behaved program, a user
    needs only to run the uninstall program that deletes the program folder and also
    deletes the information stored in the Windows registry.

    and folders in multiple places on your hard disk to make itself nearly impossible
    to find and remove. Some may also hide a dropper program, a tiny program meant
    to slip past a computer's defenses and hide on the hard disk. The moment the dropper
    program detects that you've removed the spyware program, it accesses the Internet
    again and puts all the spyware right back on your computer.

    modified version of Ubuntu Linux running the Firefox browser. By using Firefox
    within Ubuntu Linux (within the VMWare Player), you effectively isolate any Internet
    dangers that could infect your computer and the Windows operating system on it.

    a handful of anti-spyware programs, but it won't get by all of them. For that

    that there are plenty of free anti-spyware programs to choose from, such as Spybot
    ([www.safer-networking.org](http://www.safer-networking.org)), Ad-Aware ([www.lavasoftusa.com](http://www.lavasoftusa.com)),
    Bazooka ([www.kephyr.com](http://www.kephyr.com)), SpywareBlaster ([www.javacoolsoftware.com](http://www.javacoolsoftware.com)),
    or Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware ([www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com)).

    programs won't find it, not because of technical reasons, but because of business
    reasons, and you'll be the one left to suffer.
