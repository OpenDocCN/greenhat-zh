Let me repeat that: Wireless networks are not secure. They are safe enough for many users most of the time, but it's just not possible to make a network that uses radio to exchange data absolutely private.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1204"/></p><p>Wireless networks are a trade-off between security and convenience. The obvious benefits of a wireless network connection—fast and easy access to the network from a portable computer or an isolated location—come at a cost. For most users, the convenience of wireless operation outweighs the potential security threats. But just as you lock the doors of your car when you park it on the street, you should take similar steps to protect your network and your data.</p><p>The simple truth is that a wireless network uses radio signals with a well-defined set of characteristics, so somebody who wants to dedicate enough time and effort to monitoring those signals can probably find a way to intercept and read the data contained in them. If you send confidential information through a wireless link, an eavesdropper can copy it. Credit card numbers, account passwords, and other personal information are all vulnerable.</p><p>An entire catalog of tools for cracking <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1205"/>Wi-Fi <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1206"/>encryption methods is easy to find on the Internet. 3G broadband and WiMAX networks might be more secure than Wi-Fi ones (primarily because capturing data from them is more difficult), and WPA encryption is better than WEP encryption, but no wireless security is perfect. Encryption and other security methods can make data a little more difficult to steal, but they don't provide complete protection against a really dedicated snoop. As any policeman will tell you, locks are great for keeping out honest people, but serious thieves know how to get past them.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-22"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Wireless network encryption (such as WPA or WEP) takes place at the data layer of the OSI model (discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKING">Chapter 1</a>).

"<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1208"/>Drive-by logins" to unprotected private networks are possible in many urban and suburban business districts and in a surprising number of residential neighborhoods. When Wi-Fi was still a new technology, the <span class="emphasis"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></span> reported that a network security expert with a directional antenna mounted on the roof of a van in downtown San Francisco could log in to an average of half a dozen wireless networks <span class="emphasis"><em>per block</em></span>. That number would be much greater today. A year later, a group of Microsoft employees who ran an "unofficial" test found more than 200 <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1209"/>unprotected access points in a suburban neighborhood outside Seattle. Today, most people have gotten the message about using encryption on their home and office networks, but too many of them are still using the older WEP encryption system rather than the much more secure WPA method. The technical support people at one major telephone company, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1210"/>Qwest, were still advising their DSL customers to use WEP encryption as late as mid-2007.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1211"/></p><p>If you're located in a city center or a suburb, you can probably see this for yourself. When you use your Wi-Fi control program to scan the networks in your neighborhood, you will probably see a list of nearby networks in addition to your own access point. The control program will also tell you what kind of encryption (if any) each network is using. In the example shown in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#four_of_the_networks_in_this_neighborhoo" title="Figure 12-1. Four of the networks in this neighborhood require an encryption key before they will connect.">Figure 12-1</a>, one network (RedGoldandGreen) is wide open, and four others are encrypted; two of the encrypted networks use WPA, and the two that are listed as "security-enabled" without an encryption type use WEP.</p><p>Do the math: your access point has a range of 150 feet or more in all directions, so the signal probably extends beyond your own property lines (or the walls of your apartment or office). A network device in the building next door or across the street can probably detect your network. And so can a laptop or PDA inside a car parked on the street. If you don't take some precautions to prevent it, the operator of that device can log in to your LAN, steal files from your servers, and tie up your Internet connection with streaming videos or multiplayer games.</p><div class="figure"><a id="four_of_the_networks_in_this_neighborhoo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e12791"/><img alt="Four of the networks in this neighborhood require an encryption key before they will connect." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254511.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 12-1. Four of the networks in this neighborhood require an encryption key before they will connect.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>It's important to understand that we're talking about two different kinds of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1212"/>security threats to a wireless network. The first is the danger of an outsider connecting to your network without your knowledge or permission; the second is the possibility that a dedicated eavesdropper can steal or modify data as you send and receive it. Each represents a different potential problem, and each requires a different approach to prevention and protection. While it's certainly true that none of the encryption tools currently available can provide complete protection, they can make life more difficult for most casual intruders. And as long as they're out there, you might as well use them.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1213"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1214"/></p><p>An unsecured wireless network presents many opportunities to an attacker. Not only are the network crackers able to monitor any data that moves through the network, but they might also be able to modify it. If, for example, there is a vulnerability in your web browser, an attacker can replace images as you view them with an image that exploits that vulnerability and installs a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1215"/>trojan on your computer, allowing the attacker to steal data stored on the computer that <span class="emphasis"><em>you never sent over the wireless network</em></span>. This type of attack might be relatively rare (casual snoopers are unlikely to take the time on the chance you have something interesting), but it still presents a serious risk. Also, many popular websites encrypt the login page with SSL encryption via HTTPS, but they don't encrypt subsequent pages to reduce the drain on processing power—your password might be secure, but any email you read via the webmail interface might not be, and attackers might be able to steal the cookie (a unique piece of data included with web information) that identifies your login and access your mailbox directly.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="protecting_your_network_and_your_data"/>Protecting Your Network and Your Data</h1></div></div></div><p>As the operator of a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1216"/>Wi-Fi network, what can you do to discourage intruders? There are a few techniques that can make things difficult for them. First, you can accept the fact that wireless networks are not completely secure and use the built-in network <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1217"/>security features to slow down would-be intruders; second, you can supplement your wireless router's built-in tools with a hardware or software firewall (or both) to isolate the wireless network; and third, you can deploy additional encryption such as a VPN to secure traffic to the network.</p><p>The security features of the early Wi-Fi protocols (WEP encryption) were not adequate to protect data. The WEP protocol was flawed in several ways. The basic encryption method (the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1218"/>RC4 algorithm) was known to have weaknesses in certain applications, it required all users to know the key, and provided no secure mechanisms for distributing new keys. Most of these shortcomings were acknowledged and dismissed as being outside the scope of the goal of providing the same protection that a user on a standard wired network would receive, but, in fact, the result was that wireless equivalent privacy was little better than no protection at all. Recent attacks (such as those performed by the aircrack-ptw tool) have further undermined WEP because they've often been able to disclose an encryption key in a matter of minutes by analyzing a limited amount of traffic. With these developments, WEP should be treated more as a "do not disturb" sign than as a real means of protection.</p><p>The WPA and WPA2 standards attempt to fix the shortcomings of WEP, but they only work when all of the users of a network have modern cards and drivers. Most, if not all, cards made in the last few years will support WPA or WPA2.</p><p>For most of us, the more serious danger is not that people will eavesdrop on our messages, but that they will create their own connection to our network and either read files stored on computers on the LAN or steal the broadband connection to the Internet without our knowledge. However, business networks must take extra precautions to protect their (and their customers') data. Several high-profile compromises of customer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1219"/>credit card data in major retail chains have been traced to inadequate network protection.</p><p>It's essential to maintain control of your network. Here are some specific steps to take:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use your access point's default <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1220"/>SSID. Those defaults are well known to network crackers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change the SSID to something that doesn't identify your business or your location. If an intruder detects something called BigCorpNet and they look around to see BigCorp headquarters across the street, they'll home right in on that network. Same thing for a home network; don't use your family name or the street address or anything else that makes it easy to figure out where the signal is coming <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1221"/>from.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use an SSID that makes your network sound like it contains some kind of fascinating content—use a boring name like, oh, <span class="emphasis"><em>network5</em></span>, or even a string of gibberish, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>W24rnQ</em></span>. If a would-be cracker sees a list of nearby networks, yours should look like it's the least interesting of the lot.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change your access point's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1222"/>IP address <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1223"/>and password. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1224"/>factory default <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1225"/>passwords <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1226"/>for most access point configuration tools are easy to find (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1227"/>and they're often the same from one manufacturer to another—hint: don't use <span class="emphasis"><em>admin</em></span>), so they're not even good enough to keep out your own users, let alone unknown intruders who want to use your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1228"/>network for their own benefit. If an outsider gets into the access point's software, they could lock you out of your own network by <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1229"/>changing the password and the encryption key.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If possible, place your indoor access point in the middle of the building rather than close to a window. This will reduce the distance that your network signals will extend beyond your own walls.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use WPA encryption rather than WEP. WPA encryption is a lot more difficult to break, especially if you use a complex encryption key.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change your encryption keys often. It takes time to sniff encryption keys out of a data stream; every time the keys change, the miscreants trying to steal your data are forced to start again from scratch. Once or twice every month is not too often to change keys in a home network. An office LAN should change keys at least once a week.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't store your encryption keys in plaintext on the network where they are used. This seems obvious, but in a widespread network, it might be tempting to distribute them on a private web page or in a text file. Don't do it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don't use email to distribute encryption keys. Even if you're not sending emails in plaintext, an intruder who has stolen account names and passwords will receive the messages with your new codes before your legitimate users get them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add another layer of encryption, such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1230"/>Kerberos, on top of the encryption built into the wireless network.

Access control restricts network connections to network clients with specified MAC addresses. The access point will refuse to associate with any adapter whose address is not on the list. This might not be practical if you want to allow visitors to use your network, but it's a useful tool in a home or small business network where you know all of your potential users. MAC address <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1232"/>filtering will not prevent a determined attacker from copying the address of an authenticated user, but it could provide an additional layer of protection.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test your network's security by trying to find and use your network from outside your own building. Take a laptop computer running a sniffer program, such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1233"/>NetStumbler or your network adapter's control program, and start walking away from the building. If you can detect your network from a block away, so can an intruder.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Turn on the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1234"/>security features, but treat the network as if it was wide open to public access.

It can be done, even if you're using encryption. You have to assume that any data transmitted through a wireless network is not secure. A determined eavesdropper with the right equipment and software can copy your data packets as they move through the air. It's possible, but it's not likely unless you are a target of government surveillance or industrial espionage.</p><p>The only way to be absolutely sure that nobody is monitoring your wireless network is to stop using it. But it's even easier to monitor the cordless phone in your kitchen. In general, you can assume that a connection through a public network is no more or less secure than a link to your own network. If somebody is serious about stealing your network packets, they will probably find a way to do it.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm12_d1e13067"/></p></div></div></div>

In a network with just one access point, the name is the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1240"/>basic service set ID (BSSID). When the network has more than one access point, the name becomes the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1241"/>extended service set ID (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1242"/>ESSID), but your computer's control program displays both types in the same list. The generic designation for all network names is the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1243"/>SSID, which is the term you will see most often in wireless access point and client configuration utility programs.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1244"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1245"/></p><p>When you configure the access points for a network, you must specify the SSID for that network. Every access point and network client in a network must use the same SSID.</p><p>When a network client detects two or more access points with the same SSID, it assumes that they are all part of the same network (even if the access points are operating on different radio channels), and it associates with the access point that provides the strongest or cleanest signal. If that signal deteriorates due to interference or fading, the client will try to shift to another access point on what it thinks is the same network. This transfer is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>hand off</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1246"/></p><p>If two different networks with overlapping signals have the same name, a client will assume that they're both parts of a single network, and it might try to perform a hand off from one network to the other. From the user's point of view, this misdirected hand off will look as if the network has completely dropped its connection. Therefore, every wireless network that could possibly overlap with another network must have a unique SSID.</p><p>The exceptions to the unique SSID rule are public and community networks that only provide access to the Internet but not to other computers or other devices on a LAN. Those networks often have a common SSID, so subscribers can detect and connect to them from more than one location. In other words, if you have an Internet access account at your local coffee shop, you might find and use exactly the same SSID when you visit another shop owned by the same company.</p><p>A network's SSID provides a very limited form of access control because it's necessary to specify the SSID when you set up a wireless connection. The SSID option in an access point is always a text field that will accept any name you care to assign, but many network configuration programs (including the wireless network tools in Windows XP and those supplied with several major brands of network adapters) automatically detect and display the SSIDs of every active network within their signal range.</p><p>It's not always necessary to know the SSID of a network before you try to connect; the configuration utility (or a network monitor or sniffer program like NetStumbler) will show you the names of every nearby network in a list or a menu (the exceptions are networks in which the Broadcast SSID feature has been turned <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1247"/>off).

A sniffer program (such as NetStumbler) can still detect it and display the SSID, and every time a user connects to the network, the network adapter sends the SSID in a packet that can easily be sniffed.

As the name suggests, the original intent of the wired equivalent privacy (WEP) protocol was to provide a level of security on wireless networks that was comparable to that of a wired network. That was the goal, but a network that depends on WEP encryption is almost as vulnerable to intrusion as a network with no protection at all. It will keep out the casual snoops (and your freeloading neighbors, if they're not particularly adept at cracking encryption), but it's not particularly effective against a dedicated intruder. The more recent WPA encryption is <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> the better choice.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1258"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1259"/></p><p>WEP encryption is intended to serve three functions: it prevents unauthorized access to the network, it performs an integrity check on each packet, and it protects the data from eavesdroppers. WEP uses a secret encryption key to encode data packets before a network client or an access point transmits them, and it uses the same key to decode the packets after they have been received. The original standard used <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1260"/>shared authentication, in which the access point sends a challenge packet that a client must encrypt with the proper WEP key and send back. However, this technique opens a significant vulnerability by allowing a snooper to watch both parts of the exchange and figure out the key. The "open" authentication method, which should be used by any network using WEP (not that any network should use it), simply discards packets that cannot be decrypted by the network's WEP key.</p><p>Therefore, the WEP settings must be exactly the same on every access point and client adapter in the network. This sounds simple enough, but it gets confusing because manufacturers use different methods to identify the size and format of a WEP key. The functions don't change from one brand to another, but identical settings don't always have identical descriptions.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="how_many_bits_in_your_encryption_key"/>How Many Bits in Your Encryption Key?</h3></div></div></div><p>A WEP key can have either 64 bits or 128 bits. Although 128-bit keys are more difficult to crack (but they are still pretty insecure), they also increase the amount of time needed to transmit each packet. However, confusion arises because a 40-bit WEP key is the same as a 64-bit WEP key, and a 104-bit key is the same as a 128-bit key. The standard 64-bit WEP key is a string that includes an internally generated 24-bit initialization vector and a 40-bit secret key assigned by the network manager. Some manufacturers' specifications and configuration programs call this <span class="emphasis"><em>64-bit encryption</em></span>, but others describe it as <span class="emphasis"><em>40-bit encryption</em></span>. Either way, the encryption scheme is the same, so an adapter that uses 40-bit encryption is fully compatible with an access point or another adapter that uses 64-bit encryption.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1261"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1262"/></p><p>Many network adapters and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1263"/>access points also include a <span class="emphasis"><em>strong encryption</em></span> option that uses a 128-bit key.

The protocol's problems are a result of misunderstanding of some cryptographic primitives and therefore combining them in insecure ways."</p><p>Researchers at <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1290"/>Rice University and AT&amp;T <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1291"/>Labs published a description of their attack against WEP encrypted networks (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.securitytechnet.com/resource/hot-topic/wlan/wep_attack.pdf">http://www.securitytechnet.com/resource/hot-topic/wlan/wep_attack.pdf</a>) that led them to a similar opinion: "802.11 WEP is totally insecure." They were able to order and receive the necessary hardware, set up a network for testing, design their attack tool, and successfully capture a 128-bit WEP key in less than a week.</p><p>Both the Berkeley and the AT&amp;T Labs reports are written by and for technical experts who have a background in cryptography. Their conclusions are clear, but their methods assume that an intruder has some serious technical knowledge. However, it doesn't take a network expert to crack WEP <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1292"/>encryption; <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1293"/>tools for less sophisticated code breakers are also easy to find. Both <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1294"/>AirSnort (from the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1295"/>Shmoo Group, <a class="ulink" href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com">http://airsnort.shmoo.com</a>) and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1296"/>WEPCrack (<a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wepcrack">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wepcrack</a>) are Linux programs that monitor wireless network <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1297"/>signals and exploit the weaknesses in the WEP algorithm to extract the encryption key. There are dozens of others. Just a few minutes with Google or any other Internet search tool is all it takes to find WEP cracking tools and detailed instructions for using them.</p><p>Recently announced attacks against WEP, implemented in tools such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1298"/>aircrack-ptw, can break WEP keys in a matter of minutes using a very limited amount of data—sometimes as little as 10 megabytes of data gathered from a single network user and a few seconds of processing on a modern laptop.</p><p>Bottom line: Go ahead and encrypt your network data, but use WPA rather than WEP if you possibly can. Encrypted data is more secure than plaintext transmission, and it takes time to crack a WEP key, so WEP does add another (extremely weak) layer of security, especially if you change keys frequently. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1299"/>WEP encryption might not do much to protect you against serious attackers, but it will probably keep out the casual network eavesdropper who stumbles onto your network from across the street and the drive-by network snoop. It's a lot easier to break into an unencrypted network (and there are still plenty of them out there), so a cracker who detects your encrypted signal will probably move on to a target with less protection.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="wpa_encryption-id001"/>WPA Encryption</h2></div></div></div><p>WPA encryption was developed as a partial solution to the security problems that make WEP encryption less than totally secure. WPA is much safer than WEP, but cracking WPA is still possible.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1300"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm12_d1e13589"/></p><p>WPA is more secure because it uses a method called <span class="emphasis"><em>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)</em></span> to automatically change the encryption key after a specified period of time or after the system exchanges a specific number of packets. Because WPA changes the key frequently, it's a lot more difficult <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1301"/>for a cracker to gather enough information to decipher its encryption code.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1302"/></p><p>In large networks, WPA uses an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1303"/>authentication server to verify the identity of each network user. The server uses <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1304"/>Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1305"/>RADIUS) and the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1306"/>Extensible Authentication Protocol (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1307"/>EAP) to exchange encryption keys with the computers and other devices that are connected to the wireless network.</p><p>In home networks and smaller business networks that don't have a server, a method called <span class="emphasis"><em>pre-shared key (PSK) mode</em></span> uses a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1308"/>passphrase stored in the access point in place of the authentication server. To connect to the network, users must enter the same passphrase on their computers or other network devices (or set their devices to automatically enter the passphrase). When you set up <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1309"/>WPA encryption, you must specify whether the network uses a server or PSK mode.</p><p>Any access point and network adapter that supports 802.11g or 802.11n should also recognize WPA encryption. If you're using an older 802.11b or 802.11a access point, it might still be possible to add WPA encryption by installing the latest versions of firmware and drivers. Look in the support or downloads section of the manufacturer's website for free upgrade instructions and software.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="psk_passphrases"/>PSK Passphrases</h3></div></div></div><p>A WPA-PSK passphrase can be a string of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or 64 hexadecimal digits. The passphrase that you enter into a network device must be exactly the same as the one stored in the access point. Obviously, typing 64 digits correctly is not something that you want to do frequently, so the ASCII alternative is the better choice for most users. For optimal security, the ASCII passphrase you assign to your network should be a random mixture of at least 20 characters including letters (capitals and lower case), numbers, and punctuation marks.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1310"/></p><p>A PSK network uses the passphrase to set up the initial connection between a client (such as a computer or PDA) and the access point. After the connection is in place, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1311"/>TKIP assigns new encryption keys to every packet or group of packets.</p><p>The PSK combines with your network SSID to calculate the final key value. It is important to choose a unique SSID and a strong passphrase. Attackers can build large tables of SSID and PSK pairs for common network names and dictionary words, performing weeks of calculation once with the payoff of nearly instantly determining the key of any network that matches that pair of values. Choosing strong <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1312"/>passphrases and unique SSIDs can mitigate this type of attack.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="using_wpa_encryption"/>Using WPA Encryption</h3></div></div></div><p>When you set up a new network, the security section of the access point's configuration software will ask if you want to use encryption, and if so, whether you want WEP or WPA encryption. Unless you're planning to run an open-access network, you should choose WPA.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1313"/></p><p>In many cases, the access point will offer two or more types of WPA encryption. If your network includes a RADIUS server, choose EAP. If the network has no encryption server, use the WPA-TKIP option.</p><p>For a network user, providing a WPA key is just as easy as providing a WEP key. Most network adapters made in the last few years automatically recognize the type of encryption embedded in each <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1314"/>Wi-Fi signal that they detect, so the control program might ask for an encryption key without specifying whether it's a WEP key or a WPA key.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="wpa_security"/>WPA Security</h3></div></div></div><p>It was probably inevitable that somebody would take the added security features in WPA encryption as a challenge and develop a WPA cracking tool. Several such tools are out there, so WPA does not provide the impenetrable protection that some of its proponents might want you to believe. In particular, programs called <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1315"/>coWPAtty and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1316"/>Aircrack-ng both use <span class="emphasis"><em>dictionary attacks</em></span> on WPA-TKIP networks to try thousands or millions of possible keys until it finds the correct ones. Because each additional letter, number, or other character in a key increases the key's complexity, a long key takes much longer to crack than a short one. This kind of cracking technique takes time because the programs can only try about 50 different encryption keys per second, but eventually, they will find the right passphrase and connect to the target network.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1317"/></p><p>Fortunately, neither of these programs or any of the others aimed at cracking WPA encryption are easy to use, and they can take a lot of time to crack a network, so successful attacks on WPA are not particularly common. It might not be possible or practical to completely protect yourself against attacks, but a long passphrase that includes random numbers and punctuation marks in odd places is usually a better choice than a string of words or numbers alone. In other words, something like <span class="emphasis"><em>hdt%mzx33wolf$fgilxxq&amp;#smedbxor</em></span> is a better passphrase than <span class="emphasis"><em>nostarchpressbooks</em></span>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="access_control_mac_authentication"/>Access Control (MAC Authentication)</h2></div></div></div><p>Most access points include an option that permits the network manager to restrict access to a specific list of client adapters. If a network device with a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1318"/>MAC address that does not appear on the list of authorized users tries to connect, the access point will not accept the request to associate with the network. This can keep intruders from connecting to a wireless LAN, but it forces the network administrator to keep a complete list of users' adapters and their MAC addresses. Every time a new user wants to join the network, and every time an established user swaps adapters or gets a new laptop, PDA, or other device with a built-in adapter, the network manager must add one more <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1319"/>MAC address to the list. This is probably manageable in a home or small office network, but it could be a major undertaking for a larger corporate or campus-wide system, if it's practical at all.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1320"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1321"/></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1322"/>MAC <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1323"/>authentication does not provide unbreakable protection against unauthorized users because a determined cracker could monitor radio signals from approved users, intercept their adapters' MAC addresses, and load an approved address onto a different adapter. But combined with encryption and other security tools, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1324"/>authentication adds one more impediment in the path of a network cracker.</p><p>Every access point configuration utility uses a different format for its access lists. The manual and online documentation supplied with your access point should provide detailed instructions for creating and maintaining an <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1325"/>access control list.</p><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1326"/>Wi-Fi standards do not specify a maximum size for an access point's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1327"/>access control list, so the numbers are all over the map. Some access points limit the list to a few dozen entries, but others, such as the Proxim <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1328"/>Harmony AP Controller, will support as many as 10,000 separate addresses. Still others accept an unlimited number. If you plan to use a list of addresses to control access to your network, make sure your access point will work with a large enough list to support all of your users, with enough expansion space for future growth. As a rule of thumb, the access point should accept at least twice as many MAC addresses as the number of users on your network today.</p><p>Some access points also include a MAC address <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1329"/>exclusion feature that allows the network manager to block one or more MAC addresses from access to the network.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="virtual_private_networks"/>Virtual Private Networks</h2></div></div></div><p>Virtual private networks can add one more layer of useful security by isolating the connection between network nodes from other network traffic.

The 802.1x standard defines a structure that can support several additional forms of authentication, including certificates, smart cards, and one-time passwords, all of which offer more protection than the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1331"/>access control built into 802.11. In 802.11 networks, a technique called the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1332"/>Robust Security Network builds upon the 802.1x framework to restrict network access to authorized devices.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1333"/></p><p>Most end users need to know two things about <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1334"/>802.1x: First, it's built into some (but not all) <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1335"/>Wi-Fi hardware and software, including the wireless configuration utility supplied with Windows XP and many recent access point products, so it can provide one more potential layer of security; and second, it has serious flaws that a dedicated network cracker can exploit to break into a wireless network.

If they can't use your network to download files or connect to their favorite web pages, they'll probably move on to find some other unprotected wireless hot spot. That doesn't mean you should store confidential data in file shares on unprotected computers, but if you can limit or restrict access to the Internet, it will make your wireless network a lot less attractive to intruders.</p><p>A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1341"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1342"/>firewall in a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1343"/>wireless network can <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1344"/>perform several functions: It acts as a gateway router between the wireless network and a wired LAN or a direct connection to the Internet, blocking all traffic moving from the wireless side to the wired network that doesn't come from an authenticated user, but it does not interfere with commands, messages, and file transfers from trusted users. Therefore, a legitimate user can connect to network nodes on the wired part of a mixed LAN or onto the Internet, but an intruder would be cut off at the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1345"/>firewall.</p><p>Because authorized users and intruders are both on the unprotected side of the firewall, it does not isolate wireless nodes from one another. An intruder can still gain access to another computer on the same wireless network and read shared files, so it's a good idea to turn off file sharing in any computer connected to a wireless network.</p><p>A firewall for a wireless network should use some kind of authentication to allow legitimate users through the gateway, but it should reject everybody else. If the access control based on MAC addresses is built into Wi-Fi networks, and the added authentication in 802.1x is not adequate, then an outboard firewall should require each user to enter a login and password before they can connect to the Internet.</p><p>If your wireless network includes computers running more than one operating system, your firewall must use a login tool that works on any platform. The easiest way to accomplish this is with a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1346"/>web-based authentication server, such as the one included in the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1347"/>Apache webserver (<a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org">http://httpd.apache.org</a>).</p><p>The Apache webserver is available as a Unix application that can run on an old, slow computer with an early Pentium, or even a 486 CPU, so it's often possible to recycle an old junker that is no longer in daily service and use it as a firewall. Both the Apache application and a Unix operating system are available as open source software, so it ought to be possible to build an Apache firewall at extremely low cost.</p><p>If you prefer to use Windows rather than Unix, or if you don't want to assemble your own firewall, you have several options.

The firewall normally blocks all incoming requests for data to network hosts, but this creates problems when you want to use one or more of the computers on the local network as fileservers. So the firewall includes a virtual server that redirects certain types of requests to the appropriate computer inside the firewall.</p><p>Each request <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1353"/>for connection to a server includes a specific port number that identifies the type of server. For example, webservers operate on port 80, and FTP servers use port 21, so those <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1354"/>port numbers are part of the request <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1355"/>for access. To accept requests for access to a server, you must instruct the firewall's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1356"/>Network Address Translation (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1357"/>NAT) function to forward those requests to a specific computer within the LAN.

A webserver on 192.168.0.23 today won't migrate to 192.168.0.47 next week. That's generally not a problem on a wired network, but in a wireless setting where network clients join and depart the network all the time, the DHCP server automatically assigns the next available address to each new client. If one of those clients is also the home of one of the network's service ports, the NAT probably won't find it. This is not a common problem because most networks don't use portable computers as servers, but it can happen. The solution is either to turn off the DHCP server and assign a permanent IP address to each client or move the service port to a computer than has a wired connection to the network and assign a fixed IP address with a number at the high end of the DHCP range (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1359"/>for example, if the range of addresses assigned by the DHCP is from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200, set the server's address as 192.168.1.199).</p><div class="table"><a id="common_tcpip_service_port_numbers"/><p class="title"><b>Table 12-1. Common TCP/IP Service Port Numbers</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " summary="Common TCP/IP Service Port Numbers"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Port Number</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Internet Service</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>20</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>FTP-Data (FTP Default Data)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>21</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>FTP (File Transfer)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>23</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Telnet</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>25</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>SMTP (Outgoing Mail)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>37</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Time</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>53</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>DNS (Domain Name System)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>70</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Gopher</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>79</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Finger</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>80</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>HTTP (Webserver)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>88</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Kerberos</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>110</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>POP 3 (Incoming Mail)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>119</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>NNTP (Network News)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1863</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Microsoft MSN Messenger</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>5190</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>AOL Instant Messenger</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>7070</p></td><td style=""><p>Real Audio and Video</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"/></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="firewall_software"/>Firewall Software</h2></div></div></div><p>A wireless gateway firewall at the interface between the access point and the wired part of your LAN will keep intruders from using your network to reach the Internet, and a firewall at the Internet connection will turn away attempts to connect to your network <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the Internet, but there's still one more form of protection necessary in a wireless network.

If you and your family, or the people in your office are not using your Wi-Fi network, there's usually no reason to let anybody else use it, especially without your permission or knowledge. When you leave home for a few days, or even a few hours, or when you are done with your computers for the night, you can shut down your wireless network by disconnecting the power connector on the access point or using a power strip to turn off power to all of your computers and peripheral devices, including the network access point. When you want to use the computer and the network again, reconnect the power connector or turn on the power strip. Remember to wait until the lights on your DSL or cable modem and wireless access point stop flashing before you try to use the network.</p><p>This technique has the added benefit of reducing the amount of electric power the access point and other devices consume. Neither the access point nor any of your other equipment uses more than a watt or two when they're idle, but if you reduce that number to zero, you might see a small reduction in your monthly electric bill.</p></div>

It's easy enough to gain access to a network using off-the-shelf equipment that hasn't already been configured for that network; it's even easier when the intruder has stolen a laptop from an authorized user. Losing a laptop computer to a thief is bad enough. Letting the thief use a stolen computer to log in to a network is even worse. As a network operator, you should remind your users that their portables are attractive targets for thieves, and offer some guidelines for protecting them. As a user yourself, you should follow the same precautions.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1386"/></p><p>The first rule is simple: Don't forget that you're carrying a computer. It seems obvious, but London taxi drivers found about 2,900 laptops (and 62,000 mobile phones!) left in their cabs during a six-month period. Uncounted others have been abandoned in airplanes, hotel rooms, commuter trains, and conference centers. It doesn't take a thief to separate a computer from its owner if the owner just walks away.</p><p>Don't advertise the fact that you're carrying a computer. Those nylon bags that say <span class="emphasis"><em>IBM</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>COMPAQ</em></span> on the side in great big letters might be handy, but they're not as safe as an ordinary briefcase or a conservative carrier bag.</p><p>Next, keep your laptop in your hands or on your shoulder whenever it's not locked in a closet or storage locker. Look away for a minute, and a skilled thief can make it disappear. Airport terminals, railway stations, and hotel lobbies are common places for quick snatch-and-grabs. If you have to use the computer in a public space, use a lock with a steel cable to secure it to an immovable object.</p><p>Don't leave an unsecured laptop computer in an office overnight.</p><p>Watch out for airport <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1387"/>scanners. Make sure you're able to retrieve the computer as soon as it comes off the conveyor belt. Two people working together can do a fine job of delaying you and grabbing the computer before you can get to it. If somebody tries to steal your computer from a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1388"/>security check, make some noise and get help from the security guards.</p><p>Make sure your computers and loose components like PC Cards have property labels both inside and out.

You'll need that information for your police report and your insurance claim.</p><p>When you discover that one <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-1400"/>of the computers that uses your wireless network has been lost or stolen, it's essential to protect the rest of the network. If possible, change the network's passwords and encryption keys as soon as you can.

Some tools (such as ArpWatch for Linux) provide a mechanism for watching for specific MAC addresses and raising an alert when it detects one of those addresses.</p></div>

Engineers from interested hardware and software companies gather under the flag of an IEEE task force to develop yet another new set of network security tools to make their products safe from hackers, crackers, eavesdroppers, and other miscreants—and a few months later, an independent researcher at some university or government agency discovers that the new tools have their own serious problems that expose the "protected" data to break-ins and leaks, and yet another cracking program shows up on the Internet, "just to demonstrate the concept." In the meantime, the poor end users of the world are running as fast as they can to keep up, but their wireless networks still aren't completely secure.</p><p>If you look at wireless security as a cat-and-mouse game, it's pretty clear that the mice (or is it the cats?) need some sophisticated knowledge and equipment to work around the existing encryption and authentication tools. On the other hand, some of the most advanced tools are freely available to anyone with an Internet connection.</p><p>What to do? Is a secure wireless network an unreachable goal? Don't give up hope. WPA encryption is secure enough to keep most intruders out of the vast majority of Wi-Fi networks, and the additional security features included in the new 802.11n specification will provide even more protection. If that's not good enough, you can add a VPN to provide yet another layer of security for your data.</p><p>Think of wireless security like the front door to your house: If you leave the door wide open, anybody can walk in and steal your stuff. But when you lock the door and latch all the windows, it will be <span class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> more difficult for a burglar to enter. An expert can pick the lock, but that takes a lot of time and trouble, and most thieves will look for an unprotected house instead.</p></div></body></html>
