- en: In addition to Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation runs several other projects
    to produce free-content reference material. Commonly known within Wikimedia as
    *sister projects, sibling projects*, or simply *the projects*, the nine current
    Wikimedia projects are Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikisource,
    Wikiquote, Wikispecies, Wikiversity, and the Wikimedia Commons. Each project handles
    a different type of material, from textbooks to images, and each has a separate
    group of volunteers working on a dedicated wiki, usually with many language versions.
    The Wikimedia Foundation also coordinates the MediaWiki software that all of the
    projects run on. Often thought of as the tenth sister project, the MediaWiki software
    development process will be described more in the next chapter. The Meta-Wiki
    site, also described in the next chapter, serves as a coordination site for all
    of the projects and languages. Volunteers produce the content for all Wikimedia
    projects using a wiki model similar to Wikipedia's, and all of the projects license
    their content under the GFDL or another free license.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These different wiki projects all complement each other. The intention is to
    separate out *types* of content, such as dictionary definitions, encyclopedia
    articles, and archival material, while allowing *crosslinking* between the projects
    topic by topic. For instance, you would add quotations related to Abraham Lincoln
    to Wikiquote, and the Wikipedia article [[Abraham Lincoln]] can link to that store
    of quotations, rather than trying to include them all. With over 500 sites involved—nine
    sister projects, each with a large number of language versions—a systematic naming
    system to enable linking is obviously needed. We'll explain how this works in
    "Linking Between Projects and Copying Content," on [Linking Between Projects and
    Copying Content](hw-wkpd-wk_20.html "Linking Between Projects and Copying Content").

- en: 'All of these projects use the MediaWiki wiki software, so you don''t have to
    learn new editing processes to contribute to them; all you need to learn are some
    different namespace and page structure conventions. Don''t expect every project
    to have the full development seen now on Wikipedia, however, because the projects
    were started at different times and develop at their own (sometimes leisurely)
    pace. Additionally, you shouldn''t assume that Wikipedia culture (particularly
    English-language Wikipedia culture) transfers automatically to these other projects.
    Each project, and each language version of each project, can and should be thought
    of as a community in its own right. Each has its own policies and variations in
    how processes, such as deletion debates and promotion of administrators, are handled.
    Watch for and learn the norms of each new project when you start to participate.
    But each project has some familiar features: help pages and some variation on
    a community portal and a village pump for discussing and coordinating the project.
    Just as on Wikipedia, these are good places to begin learning more. Wikimedia
    projects all share some key values, too. Civility and assuming good faith are
    always important when interacting with other editors, and copyright violations
    are *never* acceptable on any of the projects. And naturally, all projects are
    open for editing by anyone. Just find a task you want to work on and start editing,
    either anonymously or logged in with a user account.'

- en: In the past, it has been necessary to create a new account on each Wikimedia
    project you edited, which occasionally led to different people having the same
    name on different projects. As of mid-2008, single-user login is being implemented,
    making it possible to register your account "globally" across all Wikimedia accounts.
    Simply register your name on your home project. Then to "claim" it for other projects,
    go to [[Special:MergeAccount]] on your home project, or click Manage Your Global
    Account under your preferences when logged in. Once you merge your accounts, your
    chosen username will be reserved for your use on any Wikimedia project, enabling
    you to log in and out of all Wikimedia projects at once. To avoid naming conflict
    with others on other wikis, you may need to pick a distinctive username or use
    your full name.

    "Figure 16-1. The English-language main page for Commons")) because the Commons
    is considered an integral part of Wikipedia operations these days, as well as
    a worthwhile and popular site in its own right, ranking among the top 300 websites
    worldwide. The Commons is a repository of free media, including images (both photographs
    and illustrations), sound files, animations, and video clips. If you produce images
    for the encyclopedia, you are strongly encouraged to create an account for uploading
    your images directly to Commons. Like other Wikimedia content, all Commons media
    are both free and freely licensed, but the *free license* guidelines are stricter
    on Commons than on the English-language Wikipedia, as fair-use materials are excluded
    completely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can link directly to images and other content on Commons from any language
    version of any Wikimedia project, without having to upload that media separately
    to each project. For instance, you can easily insert a picture in a Wikipedia
    article that is actually hosted on Commons (rather than on the English-language
    Wikipedia itself). By comparison, when you upload an image to the English-language
    Wikipedia, you can only link to it from within the English-language Wikipedia.
    Wikimedia Commons was founded in 2004 in order to remove some obvious redundancy
    among the other Wikimedia projects, such as having multiple images of the same
    thing on different Wikipedias. Commons can be thought of as a kind of stock photography
    archive of free materials, designed for the other Wikimedia projects and for anyone
    searching for free media. The other advantages of using Commons are apparent when
    you want to sort and search for media. Commons is also useful for consolidating
    media efforts, such as projects to take pictures or make sound files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    descriptions may be in any language, and the Commons main page interface and welcome

    been uploaded by mid-2008.

    To begin searching on Commons, use the left sidebar search box or the search box
    in the upper-right corner of the main page ([Figure 16-1](#the_english-language_main_page_for_commo
    "Figure 16-1. The English-language main page for Commons")). This searches through
    filenames, file descriptions, gallery pages, and category names. As with Wikipedia's
    search, you can choose to search specific namespaces by checking the boxes for
    those namespaces at the bottom of your search results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main namespace on Commons, equivalent to the Article namespace on Wikipedia,
    is often called the *Gallery* namespace; use this namespace for producing *galleries*,
    or collections of images. The Gallery namespace does not have a special prefix.
    Galleries provide a way to group related images together, making them similar
    to Wikipedia's lists. If a gallery page with a name matching your search terms
    exists, this page will be displayed first in the search results.

    report and summarize news on all subjects from a neutral point of view, providing
    a free-content alternative to proprietary news agencies. Anyone can contribute,
    either from direct experience or by summarizing from elsewhere. In terms of content
    policy, Neutral Point of View (NPOV) and Verifiability (V) apply to content on
    Wikinews, but Wikinews differs from Wikipedia in that original reporting is welcomed.
    The site aims to provide a stable news source, so after articles have been drafted,
    they are published, with the expectation that major changes will not be made to
    the article once they have been published for 36 hours. After a week, articles
    are archived and "frozen" (protected against further editing).'

    link to the appropriate Wikinews story, if one exists. Wikinews articles may be
    cited in Wikipedia articles. Breaking news is better suited to Wikinews, but you
    will often see stories about current events developing in both places simultaneously.
    Wikinews is better for some topics, however; a person may be briefly "in the news"
    as reported on Wikinews, without meriting a biography in Wikipedia. Also unlike
    Wikipedia (and the rest of the Wikimedia projects), Wikinews uses the Creative
    Commons Attribution 2.5 license, which is also a free license. This means that
    content from Wikipedia generally cannot be copied directly to Wikinews, however.

    a demonstration wiki was established in November 2004 to show how such a collaborative
    news site might work. In December 2004, the site was moved out of the demo stage
    and into the beta stage. A German-language edition was launched at the same time.
    Soon editions in Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Polish, Portuguese,
    Romanian, Ukrainian, Italian, Serbian, Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai,
    Norwegian, and Chinese (in that chronological order) were set up; currently Wikinews
    has sites in 23 languages altogether.

    that you wish to link to on that page. This is simple and intuitive enough: [[Wikiquote:Lord
    Byron]] is the page for quotes relating to Lord Byron. Notice that no indicator
    is included about which language version of Wikiquote you are linking to; if you
    don''t specify a language, the link will go to the equivalent project in the same
    language you''re linking from. For instance, if you include the Lord Byron link
    on the English-language Wikipedia, clicking it will take you to the English-language
    Wikiquote page for Lord Byron. After all, most of the time that would be what
    you wanted to achieve.'

    that have been set up for this purpose. On Wikipedia, this is the preferred way
    to provide such links. The advantage of using a template is that the resulting
    link is set apart in a box with the logo of the project being linked to and some
    explanatory text. You will generally see these templates at the bottom of articles
    when they are included, in the Further reading or External links section, though
    they can appear anywhere throughout an article; for instance, a template linking
    to Wikiquote may appear in the Quotes section of a Wikipedia article.

    few special ones, they link to a search for the parameter name (usually an article

    be appropriate for one of the sister projects. For instance, a dictionary definition
    doesn't belong on Wikipedia—but would be great at Wiktionary. These pages are
    candidates for being copied to another project. The jargon *transwiki* applies
    to moves of material from one wiki to another. The term is appropriate for pages
    from any namespace that need to be moved to another Wikimedia project; for instance,
    technical help pages might need to be transwikied to MediaWiki, whereas Foundation-wide
    pages might need to be moved to the Meta site.

    used for all sorts of applications, both private and public, and many interesting
    wiki communities that aren't affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation have been
    created. These wikis may explore a topic area in more depth than Wikipedia does
    or provide a place for reviews and commentary that would violate Wikipedia's content
    policies. If what you want to work on doesn't seem like a good match with Wikipedia
    or any of the sister projects, try looking for another non-Wikimedia wiki instead.

    built wikis. Some wikis have a particular political orientation or are meant to
    document a particular project or piece of software. Large wikis exist that aim
    to build worldwide travel guides (such as [http://wikitravel.org/](http://wikitravel.org/))
    or collect comprehensive how-to guides for every topic area (such as [http://wikihow.org/](http://wikihow.org/)).
    A movement is growing to start wikis for individual towns and communities and
    collect useful information about that place for residents and visitors. Some wikis
    even provide variations on the idea of building an encyclopedia. Many of these
    sites are commercial, while others may be nonprofit; many use an open content
    license. A directory of wiki sites can be found at [http://www.wikindex.com/](http://www.wikindex.com/).
    Wikipedia itself comes through with the [[List of wikis]], which is sorted by
    type. Other wiki sites may be very different both technically and socially from
    Wikimedia sites and Wikipedia, but the basic ideas we've presented in this book,
    of editing and interacting respectfully, should apply to every wiki.

    Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, and Angela Beesley, who has served on the
    Wikimedia Foundation Board, founded Wikia in 2004\. Wikia, Inc., is independent
    from the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikia does share with Wikimedia a reliance on the
    MediaWiki software and the GFDL license (except for Memory Alpha, a Star Trek
    wiki, which uses a Creative Commons license). Wikia sites are generally supported
    with ads. See [http://wikia.com/](http://wikia.com/) for more information.

    for a new Wikimedia project, see the next chapter for how to make a proposal.
    New Wikimedia projects are started slowly, however, and for most specific wiki
    ideas, either finding an existing project to join or starting your own is best.
    Are you interested in starting a wiki for your own purposes? You should keep a
    few factors in mind. For instance, are you willing and able to take on the technical
    maintenance yourself? How much are you willing to pay for software and hosting?
    Most importantly, for what purpose are you building a wiki? Consider whether the
    wiki is intended for a few collaborators on a particular project or as a larger
    community site. Who are your potential audience and editors?
