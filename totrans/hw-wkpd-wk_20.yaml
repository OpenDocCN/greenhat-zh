- en: In addition to Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation runs several other projects
    to produce free-content reference material. Commonly known within Wikimedia as
    *sister projects, sibling projects*, or simply *the projects*, the nine current
    Wikimedia projects are Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikisource,
    Wikiquote, Wikispecies, Wikiversity, and the Wikimedia Commons. Each project handles
    a different type of material, from textbooks to images, and each has a separate
    group of volunteers working on a dedicated wiki, usually with many language versions.
    The Wikimedia Foundation also coordinates the MediaWiki software that all of the
    projects run on. Often thought of as the tenth sister project, the MediaWiki software
    development process will be described more in the next chapter. The Meta-Wiki
    site, also described in the next chapter, serves as a coordination site for all
    of the projects and languages. Volunteers produce the content for all Wikimedia
    projects using a wiki model similar to Wikipedia's, and all of the projects license
    their content under the GFDL or another free license.

  zh: 除了维基百科之外，维基媒体基金会还运行了其他几个项目，以生产免费内容参考材料。在维基媒体内部通常被称为*姐妹项目、兄弟项目*或简单地称为*项目*，目前有九个维基媒体项目：维基百科、维基词典、维基新闻、维基教科书、维基源、维基语录、维基物种、维基大学和维基共享资源。每个项目处理不同类型的内容，从教科书到图片，每个项目都有独立的志愿者团队在专门的维基上工作，通常有多个语言版本。维基媒体基金会还协调所有项目运行的MediaWiki软件。通常被认为是第十个姐妹项目的MediaWiki软件开发过程将在下一章中详细介绍。下一章还将描述的Meta-Wiki网站，作为所有项目和语言的协调站点。志愿者使用类似于维基百科的维基模式为所有维基媒体项目制作内容，所有项目的内容都根据GFDL或另一个免费许可证进行许可。
- en: These different wiki projects all complement each other. The intention is to
    separate out *types* of content, such as dictionary definitions, encyclopedia
    articles, and archival material, while allowing *crosslinking* between the projects
    topic by topic. For instance, you would add quotations related to Abraham Lincoln
    to Wikiquote, and the Wikipedia article [[Abraham Lincoln]] can link to that store
    of quotations, rather than trying to include them all. With over 500 sites involved—nine
    sister projects, each with a large number of language versions—a systematic naming
    system to enable linking is obviously needed. We'll explain how this works in
    "Linking Between Projects and Copying Content," on [Linking Between Projects and
    Copying Content](hw-wkpd-wk_20.html "Linking Between Projects and Copying Content").

  zh: 这些不同的维基项目相互补充。目的是将不同类型的内容分开，例如词典定义、百科全书文章和档案材料，同时允许项目之间按主题进行交叉链接。例如，你可以在维基语录中添加与亚伯拉罕·林肯相关的引语，而维基百科上的[[亚伯拉罕·林肯]]文章可以链接到这些引语库，而不是试图将它们全部包含在内。由于涉及超过500个网站——九个姐妹项目，每个项目都有大量的语言版本——因此需要一个系统化的命名系统来支持链接。我们将在“项目之间的链接和内容复制”中解释这是如何工作的，请参阅[项目之间的链接和内容复制](hw-wkpd-wk_20.html
    "项目之间的链接和内容复制")。
- en: 'All of these projects use the MediaWiki wiki software, so you don''t have to
    learn new editing processes to contribute to them; all you need to learn are some
    different namespace and page structure conventions. Don''t expect every project
    to have the full development seen now on Wikipedia, however, because the projects
    were started at different times and develop at their own (sometimes leisurely)
    pace. Additionally, you shouldn''t assume that Wikipedia culture (particularly
    English-language Wikipedia culture) transfers automatically to these other projects.
    Each project, and each language version of each project, can and should be thought
    of as a community in its own right. Each has its own policies and variations in
    how processes, such as deletion debates and promotion of administrators, are handled.
    Watch for and learn the norms of each new project when you start to participate.
    But each project has some familiar features: help pages and some variation on
    a community portal and a village pump for discussing and coordinating the project.
    Just as on Wikipedia, these are good places to begin learning more. Wikimedia
    projects all share some key values, too. Civility and assuming good faith are
    always important when interacting with other editors, and copyright violations
    are *never* acceptable on any of the projects. And naturally, all projects are
    open for editing by anyone. Just find a task you want to work on and start editing,
    either anonymously or logged in with a user account.'

    project you edited, which occasionally led to different people having the same
    name on different projects. As of mid-2008, single-user login is being implemented,
    making it possible to register your account "globally" across all Wikimedia accounts.
    Simply register your name on your home project. Then to "claim" it for other projects,
    go to [[Special:MergeAccount]] on your home project, or click Manage Your Global
    Account under your preferences when logged in. Once you merge your accounts, your
    chosen username will be reserved for your use on any Wikimedia project, enabling
    you to log in and out of all Wikimedia projects at once. To avoid naming conflict
    with others on other wikis, you may need to pick a distinctive username or use
    your full name.

    "Figure 16-1. The English-language main page for Commons")) because the Commons
    is considered an integral part of Wikipedia operations these days, as well as
    a worthwhile and popular site in its own right, ranking among the top 300 websites
    worldwide. The Commons is a repository of free media, including images (both photographs
    and illustrations), sound files, animations, and video clips. If you produce images
    for the encyclopedia, you are strongly encouraged to create an account for uploading
    your images directly to Commons. Like other Wikimedia content, all Commons media
    are both free and freely licensed, but the *free license* guidelines are stricter
    on Commons than on the English-language Wikipedia, as fair-use materials are excluded
    completely.

  zh: 在所有姐妹项目中，我们首先突出显示维基媒体 Commons（[图 16-1](#the_english-language_main_page_for_commo
    "图 16-1. Commons 的英文主页"）），因为如今 Commons 被视为维基百科运营的一个不可或缺的部分，同时也是一个值得和受欢迎的网站，在全球排名前
    300 的网站中。Commons 是免费媒体的存储库，包括图像（照片和插图）、声音文件、动画和视频剪辑。如果你为百科全书制作图像，强烈建议你创建一个账户，以便直接将图像上传到
    Commons。与其他维基媒体内容一样，所有 Commons 媒体都是免费且自由许可的，但 Commons 上的*自由许可*指南比英文维基百科上的更严格，因为完全排除了合理使用材料。
- en: You can link directly to images and other content on Commons from any language
    version of any Wikimedia project, without having to upload that media separately
    to each project. For instance, you can easily insert a picture in a Wikipedia
    article that is actually hosted on Commons (rather than on the English-language
    Wikipedia itself). By comparison, when you upload an image to the English-language
    Wikipedia, you can only link to it from within the English-language Wikipedia.
    Wikimedia Commons was founded in 2004 in order to remove some obvious redundancy
    among the other Wikimedia projects, such as having multiple images of the same
    thing on different Wikipedias. Commons can be thought of as a kind of stock photography
    archive of free materials, designed for the other Wikimedia projects and for anyone
    searching for free media. The other advantages of using Commons are apparent when
    you want to sort and search for media. Commons is also useful for consolidating
    media efforts, such as projects to take pictures or make sound files.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []

  zh: 你可以从任何语言版本的任何维基媒体项目中直接链接到 Commons 上的图像和其他内容，而无需分别将媒体上传到每个项目。例如，你可以轻松地在维基百科文章中插入实际上托管在
    Commons 上的图片（而不是在英文维基百科本身上）。相比之下，当你将图像上传到英文维基百科时，你只能从英文维基百科内部链接到它。维基媒体 Commons
    于 2004 年成立，旨在消除其他维基媒体项目之间的一些明显冗余，例如在不同维基百科上对同一事物的多个图像。Commons 可以被视为一种免费材料的库存摄影档案，旨在为其他维基媒体项目和任何寻找免费媒体的人设计。当你想要对媒体进行排序和搜索时，使用
    Commons 的其他优势就显而易见了。Commons 还有助于整合媒体工作，例如拍照或制作声音文件的项目。
- en: Because all the language projects may use it, Commons is multilingual; image
    descriptions may be in any language, and the Commons main page interface and welcome
    page has been translated into a few dozen languages (links appear at the top of
    the main page). Commons has been so successful that nearly 3,000,000 files had
    been uploaded by mid-2008.

    those namespaces at the bottom of your search results.

    Galleries provide a way to group related images together, making them similar
    to Wikipedia's lists. If a gallery page with a name matching your search terms

    types of content. The exception is Wikinews, which is a citizen journalism site
    now using a Creative Commons license. Six of the projects have versions in many
    languages, as Wikipedia does, with the exception of Wikispecies, which maintains
    a single site. You could think of MediaWiki software development as yet another
    sister project, with the obvious difference being that it exists to develop and
    distribute a program, not content.

    of full articles about a topic, Wiktionary provides concise word definitions.
    Wiktionary''s scope overlaps with Wikipedia: A term with an article in Wikipedia
    may also be defined in Wiktionary. For instance, whereas the Wikipedia fish article
    discusses types of fish, where they can be found, fishing methods, and so on,
    the Wiktionary definition will tell you that *fish* in English can be a noun or
    a verb, that a fish is a cold-blooded animal that lives in water, how to pronounce
    it, and so on. The English-language Wiktionary had over 878,000 entries as of
    mid-2008, though many of those had been imported from public-domain dictionaries

    should be neutral and verifiable. Although definitions and descriptions in the
    English-language Wiktionary are in English only, words from any and all languages
    can be included: Wiktionary not only defines English words but also serves as
    a French-English dictionary, a Spanish-English dictionary, and so on. Thus the
    site can be an excellent place to look up unfamiliar foreign words; as of 2008,
    words in 104 languages were included in the English-language Wiktionary. Additionally,
    when viewing an entry, the In Other Languages links on the left-hand sidebar will
    take you to definitions in other languages of the same English word (similarly

    report and summarize news on all subjects from a neutral point of view, providing

    either from direct experience or by summarizing from elsewhere. In terms of content
    policy, Neutral Point of View (NPOV) and Verifiability (V) apply to content on
    Wikinews, but Wikinews differs from Wikipedia in that original reporting is welcomed.
    The site aims to provide a stable news source, so after articles have been drafted,
    they are published, with the expectation that major changes will not be made to
    the article once they have been published for 36 hours. After a week, articles
    are archived and "frozen" (protected against further editing).'

    will often see stories about current events developing in both places simultaneously.
    Wikinews is better for some topics, however; a person may be briefly "in the news"
    as reported on Wikinews, without meriting a biography in Wikipedia. Also unlike
    Wikipedia (and the rest of the Wikimedia projects), Wikinews uses the Creative
    Commons Attribution 2.5 license, which is also a free license. This means that
    content from Wikipedia generally cannot be copied directly to Wikinews, however.

    and into the beta stage. A German-language edition was launched at the same time.
    Soon editions in Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Polish, Portuguese,
    Romanian, Ukrainian, Italian, Serbian, Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai,
    Norwegian, and Chinese (in that chronological order) were set up; currently Wikinews
    has sites in 23 languages altogether.

    with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Texts produced with OCR do

    do not write, plenty of work needs to be done. Tasks include proofreading uploaded
    texts, wikifying texts into MediaWiki format, categorizing, and uploading incomplete
    texts (because transcribing a long document onto the wiki can be a big job). Other
    possibilities include finding public domain texts, checking copyright status of
    submissions, and working on producing audio versions (such as audiobooks) of texts;
    you can find directions for creating audiobooks at [[s:Help:Audio]] and more open
    tasks at [[s:Community Portal]].

    otherwise important public domain texts, both as a supplement to Wikipedia and
    as an archive in its own right. For instance, the Wikipedia article on the US
    Constitution may link to the full text of the Constitution at Wikisource. This
    provides a valuable addition to the article for readers who want to learn more
    about the topic. Wikisource does have things in common with other free-text projects
    like Project Gutenberg, but the emphasis of Wikisource is on historical and culturally
    important material.

    ideas, either finding an existing project to join or starting your own is best.
    Are you interested in starting a wiki for your own purposes? You should keep a
    few factors in mind. For instance, are you willing and able to take on the technical
    maintenance yourself? How much are you willing to pay for software and hosting?
    Most importantly, for what purpose are you building a wiki? Consider whether the

    that aim to produce free-content, wiki-based reference materials: Wiktionary,
    Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikispecies, Wikiversity, and the
    Wikimedia Commons. These projects offer complementary content, and you can link
    pages between the different projects, providing a comprehensive reference resource
    about a topic.'
