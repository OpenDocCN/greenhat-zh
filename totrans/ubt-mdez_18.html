There are, however, other applications and even some extensions that you can add to your system that will provide still more around-the-house functionality. These include things that might not fit clearly in any of the preceding chapters but do fit under the home banner. Here you’ll learn about a number of these applications that can make your Ubuntu-powered machine a more thoroughly functioning part of your home life. All are available from the Ubuntu Software Center unless otherwise noted.</p><div class="sect1" title="Where the Apps Are"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_the_apps_are-id5"/>Where the Apps Are</h1></div></div></div><p>The apps in this chapter fall under a number of different categories. Instructions on how to find each of them in the Dash will be provided in the relevant sections. As with all applications, you can also run any of these apps by simply typing its name in the Dash’s search box and then pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="HomeBank"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="homebank"/>HomeBank</h1></div></div></div><p>Money makes the world go round, as the saying goes, and nowhere is that awareness more keen than at home. If you are looking for personal financial management software to make household budgeting a bit easier to deal with, then you’ll be happy to know that there are quite a few Linux offerings for you. The one that is probably easiest to use is called HomeBank (<a class="xref" href="ch18.html#home_money_management_with_homebank" title="Figure 18-1. Home money management with HomeBank">Figure 18-1</a>), which is also available for Windows and Mac OS systems. HomeBank sports a number of features, including the ability to show multiple accounts and generate reports and graphical charts. It can import and export files created by the popular finance programs Quicken (<span class="emphasis"><em>.qif</em></span>) and Intuit (<span class="emphasis"><em>.q fx</em></span>), and it can also import spreadsheet-generated comma-separated values (<span class="emphasis"><em>.csv</em></span>) files. Because it is a cross-platform application, it has a pretty good-sized user community out there, so you should be able to find help online easily if necessary. In fact, there are links to the HomeBank user manual, tutorials, FAQs, and community LaunchPad forum at <a class="ulink" href="http://homebank.free.fr/">http://homebank.free.fr/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0004"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="home_money_management_with_homebank"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject18_d1e18845"/><img alt="Home money management with HomeBank" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263958.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-1. Home money management with HomeBank</p></div><p>You can run HomeBank by going to the Dash and typing <strong class="userinput"><code>homebank</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span> or by clicking the Application lens in the Dash and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span> filter button.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 18A: Installing a Recipe Lens"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_18a_colon_installing_a_recipe_le"/>Project 18A: Installing a Recipe Lens</h1></div></div></div><p>Since we are on the topic of home, and no room signifies <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span> as much as the kitchen, we are going to make a little diversion into that sphere.

Most systems provide parents with a way to monitor this through parental control settings. There are a couple of parental control packages for Ubuntu. One, called Nanny, is in the Ubuntu Software Center but does not yet work with the new Ubuntu 12.04 release. Another, timekpr, can work after a bit of trickery at the command line but is not included in the Ubuntu Software Center. Nanny is useful in that it allows you to control web access, but since we want something that will work, we’ll settle for timekpr for now and just hope that Nanny is fixed in the near future (keep checking).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-18-0021"/></p><p>Before you can use timekpr, you will need to have separate standard (not administrator) accounts for your kids; otherwise, timekpr will not work. So, if you have not yet created user accounts for the kids, do that first (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Dressing Up the Bird">Chapter 9</a> if you need a review).</p><p>Once you’ve done that, you can move on to the first part of the project: creating a symbolic link that diverts timekpr from the support file it needs and is looking for (called GDM), which is no longer in Ubuntu, to another support file that is essentially the same thing, albeit with a another name (LDM), and is in Ubuntu. This is necessary because the version of timekpr you will be installing was prepared for the previous version of Ubuntu (Oneiric Ocelot). But don’t worry, the fix works, and it’s not difficult. Here are the steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Terminal (from the Dash, type <strong class="userinput"><code>terminal</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create the symbolic link by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo ln -s /etc/mdm /etc/gdm</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap">enter</span>.
