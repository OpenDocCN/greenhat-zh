    always promise that they're serving the voters' interests without revealing their
    own motives (Step 1). Then they appeal to the voters' trust by implying that they'll
    benefit if the particular politician is elected to office (Step 2). Finally, the
    politician appeals for the voters' support (Step 3), which leads to power and
    money for the politician. In the case of usual politics, the money goes toward
    promoting the politician's reelection and other political maneuvers. In the case
    of a crooked politician, the voters get conned and left with nothing.

    websites with legitimate-sounding names that accept online payments, such as transactions
    made through PayPal. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for example, website names
    that were not affiliated with any legitimate charities included [www.katrinareliefonline.org](http://www.katrinareliefonline.org),

    Such unsolicited email will often mention the name of a fake charity that's very

    legitimate American Cancer Society) or the National Heart Institute (instead of
    the legitimate American Heart Institute).

    email, and never provide your information to a telemarketer seeking donations
    over the phone. Because blanket telemarketing is expensive and time-consuming,
    few legitimate charities rely on it to raise money. A legitimate organization
    will provide a website or mailing address if you ask, and making this your standard
    procedure will ensure that you have the time and ability to investigate the charity.
    Before you make any donations, check out the charity's name. Bogus websites often
    create logos that look similar to those of legitimate charities. A simple search
    using Google or on the Better Business Bureau website ([www.bbb.com](http://www.bbb.com))
    will uncover well-known frauds. You can often tell a fake charity from a legitimate
    one by doing a WHOIS search ([www.networksolutions.com/whois](http://www.networksolutions.com/whois))
    on the domain name. If the WHOIS search reveals that the owner of the domain name
    is the charity you expected, such as the American Red Cross for the redcross.org
    domain name, as shown in [Figure 13-1](ch13.html#a_whois_search_can_reveal_the_true_owner
    "Figure 13-1. A WHOIS search can reveal the true owner behind charity domain names."),
    then the website is most likely legitimate. If the WHOIS search reveals an individual
    or an organization other than the charity promoted by the website, you might want
    to investigate the charity more closely before sending any money.

    chief executive of the United Way once pled guilty to stealing $500,000 from the
    charity, channeling donations into his own pockets instead of toward the worthy
    causes they were meant to support. So even if you give to a legitimate charitable
    organization, it's possible that your money will not help someone who actually
    needs it.

    that you've won a fabulous prize in a contest, or that your credit card was incorrectly
    charged, or that one of your relatives is in trouble—anything to prompt you to
    return the call or respond to the email.

    you on the phone as long as possible because (surprise!) the phone number is really
    a pay-per-call service (much like a 1-900 number) that charges you (the caller)
    astronomical rates, which can amount to as much as $25 per minute.
  prefs: []

    in the Caribbean. Thus, the scammer can avoid American laws, such as those requiring
    that he warn you in advance of the charges being incurred and state the per-minute
    rate involved, or that there must be a provision for terminating the call within
    a certain time period without being charged. However, because no international
    code is required to reach the phone number, most people won't even realize that
    they're making an international call.

    If you're foolish enough to send money to the con artist running this scam, you'll

    have sent thousands of dollars to these con artists while others have actually
    traveled to Nigeria to meet with the con artists in person. In 2003, a 72-year-old

    I used a Visual Basic disassembler to convert the program from an executable file
    back to its original Visual Basic source code, so I could see how it stored names
    and addresses and generated its "secret codes." Then, I wrote another Visual Basic
    3.0 program, dubbed Mega$Hack, that allowed users to edit any names and addresses
    stored in the Mega$Nets program and generate their own "secret codes" without
    paying a penny. By releasing the Mega$Hack program into the public domain and
    allowing skeptics to modify Mega$Nets for free, I hoped to foul up the Mega$Nets

    a former or current employee, a relative, even a complete stranger. However, few
    stalkers have the motivation to pick a stranger at random just so they can attack
    and harass someone they don't even know. In the majority of cases, stalkers know
    their victims. Some keep up the harassment for days, weeks, months, and, sometimes,
    even years.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are hurt or angry that the relationship with the victim is over. They try to extend
    the relationship through harassment (following the victim, hanging around the
    victim's home or workplace, sending letters or emails, constantly calling, etc.).
    In most cases, the stalker simply wants to revive the relationship and actually
    believes that stalking can make that dream come true.

    such as slashing tires or assaulting or killing his stalking target. Vengeful
    stalkers believe they are correcting some real, exaggerated, or even imaginary

    or hurt the victim.

    stalking on some imagined love for or anger toward the victim, they can be unpredictable
    and frightening. They may alternate between being nice and exploding into a sudden
    fit of rage. Typically delusional stalkers target high-profile victims such as
    movie stars or other types of celebrities, although it's still possible for a
    delusional stalker to be a coworker or someone else who has a genuine connection
    to the victim.

    poor personal hygiene, and an uneven job history. He often lives alone and rarely
    cleans or takes care of his home, clothes, or even himself. In general, he cares
    so little about himself that, not surprisingly, he doesn't care about anyone else
    either. Rather than learn the proper way to behave around others, he chooses to
    stalk someone. It's not necessarily a conscious or welcome choice on his part,
    but it's the only way he knows how to express his emotions, whether for good or
    bad.

- en: Stalkers have been around since long before the Internet, but cyberspace has
    given stalkers a new sense of power and anonymity along with the reach to harass
    victims anywhere in the world. In the old days, stalkers had to rely on making
    obscene phone calls or leaving notes in places where a victim might find them.
    Today, stalkers can do this electronically by sending a barrage of email or instant
    messages. Typically, these messages are designed to taunt or threaten the victim
    and create the impression that the stalker is always nearby, even if physically
    in another state or country.
  prefs: []

    turned on, to his ex-girlfriend's car. That way he could follow her movements
    at all times. If a stalker sends enough email or instant messages, he can flood
    the victim's computer with useless information and prevent her from receiving
    any legitimate communications. Some stalkers may try to infect a victim's computer
    with viruses, RATs (see [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Trojan Horses and Worms")),
    or spyware (see [Chapter 20](ch20.html "Chapter 20. Adware and Spyware")) to steal
    more information (such as credit card numbers or passwords), spy on that person's
    personal life and activities, or simply to foul up her computer.

    information through newsgroups or chat rooms. He might impersonate the victim
    to send bogus email or chat room messages to other people. By insulting or angering
    others under the guise of the victim, stalkers can confuse a victim, who will
    not know why or how so many other people seem to be turning against her for no
    apparent reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides insulting or embarrassing a victim, stalkers may try to set up a victim
    for harassment from others. For example, stalkers might give a victim's email
    address to spammers, thereby encouraging spammers to flood the victim's email
    account. A stalker might also give a victim's name, address, phone number, and
    email address to peculiar characters such as religious cults, sadomasochists,
    pedophiles, or other unsavory characters, who will then contact the unwitting
    victim, sowing further confusion and nuisances in the victim's life.

    this, stalkers can usually retrieve other types of information such as telephone

    has its own unique domain, such as [www.JohnDoe.com](http://www.johndoe.com),
    stalkers can do a WHOIS search to find the contact information registered for
    that site. [Figure 14-1](ch14s03.html#a_whois_search_on_a_descriptive_domain_n

    who fought for land and freedom for his people). All that changed on January 1,
    1994, when the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) declared war against
    the Mexican state and demanded the liberation of the people of Chiapas and Mexico.
    As part of the Zapatistas' war declaration, they explained how the state of Chiapas

    and unedited, but this newspaper rarely reached anyone outside of Mexico City.

    the Zapatistas' claims (to the embarrassment of the Mexican government), the Zapatista

    infrastructure using nothing more than a computer, well-crafted viruses or Trojan
    horses, and hacking skills. Examples of what cyberterrorism could accomplish range

    ballistic missile at the United States, it's also possible that such large, coordinated
    attacks on computer systems could be carried out. However, just as an actual attack
