- en: If you're standing in the aisle of your local bookstore reading this right now,
    you may well be wondering who this book is for. *Ubuntu for Non-Geeks*, as you
    might imagine, is for readers who are interested in Linux but who feel the need
    for a jumping-off point of sorts.

- en: If you're familiar with computers but unfamiliar with Linux, or if you are somewhat
    familiar with Linux but not with Ubuntu, this book is for you. This is not primarily
    a book for those seasoned geeks or power users; it's an introductory guide that
    will provide you with some hands-on experience that will get you up, running,
    and comfortable with the Ubuntu Linux distribution without pain. Think of this
    book as a map, a compass, and a comfy pair of hiking boots, rather than a harness,
    a rope, and a set of crampons.

- en: This fourth edition of *Ubuntu for Non-Geeks* is based on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid
    Lynx) Desktop edition. The CD bundled with this book is the Ubuntu Desktop CD,
    which lets you both try Ubuntu without installing it and install Ubuntu to your
    hard drive once you're ready. It's called a *live CD*. You can boot your computer
    from the CD and run Ubuntu directly off the CD without touching your hard disk
    so that you can see if you like Ubuntu and make sure that Ubuntu will work with
    your hardware. If, after running the live CD, you like what you see and everything
    seems to work, you can install Ubuntu on your computer using the same disc. (There
    are instructions for doing so in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. WADING AND
    DIVING").)
