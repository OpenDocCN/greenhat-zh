- en: Courier-IMAP is an open source IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server
    that functions in conjunction with an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) such as Postfix.
    Courier-IMAP provides access to Maildir mailboxes, a system for email storage
    first introduced in Qmail.

- en: Courier-IMAP also includes a POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) server that
    provides POP3 protocol access to Maildir mailboxes. POP3 is currently the most
    popular email retrieval protocol; virtually all email providers support it. A
    POP3 mail transaction consists of a client-initiated connection to the server,
    the downloading of messages, deletion of those messages from the server, and connection
    termination. This method of email retrieval is well suited to users who access
    their email from the same computer on a consistent basis, but it can be cumbersome
    for users who need email access from a variety of different computers (e.g., work,
    home, Internet café, etc.).

- en: IMAP was written by Mark Crispin in 1986 to provide an alternative to POP. Some
    advantages IMAP provides over POP are on-demand message downloading (only selected
    messages are downloaded to the client instead of the whole mailbox), support for
    multiple mailboxes (IMAP users can create and move messages between folders on
    the server), and portable mailbox access (IMAP users may move between different
    computers and have full access to their mail; POP users are restricted to the
    machine where their email was downloaded).

    to MTAs employing the Maildir format; none existed at the time.
