    Ethernet cables from a central hub or switch to individual computers and other
    devices as you need them. But it's almost always better to spend some time planning
    your network before you start to install it. It's a lot easier to make changes
    to your design on paper rather than making adds, moves, and changes in physical
    space. This chapter offers advice and instructions for preparing a network plan.

    or video cable as your primary network distribution medium. Both of those methods
    can be practical in some situations, but a traditional Ethernet system, possibly
    with a supplementary Wi-Fi base station, is usually a better choice for a small
    business or household network, because the equipment is widely available, it's
    often inexpensive, and it's easy to install and maintain.

    or workspace where you want to install your network. The plan doesn't have to
    be exactly to scale, but it should be big enough to add notes within each room
    or cubicle, and it should show the relative positions of each room. [Figure 5-1](ch05.html#use_a_floor_plan_to_identify_locations
    "Figure 5-1. Use a floor plan to identify locations for network connection points.")
    shows a typical floor plan for a small one-story house. If it's convenient, use
    a copier or scanner to make several copies of the floor plan.

- en: Wi-Fi networks are usually slower than wired Ethernet unless all the nodes in
    the network are compatible with the latest 802.11n standards.

  zh: 除非网络中的所有节点都兼容最新的802.11n标准，否则Wi-Fi网络通常比有线以太网慢。
- en: Wi-Fi networks are less secure than wired networks. Unless you protect your
    network with a secure encryption method such as WPA, a dedicated intruder can
    connect to the Internet through your network without your permission and can also
    steal information from the other computers on the same network.

  zh: 与有线网络相比，Wi-Fi网络的安全性较低。除非您使用WPA等安全加密方法保护您的网络，否则未经您允许，专门的入侵者可以通过您的网络连接到互联网，并可以从同一网络上的其他电脑中窃取信息。
- en: Interference between your Wi-Fi network and your neighbors' networks and other
    wireless devices can reduce your network's data transfer speed.

  zh: 您的Wi-Fi网络与邻居的网络和其他无线设备之间的干扰可能会降低您的网络数据传输速度。
- en: In spite of those limitations, a Wi-Fi network is often an acceptable choice
    if you don't want to cut holes through your walls or spend time crawling through
    your attic or basement. And even if you install a wired network through part of
    your building, Wi-Fi could be the best way to reach one or two isolated locations
    such as a top-floor bedroom or a detached garage.

  zh: 尽管存在这些限制，但如果您不想在墙上打洞或花时间在阁楼或地下室里爬行，Wi-Fi网络通常是一个可接受的选择。即使您在建筑的一部分安装了有线网络，Wi-Fi也可能是到达一两个孤立位置（如顶层卧室或独立的车库）的最佳方式。
- en: For many families and small businesses, the best approach is to install both
    wired and wireless in the same network. This will allow you and your users to
    connect your desktop computers, printer, music server, and other devices that
    never physically move through wired Ethernet, and use Wi-Fi for laptop computers,
    Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephones, smartphones, and other portable
    devices.

  zh: 对于许多家庭和小型企业来说，最佳做法是在同一网络中安装有线和无线网络。这将允许您和您的用户通过有线以太网连接您的台式电脑、打印机、音乐服务器和其他永远不会物理移动的设备，并使用Wi-Fi连接笔记本电脑、互联网协议语音（VoIP）电话、智能手机和其他便携式设备。
- en: If you decide to include one or more Wi-Fi access points in your network, mark
    their tentative locations on your floor plan. In most cases, a single access point
    can exchange data with computers and other devices within about 300 feet (100
    meters), so the exact location is not critical. The best location is often either
    in the network control center, or on the floor or a table next to a computer in
    a fixed location. For detailed information about installing Wi-Fi access points
    and connecting Wi-Fi devices to your home or office network, see [Chapter 8](ch08.html
    "Chapter 8. WI-FI NETWORKS").

  zh: 如果您决定在网络中包含一个或多个Wi-Fi接入点，请在您的平面图上标记它们的临时位置。在大多数情况下，单个接入点可以与大约300英尺（100米）范围内的电脑和其他设备交换数据，因此确切的位置并不重要。最佳位置通常是网络控制中心，或者在一个固定位置的电脑旁边的地板或桌子上。有关安装Wi-Fi接入点和将Wi-Fi设备连接到您的家庭或办公网络的详细信息，请参阅[第8章](ch08.html
    "第8章。Wi-Fi网络")。

    the control center and string Ethernet cables to each room. The next chapter will
    tell you how to do that job.
