    Ethernet cables from a central hub or switch to individual computers and other
    devices as you need them. But it's almost always better to spend some time planning
    your network before you start to install it. It's a lot easier to make changes
    to your design on paper rather than making adds, moves, and changes in physical
    space. This chapter offers advice and instructions for preparing a network plan.

    or video cable as your primary network distribution medium. Both of those methods
    can be practical in some situations, but a traditional Ethernet system, possibly
    with a supplementary Wi-Fi base station, is usually a better choice for a small
    business or household network, because the equipment is widely available, it's
    often inexpensive, and it's easy to install and maintain.

    or workspace where you want to install your network. The plan doesn't have to
    be exactly to scale, but it should be big enough to add notes within each room
    or cubicle, and it should show the relative positions of each room. [Figure 5-1](ch05.html#use_a_floor_plan_to_identify_locations
    "Figure 5-1. Use a floor plan to identify locations for network connection points.")
    shows a typical floor plan for a small one-story house. If it's convenient, use
    a copier or scanner to make several copies of the floor plan.

    now, but remote control and monitoring through your home network is a real possibility
    in the future. In each bedroom, plan for an outlet near a desk or table where

    network control center (sometimes known as a *wiring closet*) include closets,
    utility rooms, and garages or basements. For a very small network (no more than
    five nodes), you could also consider placing the modem and router on a table next

    each cable runs "home" to a central hub or switch. The alternative, which is more
    practical for telephone and video wiring than for data networks, is *point-to-point*
    wiring that uses long cable runs that connect to each outlet through a splitter,

    cables through the rafters and joists; but if you have to run cables through finished
    walls and ceilings, you will probably have to hide cables inside walls and behind
    baseboards and patch some holes after the wires are in place. Either way, look
