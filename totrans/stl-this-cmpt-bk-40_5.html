However, real hackers can often use their computer skills and knowledge to take advantage of other people. When hackers want to use their computer skills to steal from other people, they usually engage in some form of identity theft. When hackers want to use their computer skills to bombard people with advertisements for legitimate (and not-so-legitimate) products, they use spam.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Whatever the motivation may be, the end result of identity theft and spam is the same: Someone is hacking your life without your consent.</p><div class="sect1" title="Understanding Identity Theft"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="understanding_identity_theft"/>Understanding Identity Theft</h1></div></div></div><p>Computers aren't required to conduct identity theft, but they do make it easier and more convenient. In simple terms, identity theft involves masquerading as someone else so they get stuck paying your bills. This can be as easy as a waiter copying down your credit card number when you pay your dinner bill and then using it to order expensive merchandise by mail or over the Internet.</p><p>On a more extreme level, identity theft could occur when someone uses your name, Social Security number, current address, and date of birth to access your bank accounts, take out loans, and even to commit crimes that will be traced back to you.</p><div class="sect2" title="How identity theft works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_identity_theft_works"/>How identity theft works</h2></div></div></div><p>Relatively few people know you personally, so most people you do business with or otherwise meet in the course of your daily life rely on unique information to identify you, such as your full name, date of birth, Social Security number, mother's maiden name, zip code, and credit card number.</p><p>For all intents and purposes, however, anyone who possesses this information can trick others into thinking that he or she is you. The identity thief needn't have the skills to physically mimic your behavior, appearance, or manner of speaking to assume your identity.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Minimizing the threat of identity theft"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="minimizing_the_threat_of_identity_theft"/>Minimizing the threat of identity theft</h2></div></div></div><p>Anyone can become a victim of identity theft. Just ask Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and Tiger Woods. But when identity thieves target ordinary people, it's almost always because they have the opportunity, not because they took the time to target you specifically.</p><p>Identity thieves usually get your personal information one of three ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Hacking into corporate computers that store your personal information, such as the databases kept by banks and credit card companies. Hackers can also target any large company that stores its employee records on a computer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Dumpster diving in your trash or the trash of a company where you work or do business.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0002" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Phishing and other social engineering tricks to get your personal data.</p></li></ul></div><p>If a hacker breaks into a bank's computer and steals your account numbers and Social Security number along with your mother's maiden name, there's not a thing you can do about it. Your personal information is only as secure as the computers it's stored on, so it's important to share such data only with trusted institutions. And then pray that they protect it as best they can.</p><p>Dumpster diving just means digging through someone's trash looking for something valuable. Identity thieves look for documents with personal information printed on them, such as unopened credit card offers that already have a name and address on them. The identity thief can then fill out the application and have a credit card sent to you. Next, unless you have a locking mailbox, he watches your mail until the new card arrives. At this point, the identity thief can start racking up charges on a credit card that you don't even know exists (but that has your name printed on it, as will the bills that start pouring in a month later). Military bases are popular places for identity thieves to work because these locations often give them access to mail for a large number of people, which they can then intercept even without being a postal employee.</p><p>Another objective of dumpster diving is finding useful items such as bank account numbers on deposit slips, credit card bills (with credit card numbers printed on them), or tax return information (which can include Social Security numbers).</p><p>To protect yourself against dumpster divers, shred anything that contains personal information, and destroy credit card applications to prevent someone from filling them out without your knowledge. For further protection, get a mailbox with a lock.</p><p>If you're truly paranoid, get a post office box and have all financial information, such as credit card and bank statements, sent there. Of course, you still have to trust the people sorting the mail at your post office.</p><p>Finally, identity thieves can get your personal information through phishing, either by sending you email or calling you on the phone and pretending to be a legitimate company. To reach as many potential victims as possible, identity thieves may send a bogus email to thousands of people at once (a more malicious form of spam) and wait for a certain percentage of the recipients to fall for the scam and enter their personal information on their website.</p><p>Another strategy of phishers is to call potential victims directly, typically targeting senior citizens. Phone call phishing takes more time and effort, but can still yield the desired personal information.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In rare cases, identity thieves may set up sidewalk polls and ask respondents to provide their name, address, and phone number in the process. Since people aren't giving away anything that can't be found in a telephone book, they often see nothing wrong with doing this. What they don't realize is that they've made the identity thief's job a lot easier. He can use this information to find that person's Social Security and credit card numbers later.</p><p>The key to minimizing your risk of becoming an identity theft victim is to give out your personal information only sparingly, shred any papers with information that someone could exploit or use to find additional information about you, and never respond to unsolicited phone calls or emails.</p><p>Also be careful when giving out information to "trusted" organizations like banks or businesses. While they may request sensitive information like Social Security numbers for "marketing" purposes, you can always refuse to give them this information if it isn't legally required. By restricting who has access to your personal data, you limit the chances that someone can steal your personal information from someone else.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Protecting your credit rating"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="protecting_your_credit_rating"/>Protecting your credit rating</h2></div></div></div><p>Despite taking every precaution, you could still fall victim to an identity thief. To help you monitor and protect your credit rating, start by getting a free copy of your credit report, which you can request once every 12 months in one of the following ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Call 877.322.8228 (toll free).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fill out an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

You can print this form from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ftc.gov/credit">www.ftc.gov/credit</a> website.</p></li></ul></div><p>Under federal law, you can also receive a free copy of your credit report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment. If this happens, you can request a free copy of your credit report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. Reviewing your credit report can help you determine whether an identity thief has ruined your credit rating.</p><p>If you want to buy a copy of your credit report, contact one of the following:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Equifax</strong></span><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0004" class="indexterm"/></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>800.685.1111; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.equifax.com">www.equifax.com</a></p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Experian</strong></span><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0005" class="indexterm"/></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>888.EXPERIAN (888.397.3742); <a class="ulink" href="http://www.experian.com">www.experian.com</a></p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>TransUnion</strong></span><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0006" class="indexterm"/></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>800.916.8800; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.transunion.com">www.transunion.com</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>To avoid receiving credit card offers in the mail (and having to shred them to protect yourself), you can have credit card companies stop sending you their applications in the first place.

Unlike newspaper or magazine advertisements that you can ignore without losing a moment's thought, spam just doesn't seem to leave you alone.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0013" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Spamming means sending unsolicited messages to multiple email accounts or Usenet newsgroups. Victims of spamming must then take time to delete the unwanted messages so they can make room in their inboxes for useful email. Spam can include anything from legitimate advertisements to scams and bogus messages from identity thieves trying to phish for personal information. One of the more common types of spam involves chain letters or other suspicious "business opportunities" like this one:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>$$$$$$$$ FAST CASH!!!! $$$$$$$$</p><p>Hello there, Read this it works! Fellow Debtor: This is going to sound like a con, but in fact IT WORKS! The person who is now #4 on the list was #5 when I got it, which was only a few days ago. Five dollars is a small investment in your future. Forget the lottery for a week, and give this a try. It can work for ALL of us. You can edit this list with a word processor or text editor and then convert it to a text file. Good Luck!!</p><p>Dear Friend,</p><p>My name is Dave Rhodes. In September 1988 my car was repossessed and the bill collectors were hounding me like you wouldn't believe. I was laid off and my unemployment checks had run out. The only escape I had from the pressure of failure was my computer and my modem. I longed to turn my avocation into my vocation.</p><p>This January 1989 my family and I went on a ten day cruise to the tropics. I bought a Lincoln Town Car for CASH in February 1989. I am currently building a home on the West Coast of Florida, with a private pool, boat slip, and a beautiful view of the bay from my breakfast room table and patio.</p><p>I will never have to work again. Today I am rich! I have earned over $400,000.00 (Four Hundred Thousand Dollars) to date and will become a millionaire within 4 or 5 months. Anyone can do the same. This money making program works perfectly every time, 100 percent of the time. I have NEVER failed to earn $50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted. Best of all you never have to leave home except to go to your mailbox or post office.</p><p>I realized that with the power of the computer I could expand and enhance this money making formula into the most unbelievable cash flow generator that has ever been created. I substituted the computer bulletin boards in place of the post office and electronically did by computer what others were doing 100 percent by mail. Now only a few letters are mailed manually. Most of the hard work is speedily downloaded to other bulletin boards throughout the world.</p><p>If you believe that someday you deserve that lucky break that you have waited for all your life, simply follow the easy instructions below. Your dreams will come true.</p></blockquote></div><p>To further entice people, many spam chain letters include headings such as "As seen on Oprah" to lend them credibility. No matter how they disguise themselves, however, chain letter spam just another form of pyramid scheme (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. The Internet Con Artists">Chapter 13</a>) in which a few people benefit at the expense of everyone else.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Why Companies Spam and How They Do It"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_companies_spam_and_how_they_do_it"/>Why Companies Spam and How They Do It</h1></div></div></div><p>Nobody likes to receive spam because it wastes time and clogs email inboxes, yet many companies continue to send it anyway because, unlike direct mail and other forms of advertising, spamming is essentially free. For the cost of a single Internet account, anyone can reach a worldwide audience potentially numbering in the millions. In the eyes of spammers, even if they upset 99 percent of the people on the Internet, having 1 percent buy their product makes it all worth the trouble.</p><p>When sending spam, there's no need to type multiple email messages either; just as bulk mailers never lick their stamps, bulk emailing software automates the process for spammers. Click a button and you, too, can scatter unwanted email messages across the Internet.</p><p>Spammers are often stereotyped as scammers and con artists, but many are legitimate businesses that see spam as a low-cost, low-risk method for reaching potential customers. Of course, they realize that most people don't like receiving spam so they substitute euphemisms like "bulk email marketing." So the next time hordes of unwanted messages clog your email account, relax. You're not receiving spam; you're receiving bulk email marketing messages. Now don't you feel better?</p><p>To learn more about spam from the spammer's point of view, visit the websites of companies that sell bulk emailing programs, such as ClickZ Network (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.clickz.com">www.clickz.com</a>), Internet Marketing Technologies (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.marketing-2000.net">www.marketing-2000.net</a>), Email Marketing Software (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.massmailsoftware.com">www.massmailsoftware.com</a>), MailWorkz (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mailworkz.com">www.mailworkz.com</a>), or MTI Software (<a class="ulink" href="http://desktopserver.com">http://desktopserver.com</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0015" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Collecting email addresses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="collecting_email_addresses"/>Collecting email addresses</h2></div></div></div><p>Spammers often flood Usenet newsgroups, where they can target their products to people with specific interests. For example, a spammer selling vitamin supplements will likely find a receptive audience in the misc.health.alternative newsgroup.</p><p>Of course, newsgroups represent only a fraction of potential customers on the Internet. Before spammers can flood the Internet with their messages, they need a list of email addresses. Although email lists can be bought, they are not always accurate or up to date. So spammers use email address extracting programs to build their own lists. These programs harvest addresses from three sources: newsgroups, websites, and database directories.</p><div class="sect3" title="Newsgroup extractors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="newsgroup_extractors"/>Newsgroup extractors</h3></div></div></div><p>When you post a message to a Usenet newsgroup, your message appears with your email address. Newsgroup extractors simply download messages stored in a Usenet newsgroup, strip away the text, and store the return email addresses, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s03.html#a_newsgroup_extractor_can_scan_newsgroup" title="Figure 18-1. A newsgroup extractor can scan newsgroup postings and retrieve a list of email addresses within seconds.">Figure 18-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_newsgroup_extractor_can_scan_newsgroup"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e12661"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676691.png.jpg" alt="A newsgroup extractor can scan newsgroup postings and retrieve a list of email addresses within seconds."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-1. A newsgroup extractor can scan newsgroup postings and retrieve a list of email addresses within seconds.</p></div><p>To prevent your email address from getting sucked up by a newsgroup extractor, use a phony address or an anonymous remailer when posting messages to a newsgroup. Although this will prevent other newsgroup users from contacting you directly, it also prevents spammers from flooding your account with garbage.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Because newsgroup extractors harvest thousands of email addresses at once, some people substitute the @ symbol in their address with the word <span class="emphasis"><em>AT</em></span>, such as swapping <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:joesmith@yahoo.com">joesmith@yahoo.com</a></span> with <a class="ulink" href="http://joesmithatyahoo.com">joesmithATyahoo.com</a>. Initially, email extractors wouldn't recognize the word <span class="emphasis"><em>AT</em></span> in the middle of an email address, but newer versions are smart enough to replace the word with the @ symbol, so even this technique is slowly losing its effectiveness.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Website extractors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="website_extractors"/>Website extractors</h3></div></div></div><p>Website extractors work just like newsgroup extractors except that they pull their email addresses from websites. When people create personal websites, they often provide a link where visitors can reach them. For a business website, they often list a number of company contacts, such as salespeople, technical support people, and even the CEO and president. Spammers prowl the Internet, with the guidance of search engines, to find web pages and pluck email addresses to store for future use.</p><p>To trick website extractors, many people replace characters in their email address with the ASCII code equivalents. So, rather than type the @ symbol, web page designers can substitute the ASCII code equivalent of the @ symbol, which is &amp;#64, as shown below.</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e12695"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000"&gt;
E-mail: joesmith&amp;#64yahoo.com
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>The website extractor will probably strip away the invalid joesmith&amp;#64yahoo.com, even though this email address appears correctly as <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:joesmith@yahoo.com">joesmith@yahoo.com</a></span> when viewed in a browser window.</p><p>Unfortunately, the latest email extractors can even snare email addresses masked by ASCII codes and convert them into valid ones, so many websites now display their email addresses as a graphic image. People will know how to type it in correctly but email extractors won't, which can stop them for now.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="SMTP server extractors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="smtp_server_extractors"/>SMTP server extractors</h3></div></div></div><p>An SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server is a computer that sends and receives email. An SMTP server extractor is a program that retrieves valid email addresses from an SMTP server, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s03.html#an_smtp_server_extractor_can_dig_out_val" title="Figure 18-2. An SMTP server extractor can dig out valid email addresses from any SMTP server.">Figure 18-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="an_smtp_server_extractor_can_dig_out_val"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e12714"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676693.png.jpg" alt="An SMTP server extractor can dig out valid email addresses from any SMTP server."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-2. An SMTP server extractor can dig out valid email addresses from any SMTP server.</p></div><p>This is how it works. First, the extractor makes up an email address and asks the SMTP server if it's valid. It repeats this process indefinitely with fabricated addresses until it stumbles across a valid one that it can store for future spamming. To snare as many valid email addresses as possible, SMTP extractors typically target the servers of Internet service providers (ISPs), which can have thousands of customer email addresses waiting to be discovered.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0019" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="P2P network harvesters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="p2p_network_harvesters"/>P2P network harvesters</h3></div></div></div><p>When people join a filesharing network to swap music, movies, or programs, they often type in their email address, which anyone else on that filesharing network can view. This is yet more fertile territory for spammers in search of email addresses. To protect yourself, never type your email address anyplace where others might be able to view it without your knowledge. To make matters worse, many people, when they configure a filesharing program, inadvertently share all the files on their computer, allowing spammers to peek inside and copy address books from their email program, such as Microsoft Outlook. With that information, the spammers can start spamming you and all the people you know.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Phishing for email addresses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="phishing_for_email_addresses"/>Phishing for email addresses</h3></div></div></div><p>Responding to pressure from people annoyed by telemarketers, the government created a Do Not Call list (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.donotcall.gov">www.donotcall.gov</a>) where people could register their phone numbers. Telemarketers then had to scrub their phone lists to remove any numbers stored on this Do Not Call list.</p><p>So back in 2004, one spammer mimicked the Federal Trade Commission's site with his own bogus Do Not Spam site. The idea was that you could type in your email address here and spammers would be barred from sending you email. Unfortunately, this site was actually run by a spammer in the first place, so anyone who registered there wound up getting <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> spam. The Federal Trade Commission quickly shut down that bogus website, but the spammer had already succeeded in harvesting a huge list of valid email addresses.</p><p>In 2005, another phisher used spam to send out a Trojan horse. Anyone foolish enough to run the attached file installed the Trojan horse, which sat quietly on the infected computer until it detected the user visiting an online banking website. Then the Trojan horse would wake up, capture all keystrokes to snare passwords and account numbers, and then send this information back to the hacker, who could then access the victim's account as his leisure.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Masking the spammer's identity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="masking_the_spammer_apostrophy_s_identit"/>Masking the spammer's identity</h2></div></div></div><p>Spammers may incur the wrath of several hundred (or several million) irate victims. Some spam recipients respond with angry messages; others launch their own email bomb attacks, sending multiple messages to the spammer's own address, clogging it and rendering it useless.</p><p>Unfortunately, crashing or clogging the spammer's ISP can also punish innocent customers who happen to use the same service provider. To avoid such counterattacks, many spammers create temporary Internet accounts (on services such as Hotmail or Juno), send their spam, and then cancel the account before anyone can attack them. Getting kicked off an ISP and opening new accounts is just part of the game bulk emailers play. If someone actually wants to buy the spammer's product, he can click a link in the spam message that will take him to the spammer's website.</p><p>Of course, for those spammers who can't be bothered to open and close email accounts, there's an easier way. Many bulk emailing programs simply omit or forge the sender's email address to avoid counterattacks.</p><p>Most ISPs limit the amount of email a single individual can send to avoid bandwidth hogs from impeding other customers' Internet access. If an ISP catches someone sending out an inordinate amount of email, it can cancel the account. So, spammers may sign up for bulk emailing accounts, which are special mail servers that allow anyone to send massive amounts of email—for a price, of course.</p><p>Another alternative is the less expensive (and less ethical) method of sending spam through "zombie" computers, which have been previously hijacked by a worm or Trojan horse (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Trojan Horses and Worms">Chapter 5</a>).</p><p>After infecting a network of computers with worms or Trojan horses, the hacker can control the infected or zombie computers with a program, called a bot, which may be stored on an IRC chat room. The hacker then rents out his network of infected computers to spammers, who send their spam to the controlling bot, which in turn distributes it through the zombie network. This has several advantages over other spamming methods for the unscrupulous bulk emailer.</p><p>First, since the spam appears to be coming from the email account of each individual zombie computer, or through each infected computer's ISP's mail server, tracing the spam to its source leads to an innocent person, not to the spammer himself. Second, by sending spam through a network controlled by a bot, known as a botnet, the spammer isn't directly violating his ISP's ban on bulk mailing. Third, and most importantly, many spam filters work by blocking messages from known bulk email accounts. When the spam comes from computers connected through different ISPs such as Earthlink, spam can often circumvent any filters people have installed. (If a filter detects massive amounts of email coming from a single ISP, the spam filter will block it.

<div class="sect1" title="How Spam Filters Work"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_spam_filters_work"/>How Spam Filters Work</h1></div></div></div><p>Spam filters can reduce, but not eliminate, spam. Many ISPs now run spam filters to weed out the most obvious offenders, but you may still want your own filter to catch any additional spam that slips through. Common techniques that spam filters use include content filtering (also called Bayesian filtering), blacklists and whitelists, DNS lookups, and attachment filtering.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0028" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Content (Bayesian) filtering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="content_open_parenthesis_bayesian_close"/>Content (Bayesian) filtering</h2></div></div></div><p>Content filtering is the most common type of spam filtering. It works by analyzing the text in each message using probability theory developed by the mathematician Thomas Bayes. Most spam can be readily identified by subject and text headings like "!!!MAKE MONEY FAST!!!" However, other types of spam can be more subtle.</p><p>If you identify any spam messages that slip past the filter, the program can gradually "learn" and get better at sifting through similar spam in the future, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s05.html#you_can_configure_a_bayesian_filter_to_q" title="Figure 18-5. You can configure a Bayesian filter to &quot;learn&quot; how to recognize spam.">Figure 18-5</a>. Because spammers constantly change their tactics, you're always going to get some spam, but content filtering can gradually reduce a potential flood to a mere trickle.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Blacklists and whitelists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="blacklists_and_whitelists"/>Blacklists and whitelists</h2></div></div></div><p>Another filtering technique involves blacklists or whitelists, or both. A blacklist is simply a list of known spammer email addresses or domains, including domains of entire countries (because many spammers route spam through mail servers located in Russia or Romania), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s05.html#blacklists_and_whitelists_define_banned" title="Figure 18-6. Blacklists and whitelists define banned and approved email addresses.">Figure 18-6</a>. The moment the filter recognizes that a message has come in from a known spammer, it blocks the message.</p><div class="figure"><a id="you_can_configure_a_bayesian_filter_to_q"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e13019"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676699.png.jpg" alt="You can configure a Bayesian filter to &quot;learn&quot; how to recognize spam."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-5. You can configure a Bayesian filter to "learn" how to recognize spam.</p></div><p>Blacklists can supplement content filtering, but are easily fooled by themselves because spammers change email addresses so often. As a result, some filters also use whitelists.</p><div class="figure"><a id="blacklists_and_whitelists_define_banned"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e13029"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676701.png.jpg" alt="Blacklists and whitelists define banned and approved email addresses."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-6. Blacklists and whitelists define banned and approved email addresses.</p></div><p>A whitelist defines acceptable email addresses. If the filter receives email from anyone on its whitelist, the email may pass freely. All others will be rejected. In many cases, the filter will respond to any rejected email address, requesting that the user resend the message to a specific address or using a specific code. Any person sending legitimate email will have no trouble with this, but a spammer isn't likely to take the time to read and follow these additional instructions.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0032" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="DNS lookup lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dns_lookup_lists"/>DNS lookup lists</h2></div></div></div><p>Several organizations, such as SpamCop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.spamcop.net">www.spamcop.net</a>) and ORDB (Open Relay DataBase)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ordb.org">www.ordb.org</a>, maintain lists of known spam sources. To get their information, the maintainers of these lists deliberately solicit spam for analysis. To supplement its list of known spam sources, SpamCop creates lists of bogus email addresses that nobody uses, which they post on web pages. When spammers harvest these bogus email addresses and try to use them, SpamCop immediately recognizes them as spam.</p><p>Many mail servers on the Internet don't accurately record where email comes from, either through negligence or deliberate intent (such as special bulk mailing services). These types of mail servers are known as Open Relays, and because spammers tend to use these to mask their own email addresses, DNS lookup lists record known open relay servers and either reject any messages sent from them outright or scrutinize messages from these servers extra carefully to weed out spam, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s05.html#you_can_tell_your_spam_filter_to_reject" title="Figure 18-7. You can tell your spam filter to reject all email from known spam mail servers.">Figure 18-7</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-18-0034" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="you_can_tell_your_spam_filter_to_reject"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e13072"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676703.png.jpg" alt="You can tell your spam filter to reject all email from known spam mail servers."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-7. You can tell your spam filter to reject all email from known spam mail servers.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Attachment filtering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="attachment_filtering"/>Attachment filtering</h2></div></div></div><p>Many spammers send their entire message as a graphic image that can't be read by content filters. In response, some spam filters include attachment filters that look for email messages containing nothing but graphic images. Of course, these attachment filters can't identify the visual content of a graphic image, but, when combined with other filtering techniques, they can flag suspicious messages.</p><p>Attachment filtering can also help prevent infection by screening out .exe (executable), .wsh (Windows Script Host), or .vbs (Visual Basic Script) files that could contain viruses, worms, or Trojan horses.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Stopping Spam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="stopping_spam"/>Stopping Spam</h1></div></div></div><p>You can never completely stop spam, but you can eliminate much of it. First, find out whether your ISP offers a spam filter, and if so, then turn it on. If your ISP's spam filters don't seem terribly effective, consider switching your email account to a special filtering service such as SpamCop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.spamcop.net">www.spamcop.net</a>) or Aristotle Internet Access (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.aristotle.net/business-services/email-filtering">www.aristotle.net/business-services/email-filtering</a>). These services screen your email for spam and route suspicious messages to a designated location where you can review them before downloading.</p><p>For a second layer of defense, turn on filtering in your email client program, such as Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s06.html#most_email_programs_can_automatically_ro" title="Figure 18-8. Most email programs can automatically route suspicious email into a junk folder.">Figure 18-8</a>.

Create a separate account with a free service such as Hotmail to use for posting messages in Usenet newsgroups, registering at websites, or making online purchases (many companies sell your email address when you sign up with them). By creating a decoy email account, you can redirect spam to accounts that you rarely use and keep your everyday email account free of the most annoying spam.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0038" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When using multiple spam filters, make sure you always have a way to retrieve any messages that the spam filters weed out since there's always a chance that a legitimate message might get caught in a spam filter by mistake.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Possible future solutions to spam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="possible_future_solutions_to_spam"/>Possible future solutions to spam</h1></div></div></div><p>Many people are engaged in developing ways to stop spam entirely. One idea proposed by Bill Gates is to force everyone to buy "postage" to send email. This postage wouldn't cost money in the traditional sense. Instead, it would require the sending computer to calculate a mathematical problem, temporarily tying up its resources. It would cost the sending computer a trivial amount of time and resources for regular emailing, but it could cripple the spammer who wants to send 10,000 email messages at once.</p><p>Some Internet service providers are proposing to stamp outgoing messages with a digital signature of the customer's domain name, using strong encryption so no one could alter or forge it. One of the first implementations of this idea has come from Yahoo! (<a class="ulink" href="http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys">http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys</a>) and its open-source program DomainKeys, which verifies the domain of email senders. If someone tries to forge an email address, DomainKeys will automatically flag the message as spam.</p><p>Forcing computers to pay "postage" or reveal their true email address through encryption might work, but only if the entire structure of the Internet changes to adapt these practices en masse. Until then, spammers will continue flooding the Internet with advertisements while everyone tries to agree on a solution.</p><p>Microsoft is currently testing a unique email filter called SNARF (Social Network and Relationship Finder). SNARF doesn't analyze content. It works by analyzing to whom you send email and from whom you receive it. The idea is that you're more likely to want email from people you've contacted before, and that email from unknown addresses is more likely to be spam. To grab a copy of SNARF, visit Microsoft Research (<a class="ulink" href="http://research.microsoft.com/community/snarf">http://research.microsoft.com/community/snarf</a>).</p><div class="sect2" title="Going on the offensive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="going_on_the_offensive"/>Going on the offensive</h2></div></div></div><p>Filtering will never stop spam, so some people prefer to go on the offensive and attack spammers directly. In 2004, Lycos Europe distributed a special screensaver called Make Love Not Spam, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch18s07.html#the_make_love_not_spam_screensaver_would" title="Figure 18-9. The Make Love Not Spam screensaver would launch an email bombing attack against sites known to advertise through spam.">Figure 18-9</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_make_love_not_spam_screensaver_would"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e13164"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676707.png.jpg" alt="The Make Love Not Spam screensaver would launch an email bombing attack against sites known to advertise through spam."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 18-9. The Make Love Not Spam screensaver would launch an email bombing attack against sites known to advertise through spam.</p></div><p>When a computer was idle, the Make Love Not Spam screensaver would kick in and request to view a known spammer's website. If enough screensavers sent their requests at the same time, the spam website would become slow and overloaded, either making it inconvenient for legitimate users to purchase the spammer's products or denying them access altogether.<a id="IDX-CHP-18-0039" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Shortly after the Make Love Not Spam screensaver appeared, however, Lycos Europe killed the project. Public outcry over a commercial organization using a denial of service attack created too much controversy. Still, it shows that corporations are not above using hacker techniques and that the real future of hacking might lie within the payroll of a corporation.</p><p>IBM has developed a similar tactic for its FairUCE (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/fairuce">www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/fairuce</a>) spam filter. Unlike traditional filters that examine a message's content to identify spam, FairUCE analyzes email to determine where the message might have been sent from, despite forged email addresses and spoofed headers that mask its true source. Instead of trying to identify the spammer's email address, FairUCE tries to identify the domain that sent the spam in the first place. Then, it bounces the spam back to the sending domain in an attempt to slow it down and prevent it from sending more spam.</p><p>Another tool in the fight against spam, the OptOutByDomain (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.optoutbydomain.com">www.OptOutByDomain.com</a>) site, lets you tell spammers which domains you don't want them to spam, rather than listing one email address at a time.

Unethical advertising uses falsehoods to deceive the public; ethical advertising uses truth to deceive the public.</p><div class="attribution"><span>—<span class="attribution">
<span class="author"><span class="firstname">VILHJALMUR</span> <span class="surname">STEFANSSON</span></span>
</span></span></div></div><p>Nothing is really free. When you listen to the radio or watch TV, advertising covers the expenses and pays for the sponsors' right to broadcast their messages during your viewing time. Most people tolerate radio and television advertising and have grown accustomed to its constant interruptions.</p><p>However, in the world of the Internet, people don't have so much patience for advertising. While advertisements underwrite many websites and hosting services, there's a fine line between product promotion and invasion of privacy. Ideally, an Internet ad would pop up once and give you the option of making it go away. Instead, not only do online ads pop up (and keep popping up repeatedly), but they may also track which web pages you visit. That would be like having a TV that could peek into your living room to see which brand of potato chips you're eating and then could target you for commercials for a competitor's chips.</p><p>To attract your attention, Internet advertisers use a variety of formats, including banner ads and pop-up/pop-under ads. Any of these ads, however, can be an opportunity for abuse.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Banner Ads and Click Fraud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="banner_ads_and_click_fraud"/>Banner Ads and Click Fraud</h1></div></div></div><p>The simplest online ads are banner ads, which can appear in different places on a web page and typically display some sort of animation to catch your attention. Clicking on the banner ad will take you to the advertiser's website. <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#can_you_spot_all_the_banner_ads_on_this" title="Figure 19-1. Can you spot all the banner ads on this web page?">Figure 19-1</a> shows a web page with three different banner ads.</p><p>Advertisers place their banner ad on a web page and then pay a fee to the website operator each time someone clicks on it, an arrangement known as <span class="emphasis"><em>pay-per-click (PPC)</em></span>. For greater flexibility, many website operators partner with Google (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.google.com/ads">www.google.com/ads</a>), Yahoo!, and other search engines to provide different advertisements targeted to their specific audience. Every time someone clicks on an ad, the advertiser pays both the website operator and the search engine. Each click can cost the advertiser anywhere from a nickel to $50.</p><p>Theoretically, the more times a banner ad gets clicked, the more effective it is at reaching potential customers. The problem for the advertiser is that the pay-per-click method can only confirm that someone clicked on the ad, not whether he or she is really interested in the ad. Even worse, the advertiser has to pay the website operator (and any search engine partner) for every click, regardless of the outcome.</p><div class="figure"><a id="can_you_spot_all_the_banner_ads_on_this"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e13333"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676711.png.jpg" alt="Can you spot all the banner ads on this web page?"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 19-1. Can you spot all the banner ads on this web page?</p></div><p>This loophole has attracted dishonest website operators interested in making easy money at the advertisers' expense. One such company, called Auctions Expert International LLC, launched a website and signed up with Google AdWords in 2003. According to a lawsuit filed by Google, Auctions Expert hired approximately 50 people to sit at computers and click ads, artificially inflating the click-through rate and driving up the bills sent to advertisers. By engaging in such click fraud, Google's lawsuit claims, Auction Experts International generated $50,000 in revenue for itself, which Google then had to refund to the scammed advertisers.</p><p>An article in the May 3, 2004, edition of <span class="emphasis"><em>The Times of India</em></span> reported that click fraud is even driving one of the fast-growing areas for outsourcing. According to the newspaper, many companies are hiring Indian housewives, urban professionals, and college students to sit around and click ads, earning 18 to 25 cents per click, which can add up to $200 a month.</p><p>Rather than hire hordes of people to click banner ads, some website operators run automated programs known as <span class="emphasis"><em>autoclick software</em></span>. According to a US Department of Justice press release, in March 2005, the Secret Service arrested Michael Anthony Bradley, a 32-year-old programmer from California, who threatened to release an automated clicking program dubbed Google Clique, unless Google paid him $100,000 (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/html/2004_03_19_bradley.html">www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/html/2004_03_19_bradley.html</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you look to buy autoclick software, however, you'll find it's marketed as a tool to test your website to see how many users it can support, not as something to artificially boost your site's click rate. Some popular autoclick programs include Internet Macros (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.iopus.com">www.iopus.com</a>) and CT AutoClick (<a class="ulink" href="http://camtech2000.net">http://camtech2000.net</a>).

The most powerful and sophisticated software of its kind, FakeZilla is not only a "fake" or "virtual" hit generator, but in conjunction with your web and marketing resources it can improve your site profits.</p></blockquote></div><p>One way advertisers can spot bogus traffic is by identifying the IP address of each click and how long that IP address remains on the website. If 1,000 clicks come from the same IP address, which only stays at the advertiser's website for two seconds at a time, chances are good that those clicks were faked. That's why FakeZilla boasts that it can route your clicks through "a massive list of anonymous proxy servers."</p><p>There's even a plug-in for the Mozilla Firefox browser called SwitchProxy (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.roundtwo.com/product/switchproxy">www.roundtwo.com/product/switchproxy</a>), which lets you switch rapidly to different proxy servers so that each activity you perform on the Internet will appear to come from a different IP address.</p><p>Besides worrying about unscrupulous website operators, advertisers also have to worry about unscrupulous competitors. Some companies will hire people to click their competitor's ads on different websites or run autoclick software, forcing their rivals to waste money on phony clicks.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To prevent click fraud, many advertisers would like to change the current "pay-per-click" model to a "cost-per-action" arrangement, meaning they'd only pay for clicks that turn into actual sales.</p><p>Until websites can verify the legitimacy of all clicks, advertisers can try enlisting one of the various click auditing services.

Advertisers designed pop-up ads to get right in your face. Since a pop-up ad opens a new window that covers the web page you really want to see, you can't ignore it. This is like having an advertiser rush into your house, grab your head, and shove your face in front of the TV when a commercial plays.</p><p>Many websites, especially those offering pornography, pirated music and software, or hacker tools, may bombard you with multiple pop-up ads, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch19s02.html#pop-up_ads_force_you_to_look_at_them_whe" title="Figure 19-4. Pop-up ads force you to look at them whether you want to or not.">Figure 19-4</a>. Sometimes, if you shut down one pop-up ad, three more appear in its place, so that the only way you can disable all the pop-up ads is to shut down your browser completely. If you don't shut down all these pop-up ads, they can often flood your browser and freeze or crash your computer.</p><p>Pop-under ads are a bit more subtle. They also appear in little windows all over your screen, but they hide under—not on top of—your currently displayed web page. The moment you close your browser, those pop-under ads seem to appear magically, cluttering up your screen, and you probably won't have any idea which website opened them. Since pop-under ads don't intrude upon your browsing activities, advertisers believe they're more effective than pop-ups, which people swat away like pesky mosquitoes every time one appears.</p><div class="figure"><a id="pop-up_ads_force_you_to_look_at_them_whe"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e13439"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676717.png.jpg" alt="Pop-up ads force you to look at them whether you want to or not."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 19-4. Pop-up ads force you to look at them whether you want to or not.</p></div><p>Either way, the intrusive nature of both pop-up and pop-under ads can annoy people who might have been customers otherwise.</p><div class="sect2" title="How to create a pop-up/pop-under ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_to_create_a_pop-up_solidus_pop-under"/>How to create a pop-up/pop-under ad</h2></div></div></div><p>Advertisers create pop-up and pop-under ads using JavaScript, Dynamic HyperText Markup Language (DHTML), or Flash.

Since the Internet spans the world, it's very difficult to track how many people look at a particular ad and who they are. To meet these two needs, advertisers created a special tracking device called a <span class="emphasis"><em>web bug</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Tracking the websites you visit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="tracking_the_websites_you_visit"/>Tracking the websites you visit</h2></div></div></div><p>When you visit a website, your browser asks it to send all the text and graphic images contained on that page. Thus, a webserver needs to know the IP address of the visitor's computer in order to send the reply to his or her browser.</p><p>When a webserver sends a web page to your browser, it is encoded as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) instructions that tell your browser how to display and position text and graphics, the name of the different graphic files in the page, and other data about the page, such as the name of the server that sent it to your computer. In the following example of an HTML graphics statement, the graphic file is called dotclear.gif, its width and height are both one pixel, and the server that sent it is located at <a class="ulink" href="http://ad.doubleclick.net">http://ad.doubleclick.net</a> (it's this server that uses the web bug to retrieve information about your computer).</p><a id="I_programlisting2_d1e13575"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;IMG SRC=http://ad.doubleclick.net/dotclear.gif width=1" height="1"&gt;</pre><p>The example above is actually a web bug, so tiny in size that it's essentially invisible. When the server sends the web bug to a browser, the DoubleClick.net server can immediately identify the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The IP address of the computer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The specific web page that contains that web bug</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The time and date the web bug was retrieved<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-19-0012" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The type of browser in use</p></li></ul></div><p>Web bugs typically appear on web pages, but they can also appear inside banner ads, pop-up/pop-under ads, or HTML files send through email or posted in newsgroups. In their simplest usage, web bugs help advertisers determine how many people have visited a particular website and viewed a particular web page. On a more insidious level, web bugs can be used with browser cookies to track which websites a particular person visits and tailor advertisements specific to that individual's interests.</p><p>Cookies are small text files that contain unique information about you and your last visit to a specific website. For example, a cookie from Amazon.com can store a user ID to match your computer to its database that lists the last 20 items you browsed, along with any recent purchases.</p><p>Normally, cookies can only be used by the website that created and placed them on your computer. So a cookie placed on your computer by Amazon.com can't be read or used by any other websites, such as Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders bookstores.</p><p>Unfortunately, circumventing this restriction is what webservers like DoubleClick do when they place web bugs (and cookies) on your computer. Only DoubleClick's servers can read its own cookies, but since DoubleClick's web bugs appear on so many websites, they can effectively track what you do across multiple websites. Visit sites like Amazon.com, Best Buy, and CompUSA and DoubleClick's web bug/cookie combination can track what you've done on each site and thus create a more detailed profile of your browsing habits than any single website could do on its own. Armed with this information, DoubleClick can create unique customer profiles linked to specific IP addresses, essentially spying on your buying habits without your approval (or knowledge).</p><p>To learn more about what type of information web bugs can retrieve off your computer, visit the Analyze Your Internet Privacy site (<a class="ulink" href="http://network-tools.com/analyze">http://network-tools.com/analyze</a>) and Cookie Central (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using web bugs in spam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="using_web_bugs_in_spam"/>Using web bugs in spam</h2></div></div></div><p>The next time you receive spam, there's a good chance that it will contain HTML code (where a web bug can hide). The reason is simple. As soon as you view spam (such as in the Preview pane of an email program like Thunderbird or Outlook Express), your computer retrieves the text and graphic images defined by that HTML code. As soon as your computer requests the web bug, the web bug's server can identify not only your IP address and operating system, but also when you viewed the spam. This information can be particularly important because it tells the spammer that someone actually viewed the spam so the email address is valid (and can be sold to other spammers too).</p><p>Many email programs let you block graphics from being viewed, but you may want to test your email program by taking the web bug test at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nthelp.com/oetest/oe.htm">www.nthelp.com/OEtest/oe.htm</a>. This test will send you an email and after you open it in your email program, you can return to the website to see if the server managed to determine if you opened the "spam" or not.</p><p>Even if you're using a supposedly "secure" email program like Thunderbird, you may find yourself being victimized by web bug spam if you rely on the program's default settings. Thunderbird will only strip away HTML graphics or web bugs if it properly identifies the message as spam. Since Thunderbird won't identify the web bug test message from the <a class="ulink" href="http://nthelp.com">nthelp.com</a> site as spam, it will let the test message's web bug slip through, which also means that any spam that can slip past Thunderbird's spam filters will also be able to verify your email address, too. (In my limited testing with different email programs, both Outlook Express and Thunderbird failed to block the nthelp.com's test message, but Microsoft Entourage on Mac OS X did block the test message web bug.)<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0013" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If a recipient doesn't view the web bug in his email, it could mean that the email address isn't valid or that this particular person didn't bother to read it. In either case, the advertiser will likely remove that person's email address from its distribution list and avoid sending advertisements that will be ignored.</p><p>Some companies accused of planting web bugs in email marketing messages include Experian (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.experian.com">www.experian.com</a>), Digital Impact (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.digitalimpact.com">www.digitalimpact.com</a>), and Responsys (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.responsys.com">www.responsys.com</a>). By browsing their websites, you can get a better idea how email marketing firms work and how spam (better known by businesses by its euphemism of "email marketing") has now become a profitable and legitimate business model that includes clients such as Victoria's Secret, Microsoft, Marriott, and New York Life. Like it or not, spam, in one form or another, has become just another marketing strategy.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0014" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Bugging newsgroups"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bugging_newsgroups"/>Bugging newsgroups</h2></div></div></div><p>Newsgroups are another area where web bugs have started to appear. If you leave a message on a newsgroup as plain text, anybody can read the message anonymously. But if your newsgroup message contains HTML code, viewing that HTML newsgroup message causes the viewer's computer to request the HTML text and graphics from a server; this server must then identify the computer's IP address to send the requested HTML text and graphics.</p><p>By itself, HTML code can be harmless—except it allows a server to identify the IP address of the person reading the message and the time and date they read it. The extremely paranoid believe that HTML code (and web bugs) can identify people who subscribe to politically incorrect newsgroups, while others believe that governments might use web bugs to track down anyone trading child pornography or illegal MP3 files. By reading HTML code in newsgroup messages, you are no longer anonymous in a newsgroup, which is one major advantage of newsgroups in the first place.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Protecting yourself against web bugs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="protecting_yourself_against_web_bugs"/>Protecting yourself against web bugs</h2></div></div></div><p>Since web bugs often work with cookies to track your browsing habits, your first line of defense is to make sure your browser refuses all cookies.

<div class="sect1" title="Spamdexing: Search Engine Spamming"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="spamdexing_colon_search_engine_spamming"/>Spamdexing: Search Engine Spamming</h1></div></div></div><p>When most people use a search engine like Google or Yahoo!, they often click the first results listed at the top of the page. For example, type <span class="strong"><strong>Apple</strong></span> in a search engine like Google and the top result will be for the Apple Computer website. Two pages of search results later, you'll find a travel agency called Apple Vacations. Google, like most search engines, assumes that more people are likely to want to visit Apple Computer than Apple Vacations and ranks its results accordingly. Companies actually vie with one another to be at the top of the results returned by search engines.</p><p>To determine which companies appear as the top results, search engines use algorithms to estimate which sites are most relevant to any given search term. Companies can also pay to get their websites ranked higher up in the results by using Yahoo!'s sponsored search marketing (<a class="ulink" href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com</a>), Google's AdWords (https://adwords.google.com/select), or MSN's Keywords (<a class="ulink" href="http://advertising.msn.com.sg">http://advertising.msn.com.sg</a>).</p><p>Paying for additional exposure is nothing new or unethical. The problem comes when companies try to scam their way to the top of the search engine results. This is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>spamdexing</em></span> (spamming and indexing). Spamdexing involves the use of several techniques to fool search engine algorithms and improve search result rankings.</p><div class="sect2" title="Keyword stuffing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keyword_stuffing"/>Keyword stuffing</h2></div></div></div><p>The simplest way that search engines rank websites is by the number of times keywords appear on each page. A website that uses the word <span class="emphasis"><em>computer</em></span> multiple times on many pages is more likely to be relevant to someone searching for information about computers than a website that discusses computer-controlled sewage disposal and has only a single use of the word <span class="emphasis"><em>computer</em></span> on its pages.</p><p>So in its simplest form, <span class="emphasis"><em>keyword stuffing</em></span> simply fills a web page with the words that people are most likely to search for. For example, if you're in the pool cleaning business, you could fill your web page with words like <span class="emphasis"><em>pool</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>pool cleaning</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>pool chemistry</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>pool safety</em></span>. Of course, this could clutter up the appearance of your web page and ruin its readability. Instead, the keywords are hidden using tiny fonts in text that appears as the same color as the page background. In this way, the text isn't visible to ordinary users, but search engines still find multiple instances of the embedded keywords and will rank the website higher than a competitor's website with the same keywords mentioned only three or four times.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To limit the success of keyword stuffers, most search engines now analyze <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> the website uses keywords and not just how often.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Keyword content creators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keyword_content_creators"/>Keyword content creators</h2></div></div></div><p>Since search engines examine the content (text) of your web pages, another way to trick search engines is like keyword stuffing but involves copying text and rewriting it slightly so that it appears differently to the search engine. This tricks the search engine into thinking the website has twice as much relevant content as it really does. While you could rewrite a single chunk of text to make it appear as two or more different chunks, it's much easier to let the computer do it for you. Strike Saturday Inc. sells a program called ArticleBot (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.articlebot.com">www.articlebot.com</a>), shown in <a class="xref" href="ch19s04.html#a_content_creator_program_comma_like_art" title="Figure 19-9. A content creator program, like ArticleBot, can rewrite a single chunk of text to make it appear different and fool search engines.">Figure 19-9</a>, that can rewrite text automatically.</p><p>The more rewritten text you post on your website, the more keywords a search engine will find and the higher your website's ranking will be.

(To discourage people from crafting text solely to boost their rankings in a search engine, Google refuses to list Hot Nacho's website at all, essentially making the site invisible to anyone looking for it using Google. According to the owner of HotNacho.com, Google has punished him further by refusing to list any of his other websites, a dispute you can read about at <a class="ulink" href="http://hotnacho.com/wordpress-fracas">http://hotnacho.com/wordpress-fracas</a>.)<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0019" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Link farming"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="link_farming"/>Link farming</h2></div></div></div><p>Many search engines assume that if other websites link to a certain domain, that domain must be popular enough to merit a higher ranking. As a result, many websites artificially boost the number of sites linking back to them by creating bogus websites called <span class="emphasis"><em>link farms</em></span>, which contain nothing but links to the site whose rankings they want to improve.</p><p>Another trick is to post website links on the many blogs scattered all over the Internet, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>blog comment spamming</em></span>. As far as search engines are concerned, blogs are websites and links on blogs are as valid as any other.</p><p>To combat link farms and blog comment spamming, many search engines now rank links based on their source, so a link to your website from a major site, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cnn.com">www.cnn.com</a> or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a>, is weighted more heavily than a link from a blog or site on a free web hosting service like Geocities or AngelFire.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Cloaking and code swapping"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cloaking_and_code_swapping"/>Cloaking and code swapping</h2></div></div></div><p>When search engines examine websites, they scan the HTML code to analyze the content. However, some sites rely exclusively on displaying information through Flash animation. A search engine can detect a Flash movie on a website, but it can't determine its content, so Flash-heavy websites send a description to the search engine. Of course, nothing prevents a dishonest website operator from sending anything to the search engine in his quest for inflated search rankings. This is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>cloaking</em></span>. Search engines often threaten to ban websites that use cloaking.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-19-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Another technique is to create a temporary web page full of keywords and then, once it achieves a high ranking, to replace it with the original web page, a process known as <span class="emphasis"><em>code swapping</em></span>. Code swapping is harder to prevent because a dishonest website operator can claim that he legitimately updated the site after the search engine examined the original web page.<a id="IDX-CHP-19-0022" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Doorway pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="doorway_pages"/>Doorway pages</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes websites use an opening web page called a <span class="emphasis"><em>doorway</em></span> that displays animation or graphics before asking visitors to click a link to access the rest of the site. On legit-imate websites, doorway pages offer a fancy way to grab a viewer's attention. On pornographic websites, doorway pages often also contain keywords that people are likely to type when searching for something else. So when people search for something like <span class="emphasis"><em>warez</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>hacker tools</em></span>, the search engine lists the doorway page, and when people click the link in the search results, they find themselves on a porn site.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Spamdexing for hire"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="spamdexing_for_hire"/>Spamdexing for hire</h2></div></div></div><p>If these different spamdexing practices sound too complicated for you to learn, relax.

Somebody's paying to place their ads, someone else is getting paid to distribute those ads, and other people are getting paid to defraud the advertisers with fake clicks or phony search engine rankings (while still more people are getting paid to stop and catch the people defrauding the advertisers).</p><p>With all this going on, you should always keep in mind that search engines do nothing more than filter what you can and can't see on the Internet.

</span></span></div></div><p>In the early days of computers, people often wrote and released programs as shareware. Unlike commercial software that you have to buy before trying, shareware lets you take a test drive first. Some shareware programs were fully functional, while others had features crippled or omitted or incorporated a time delay that made the program stop working after a fixed length of time, such as 30 days. This was done intentionally to entice people to pay for the full version of the program.</p><p>If people didn't pay for the upgrade, the shareware programmer didn't make any money, which provided strong incentive for them to create useful programs that people would actually want to buy. However, as more people started connecting to the Internet, shareware programmers found another way to make money. They started selling space in their programs to display advertisements.</p><p>Dubbed <span class="emphasis"><em>adware</em></span>, these types of programs simply displayed a stream of banner ads in a part of the application window. Users could still use the program as they normally would, and the ads would change continuously, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20.html#eudora_is_advertiser-supported_semicolon" title="Figure 20-1. Eudora is advertiser-supported; it displays banner ads as you use the program.">Figure 20-1</a>. Under this arrangement, shareware programmers always got paid by an advertiser, so they could lower their shareware fees or even eliminate them altogether.</p><p>Most people tolerated adware since the ads were mostly unobtrusive and helped lower shareware prices. Microsoft has even toyed with the idea of giving away free copies of various programs, such as Microsoft Works and even Windows itself, by selling advertising space. Microsoft estimates that the revenue it could generate this way could potentially exceed what it earns in software sales.</p><p>However, if you uninstall an adware-supported program, you'll no longer see the ads, and so advertisers eventually developed spyware, a malicious version of adware. Unlike adware, which may be annoying but tolerable, spyware is considered to be completely despicable.</p><p>Like adware, spyware also displays ads on a user's screen, but typically as pop-up windows. Unlike adware, spyware can't be removed simply by uninstalling the program. In fact, spyware often can't be removed without intricate knowledge of how the operating system works. Spyware will keep bombarding the average user with a constant barrage of pop-up ads or peeking at what the user's doing (and possibly stealing their passwords) and there's nothing he can do to stop it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="eudora_is_advertiser-supported_semicolon"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e13945"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676729.png.jpg" alt="Eudora is advertiser-supported; it displays banner ads as you use the program."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-1. Eudora is advertiser-supported; it displays banner ads as you use the program.</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Most spyware is designed to infect computers running Microsoft Windows. If you're running a different operating system, such as Mac OS X or Linux, most spyware can't infect your computer. (Until, of course, someone eventually writes a spyware program for your operating system.)<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-20-0002" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Spyware Can Do"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_spyware_can_do"/>What Spyware Can Do</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike computer viruses and worms, spyware doesn't intentionally try to damage your computer; that happens as a byproduct of its activities. When spyware first burrows into your computer, it often clumsily alters critical parts of the system in its attempt to hide itself. When spyware runs, it often grabs resources, such as memory, from other programs, causing them to run slowly, act erratically, or even crash. As a result, a spyware-infected computer can run sluggishly or fail to work at all—and this is even before the spyware program has done anything other than bury itself in your computer.</p><p>Once spyware has infected your computer, it waits until you connect to the Internet before taking further action. If you never connect to the Internet, the spyware won't function, but it can still hog memory and crash your computer through its mere presence.</p><div class="sect2" title="Displaying pop-up ads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="displaying_pop-up_ads"/>Displaying pop-up ads</h2></div></div></div><p>The most common function of spyware is to display pop-up ads. As soon as you connect to the Internet, the spyware program contacts a server, which feeds it a constant stream of pop-up ads.</p><p>By themselves, these ads are merely annoying. Since advertisers want to target their ads to the type of people most likely to buy their products, however, most spyware will also monitor or spy on the user's activities to determine which web pages he has visited. The spyware then displays mortgage advertisements if the user has visited home financing websites, or Viagra advertisements if the user has visited pornographic sites.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Some spyware can get trickier, popping up an ad for a company when you visit the website of one of its competitors. So, when you go to Dell Computer's site, a pop-up ad for Gateway Computers might appear. If you have multiple spyware programs infecting your computer, or one that's particularly aggressive, it's posible that you'll be so inundated with pop-ups that you may have trouble getting any work done.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Home page hijacking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="home_page_hijacking"/>Home page hijacking</h2></div></div></div><p>To get advertisements in front of users another way, some spyware will hijack your browser's home page. Each time you launch the browser, the first thing you'll see will be the spyware website, which typically displays more banner ads. If you try to switch the setting of your browser's home page, the spyware program will prevent you from doing so.</p><p>Some sneaky spyware programs also monitor which websites you try to visit and then load an entirely different site instead, typically a competitor's site, but sometimes just random websites offering online gambling, mortgage refinancing, or Internet dating services. By replacing your home page or hijacking your browser completely, spyware can force you to look at ads whether you want to or not.</p><p>The craftiest spyware programs may let you visit any website you want, but the moment you go to a search engine, the spyware program hijacks the search engine results and displays its own list, which, naturally, consists of advertisers affiliated with the spyware manufacturer. Novice Internet users may not notice the difference and assume that the results they see were retrieved by the search engine, rather than being the work of a spyware program.</p><p>Spyware may also add to your browser long lists of bookmarked web pages that typically contain pornography. While most people will take the time to remove these unwanted bookmarks, a handful will always investigate the sites out of curiosity, especially since they may have innocent-sounding names. The moment you visit one of these planted bookmarks, you'll find yourself at a website which is likely to infect your computer with even more spyware.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stealing information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="stealing_information"/>Stealing information</h2></div></div></div><p>Since spyware can track which websites you've visited, some go one step further and transfer this information back to the spyware company. Armed with information from thousands of different users, the company can then analyze browsing habits and identify patterns to help it craft more targeted advertising. None of this is different from what marketing research companies do, except that when spyware retrieves this information, it's often done without the user's knowledge.</p><p>More malicious spyware, created by criminals, may even record your keystrokes to steal passwords, bank account numbers, and Social Security numbers. Less malicious, but equally devious, spyware may scan your hard disk to determine which programs you have installed, which other companies might be interested in knowing for market research purposes.</p><p>This kind of spyware most likely won't annoy you with pop-up ads because its <span class="emphasis"><em>raison d'être</em></span> is to steal sensitive information without your knowledge. The last thing it wants to do is alert you to its presence. But even if it's not bugging you with ads, it can still degrade the performance of your computer.</p></div></div></div>

Throw enough advertisements in front of enough people and, statistically, a certain percentage will always buy something in response. So, it's in the advertiser's best interests to flood the market with as many advertisements as possible. (Advertising.com estimates that pop-up ads are up to ten times more effective than banner ads, partially due to the "annoyance" factor of having them obscure the user's screen.)</p><p>The five main spyware culprits are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Any company that wants to advertise online.

These companies may be perfectly legitimate, but they aren't likely to run banner ads on mainstream websites due to the sensitive nature of their products or services. As a result, spyware might be considered the best and only way for them to reach a mass online audience.</p><p>Not only is spyware a major nuisance for innocent computer users, but it can also cause more serious headaches for advertisers through something known as affiliate fraud. Affiliate fraud takes advantage of the way that many websites accept advertising. Large websites, such as CNN and Yahoo!, can demand money up front to place ads, but smaller websites don't have that clout. Instead, small websites often post the ads and receive a referral fee later if someone clicks on that ad and buys something from that merchant. Agreements that allow websites to display ads and get paid by advertisers are called affiliate networks.</p><p>To learn more about how affiliate marketing programs work, you can visit ClixGalore (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.clixgalore.com">www.clixgalore.com</a>), Commission Junction (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cj.com">www.cj.com</a>), LinkShare (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.linkshare.com">www.linkshare.com</a>), Performics (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.performics.com">www.performics.com</a>), or TradeDoubler (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tradedoubler.com">www.tradedoubler.com</a>).</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch20s02.html#an_affiliate_marketing_program_lets_you" title="Figure 20-5. An affiliate marketing program lets you sign up to promote different advertisers.">Figure 20-5</a> lists some of the different advertisers you can promote through your website along with how much each pays. (The ClixGalore website keeps the most recent list. You may recognize some of these advertisers as the same ones appearing in spyware pop-up ads.)</p><p>If a website joins an advertiser's affiliate program, the website owner can display ads and get paid every time someone clicks on that ad.

They'll sign up as an affiliate with an advertising network and then create spyware to display advertisements. Once this spyware spreads, people will get bombarded with pop-up ads. If they click these pop-up ads, the credit (and cash) for each click goes to the affiliated website, without the user's ever having visited that affiliated website. If a company only advertises with banner and pop-up ads, there's a good chance that someone will write a program to display those ads through a spyware network without the company's knowledge.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Spyware companies can hurt legitimate affiliate websites too. Some spyware programs will wait until a visitor clicks on a banner ad before displaying a pop-up ad. When the user closes the pop-up, the spyware program tricks the merchant into thinking the visitor came from the spyware company's website (not the site with the banner ad). If the visitor buys anything, the merchant pays the commission to the spyware company instead of the honest website affiliate.</p></div>

Since nobody will load spyware intentionally, spyware often hides itself within other programs such as filesharing programs (Kazaa), browser add-ins (Xupiter), games (Bonzi Buddy), or utilities (PCFriendly). When you install a spyware-infected program, you'll often see a license agreement that informs you (in fine print) that the program is advertiser-sponsored, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20s03.html#an_installation_program_will_typically_w" title="Figure 20-6. An installation program will typically warn you that it's going to install advertiser-sponsored programs (which could actually be spyware) on your computer.">Figure 20-6</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="an_installation_program_will_typically_w"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e14140"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676739.png.jpg" alt="An installation program will typically warn you that it's going to install advertiser-sponsored programs (which could actually be spyware) on your computer."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-6. An installation program will typically warn you that it's going to install advertiser-sponsored programs (which could actually be spyware) on your computer.</p></div><p>The license agreement for installing the WhenU advertiser software even includes this disclaimer (which most people are likely to ignore):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>WhenU.com's Save! software shows you relevant coupon offers, contextual information and services as you surf the Web. Save! attempts to display offers at the moment when they are most relevant to you. Offers and information are displayed in the form of interstitials ("pop-up ads") and various other ad formats.</p><p>The Save! software selects which ads and offers to display to individual users based on several factors, including: which Web pages you visit, search terms you use while searching online, content of the Web pages you view and your local zip code (if you have supplied it). Use of Save! is required to continue using these applications for free. As a result, Save! cannot be uninstalled from your computer's Control Panel independently. In order to completely remove Save! from your computer, you must uninstall all of the Save!-supported software from your computer. Once you do so, your Save! software will automatically be uninstalled as well.</p></blockquote></div><p>By reading the above disclaimer, you learn that the WhenU software will display ads and monitor your Internet browsing activities. In some cases, viewing ads might seem like a fair trade-off to get useful software for free, but in many cases, the barrage of pop-up ads can be more troublesome than it's worth.</p><p>Examine license agreements like this one carefully. Some advertiser-supported programs are harmless, but many more are spyware. If you avoid any type of advertiser-supported program, you'll reduce the threat of being infected by spyware immensely.</p><p>Since End User License Agreements (EULAs) are often difficult to read and (purposely) confusing to understand, don't install any software until you run the text from its EULA through a free program called EULAlyzer (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/eulalyzer.html">www.javacoolsoftware.com/eulalyzer.html</a>), which analyzes EULAs for suspicious wording that could indicate the presence of spyware.

The moment you download and install one of these anti-spyware programs off the Internet, you actually install a (possibly bogus) anti-spyware program along with additional spyware.

As soon as the victim visits this website, it uses an ActiveX control to secretly install spyware.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>ActiveX controls are small, self-contained programs that programmers originally used as building blocks to create their own programs in languages like Visual Basic. When the Internet grew in popularity, Microsoft developed ActiveX to be an easy shortcut for making web pages interactive. A web designer can have a page display games, stock market graphs, or animation without doing anything more complicated than adding an ActiveX control that somebody else has already written.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>But ActiveX controls can do more than just display information. Many antivirus vendors, such as Trend Micro and McAfee, use ActiveX controls to scan your computer for viruses and other threats. Microsoft even uses ActiveX controls to determine which updates you might need for Windows or Microsoft Office.</p><p>Since ActiveX controls are really just miniature programs, they have the ability to copy files on to your computer. Legitimate ActiveX controls, such as online virus scanners, will ask for your permission before copying anything, but malicious ones may trick you by displaying a dialog box that asks if you'd like a free gift or software. Clicking the Yes button gives the website permission to run the ActiveX control to download spyware.</p><p>Sometimes an ActiveX control won't even bother asking for your permission. If you use Internet Explorer to visit a web page with a malicious ActiveX control embedded in it, the ActiveX control will just go ahead and load the spyware without any further ado. (Other browsers, such as Firefox or Opera, protect you from drive-by downloading of spyware by not running ActiveX controls.)</p><p>Once the spyware programs are installed, you'll suddenly start seeing pop-up ads and you may have no idea where the spyware even came from.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Spyware-infected spyware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="spyware-infected_spyware"/>Spyware-infected spyware</h2></div></div></div><p>What makes computer viruses particularly dangerous is their ability to replicate themselves. Fortunately, spyware can't copy itself (yet), but once it infects a computer, it's vulnerable to removal by an anti-spyware program. So the latest spyware tactic is to use spyware to constantly download more spyware from the Internet, in addition to retrieving pop-up advertisements. Such spyware-infested spyware programs keep adding more and more junk to your computer until either you remove it (good luck) or your computer crashes under its collective weight.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Where Spyware Hides"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_spyware_hides"/>Where Spyware Hides</h1></div></div></div><p>Well-behaved Windows application programs install themselves in a separate folder and store program setting information in a special system database known as the Windows registry. A well-behaved program runs only when the user loads it and stops when the user exits the program. To remove a well-behaved program, a user needs only to run the uninstall program that deletes the program folder and also deletes the information stored in the Windows registry.</p><p>Theoretically, that's how installing and uninstalling a program should work, but even well-behaved progams can leave files scattered around a hard disk, or chunks of information abandoned in the Windows registry, consuming disk space and making the registry larger and more cumbersome for your computer to use (which slows down its performance).</p><p>When spyware programs install themselves, they also bury information in the Windows registry and copy files onto the hard disk, but instead of doing this out in the open, spyware creates hidden files and folders. To view hidden files and folders in Windows Explorer, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Windows Explorer program.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Choose Tools ▸ Folder options.

Spyware may take extra steps to hide itself in memory so that the Windows Task Manager program won't detect its presence.<a id="IDX-CHP-20-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>After burying itself in the Windows registry, spyware scatters its hidden files and folders in multiple places on your hard disk to make itself nearly impossible to find and remove. Some may also hide a dropper program, a tiny program meant to slip past a computer's defenses and hide on the hard disk. The moment the dropper program detects that you've removed the spyware program, it accesses the Internet again and puts all the spyware right back on your computer.</p></div>

Some popular commercial firewalls include Look 'n' Stop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.looknstop.com">www.looknstop.com</a>) and Norton Personal Firewall (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.symantec.com">www.symantec.com</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Monitoring your startup programs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="monitoring_your_startup_programs"/>Monitoring your startup programs</h2></div></div></div><p>One way to detect the presence of spyware is to monitor which programs your computer launches automatically when you boot up. Programs such as System Mechanic (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.iolo.com">www.iolo.com</a>), Process Guard (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.diamondcs.com.au">www.diamondcs.com.au</a>), MalWhere (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.malwhere.com">www.malwhere.com</a>), and Advanced Startup Manager (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.rayslab.com">www.rayslab.com</a>) display a list of startup programs, which you can use to study and then disable or delete any suspicious programs.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Spyware deliberately disguises itself under cryptic names, so unless you know what to look for, it's possible that you could accidentally disable or remove a legitimate program by mistake.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Running anti-spyware programs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="running_anti-spyware_programs"/>Running anti-spyware programs</h2></div></div></div><p>Spyware companies are always modifying their programs to slip past the defenses of anti-spyware programs and avoid detection and removal, so you can never rely on a single anti-spyware program to protect your computer completely.</p><p>Just as with viruses and antivirus software, one piece of spyware may slip past a handful of anti-spyware programs, but it won't get by all of them. For that reason, it's best to run at least two anti-spyware programs. The good news is that there are plenty of free anti-spyware programs to choose from, such as Spybot (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.safer-networking.org">www.safer-networking.org</a>), Ad-Aware (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com">www.lavasoftusa.com</a>), Bazooka (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kephyr.com">www.kephyr.com</a>), SpywareBlaster (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.javacoolsoftware.com">www.javacoolsoftware.com</a>), or Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a>). Although there currently isn't any spyware infecting the Mac OS X operating system, you may want to protect yourself with MacScan (<a class="ulink" href="http://macscan.securemac.com">http://macscan.securemac.com</a>) anyway.</p><p>You should also consider buying a commercial anti-spyware program. Commercial anti-spyware programs usually offer more features for preventing spyware infection and give you added assurance that your computer is spyware-free. Some popular commercial anti-spyware programs include Spy Sweeper (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.webroot.com">www.webroot.com</a>), PestPatrol (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pestpatrol.com">www.pestpatrol.com</a>), and McAfee AntiSpyware (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mcafee.com">www.mcafee.com</a>).</p><p>For additional help detecting and removing spyware, use the Trend Micro Anti-Spyware (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.trendmicro.com/spyware-scan">www.trendmicro.com/spyware-scan</a>) or Panda ActiveScan (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pandasoftware.com/products/activescan.htm">www.pandasoftware.com/products/activescan.htm</a>) online scanners. Both of these run an ActiveX control and require that you use Internet Explorer, but both Trend Micro and Panda Software are well-known companies that you can trust.</p><p>Then again, maybe not. Some spyware companies are now cutting deals with anti-spyware companies. For example, Aluria Software (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.aluriasoftware.com">www.aluriasoftware.com</a>), the makers of Aluria Anti-Spyware, made an agreement with the adware/spyware company WhenU, whereby Aluria agreed not to classify any of WhenU's programs as spyware. WhenU later sealed similar agreements with the makers of PestPatrol and Ad-Aware.</p><p>When Microsoft was rumored to be interested in purchasing the spyware company Claria (formerly known as Gator), the Microsoft Windows AntiSpyware tool still detected Claria's spyware programs but no longer recommended that users remove them. With spyware companies jumping in bed with anti-spyware companies, there's a good chance that your computer could be infected with spyware and your anti-spyware programs won't find it, not because of technical reasons, but because of business reasons, and you'll be the one left to suffer.</p></div></div></body></html>
