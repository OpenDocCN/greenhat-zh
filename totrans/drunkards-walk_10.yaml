    and the properties of any given situation or environment lead directly and unequivocally
    to precise consequences. That is an orderly world, one in which everything can
    be foreseen, computed, predicted. But for Laplace’s dream to hold true, several
    conditions must be met. First, the laws of nature must dictate a definite future,
    and we must know those laws. Second, we must have access to data that completely
    describe the system of interest, allowing no unforeseen influences. Finally, we
    must have sufficient intelligence or computing power to be able to decide what,
    given the data about the present, the laws say the future will hold. In this book
    we’ve examined many concepts that aid our understanding of random phenomena. Along
    the way we’ve gained insight into a variety of specific life situations. Yet there
    remains the big picture, the question of how much randomness contributes to where
    we are in life and how well we can predict where we are going.

    many scholars shared Laplace’s belief in determinism. They felt as Galton did
    that our path in life is strictly determined by our personal qualities, or like
    Quételet they believed that the future of society is predictable. Often they were
    inspired by the success of Newtonian physics and believed that human behavior
    could be foretold as reliably as other phenomena in nature. It seemed reasonable
    to them that the future events of the everyday world should be as rigidly determined
    by the present state of affairs as are the orbits of the planets.

    technology of his day—a primitive computer—to carry out Laplace’s program in the
    limited realm of the weather. That is, if Lorenz supplied his noisy machine with
    data on the atmospheric conditions of his idealized earth at some given time,

    of numbers representing the weather conditions at future times.

    employed as initial conditions data printed out in the earlier simulation. He
    expected the computer to regenerate the remainder of the previous simulation and
    then carry it further. But instead he noticed something strange: the weather had
    evolved differently. Rather than duplicating the end of the previous simulation,
    the new one diverged wildly. He soon recognized why: in the computer’s memory
    the data were stored to six decimal places, but in the printout they were quoted
    to only three. As a result, the data he had supplied were a tiny bit off. A number
    like 0.293416, for example, would have appeared simply as 0.293.'

- en: Scientists usually assume that if the initial conditions of a system are altered
    slightly, the evolution of that system, too, will be altered slightly. After all,
    the satellites that collect weather data can measure parameters to only two or
    three decimal places, and so they cannot even track a difference as tiny as that
    between 0.293416 and 0.293\. But Lorenz found that such small differences led
    to massive changes in the result.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts2a)
    The phenomenon was dubbed the butterfly effect, based on the implication that
    atmospheric changes so small they could have been caused by a butterfly flapping
    its wings can have a large effect on subsequent global weather patterns. That
    notion might sound absurd—the equivalent of the extra cup of coffee you sip one
    morning leading to profound changes in your life. But actually that does happen—for
    instance, if the extra time you spent caused you to cross paths with your future
    wife at the train station or to miss being hit by a car that sped through a red
    light. In fact, Lorenz’s story is itself an example of the butterfly effect, for
    if he hadn’t taken the minor decision to extend his calculation employing the
    shortcut, he would not have discovered the butterfly effect, a discovery which
    sparked a whole new field of mathematics. When we look back in detail on the major
    events of our lives, it is not uncommon to be able to identify such seemingly
    inconsequential random events that led to big changes.

- en: Determinism in human affairs fails to meet the requirements for predictability
    alluded to by Laplace for several reasons. First, as far as we know, society is
    not governed by definite and fundamental laws in the way physics is. Instead,
    people’s behavior is not only unpredictable, but as Kahneman and Tversky repeatedly
    showed, also often irrational (in the sense that we act against our best interests).
    Second, even if we could uncover the laws of human affairs, as Quételet attempted
    to do, it is impossible to precisely know or control the circumstances of life.
    That is, like Lorenz, we cannot obtain the precise data necessary for making predictions.
    And third, human affairs are so complex that it is doubtful we could carry out
    the necessary calculations even if we understood the laws and possessed the data.
    As a result, determinism is a poor model for the human experience. Or as the Nobel
    laureate Max Born wrote, “Chance is a more fundamental conception than causality.”[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts3a)

    The request was intercepted and sent to the Office of Naval Intelligence. It wended

    Pearl Harbor into five areas and to make reports on ships in the harbor with reference
    to those areas. Of special interest were battleships, destroyers, and aircraft
    carriers, as well as information regarding the anchoring of more than one ship
    at a single dock. Some weeks later another curious incident occurred: U.S. monitors
    lost track of radio communications from all known carriers in the first and second
    Japanese fleets, losing with it all knowledge of their whereabouts. Then in early
    December the Combat Intelligence Unit of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii
    reported that the Japanese had changed their call signs for the second time in
    a month. Call signs, such as WCBS or KNPR, are designations identifying the source
    of a radio transmission. In wartime they reveal the identity of a source not only
    to friend but also to foe, so they are periodically altered. The Japanese had
    a habit of changing them every six months or more. To change them twice in thirty
    days was considered a “step in preparing for active operations on a large scale.”
    The change made identification of the whereabouts of Japanese carriers and submarines
    in the ensuing days difficult, further confusing the issue of the radio silence.'

- en: In any complex string of events in which each event unfolds with some element
    of uncertainty, there is a fundamental asymmetry between past and future. This
    asymmetry has been the subject of scientific study ever since Boltzmann made his
    statistical analysis of the molecular processes responsible for the properties
    of fluids (see chapter 8). Imagine, for example, a dye molecule floating in a
    glass of water. The molecule will, like one of Brown’s granules, follow a drunkard’s
    walk. But even that aimless movement makes progress in some direction. If you
    wait three hours, for example, the molecule will typically have traveled about
    an inch from where it started. Suppose that at some point the molecule moves to
    a position of significance and so finally attracts our attention. As many did
    after Pearl Harbor, we might look for the reason why that unexpected event occurred.
    Now suppose we dig into the molecule’s past. Suppose, in fact, we trace the record
    of all its collisions. We will indeed discover how first this bump from a water
    molecule and then that one propelled the dye molecule on its zigzag path from
    there to here. In hindsight, in other words, we can clearly explain why the past
    of the dye molecule developed as it did. But the water contains many other water
    molecules that *could have* been the ones that interacted with the dye molecule.
    To predict the dye molecule’s path *beforehand* would have therefore required
    us to calculate the paths and mutual interactions of all those potentially important
    water molecules. That would have involved an almost unimaginable number of mathematical
    calculations, far greater in scope and difficulty than the list of collisions
    needed to understand the past. In other words, the movement of the dye molecule
    was virtually impossible to predict before the fact even though it was relatively
    easy to understand afterward.

    one-year, three-year, and five-year plans for its educational software division.
    There were high-paid consultants, lengthy marketing meetings, late-night financial-analysis
    sessions, long offsite afternoon powwows. In the end, hunches were turned into
    formulas claiming the precision of several decimal places, and wild guesses were
    codified as likely outcomes. When in the first year certain products didn’t sell
    as well as expected or others sold better than projected, reasons were found and
    the appropriate employees blamed or credited as if the initial expectations had
    been meaningful. The next year saw a series of unforeseen price wars started by
    two competitors. The year after that the market for educational software collapsed.
    As the uncertainty compounded, the three-year plan never had a chance to succeed.
    And the five-year plan, polished and precise as a diamond, was spared any comparison
    with performance, for by then virtually everyone in the division had moved on
    to greener pastures.

    of the idea that events unfold in a manner that can be predicted. In fact, in
    the study of history the illusion of inevitability has such serious consequences
    that it is one of the few things that both conservative and socialist historians
    can agree on. The socialist historian Richard Henry Tawney, for example, put it

    they have swallowed up.”[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts5a) And
    the historian Roberta Wohlstetter, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom

    always crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling…. But before

- en: In some sense this idea is encapsulated in the cliché that hindsight is always
    20/20, but people often behave as if the adage weren’t true. In government, for
    example, a should-have-known-it blame game is played after every tragedy. In the
    case of Pearl Harbor (and the September 11 attacks) the events leading up to the
    attack, when we look back at them, certainly seem to point in an obvious direction.
    Yet as with the dye molecule, the weather, or the chess game, if you start well
    before the fact and trace events forward, the feeling of inevitability quickly
    dissolves. For one thing, in addition to the intelligence reports I quoted, there
    was a huge amount of useless intelligence, with each week bringing new reams of
    sometimes alarming or mysterious messages and transcripts that would later prove
    misleading or insignificant. And even if we focused on the reports that hindsight
    tells us were important, before the attack there existed for each of those reports
    a reasonable alternative explanation that did not point toward a surprise attack
    on Pearl Harbor. For example, the request to divide Pearl Harbor into five areas
    was similar in style to other requests that had gone to Japanese agents in Panama,
    Vancouver, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. The loss of radio contact was
    also not unheard of and had in the past often meant simply that the warships were
    in home waters and communicating via telegraphic landlines. Moreover, even if
    you believed a broadening of the war was impending, many signs pointed toward
    an attack elsewhere—in the Philippines, on the Thai peninsula, or on Guam, for
    example. There were not, to be sure, as many red herrings as water molecules encountered
    by a molecule of dye, but there were enough to obscure a clear vision of the future.

- en: After Pearl Harbor seven committees of the U.S. Congress delved into the process
    of discovering why the military had missed all the “signs” of a coming attack.
    Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, for one, drew heavy criticism for
    a May 1941 memo to President Roosevelt in which he wrote that “the Island of Oahu,
    due to its fortification, its garrison and its physical characteristic, is believed
    to be the strongest fortress in the world” and reassured the president that, in
    case of attack, enemy forces would be intercepted “within 200 miles of their objective…by
    all types of bombardment.” General Marshall was no fool, but neither did he have
    a crystal ball. The study of randomness tells us that the crystal ball view of
    events is possible, unfortunately, only after they happen. And so we believe we
    know why a film did well, a candidate won an election, a storm hit, a stock went
    down, a soccer team lost, a new product failed, or a disease took a turn for the
    worse, but such expertise is empty in the sense that it is of little use in predicting
    when a film will do well, a candidate will win an election, a storm will hit,
    a stock will go down, a soccer team will lose, a new product will fail, or a disease
    will take a turn for the worse.

- en: IN MARCH 1979 another famously unanticipated chain of events occurred, this
    one at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.[⁷](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts7a)
    It resulted in a partial meltdown of the core, in which the nuclear reaction occurs,
    threatening to release into the environment an alarming dose of radiation. The
    mishap began when a cup or so of water emerged through a leaky seal from a water
    filter called a polisher. The leaked water entered a pneumatic system that drives
    some of the plant’s instruments, tripping two valves. The tripped valves shut
    down the flow of cold water to the plant’s steam generator—the system responsible
    for removing the heat generated by the nuclear reaction in the core. An emergency
    water pump then came on, but a valve in each of its two pipes had been left in
    a closed position after maintenance two days earlier. The pumps therefore were
    pumping water uselessly toward a dead end. Moreover, a pressure-relief valve also
    failed, as did a gauge in the control room that ought to have shown that the valve
    was not working.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Viewed separately, each of the failures was of a type considered both commonplace
    and acceptable. Polisher problems were not unusual at the plant, nor were they
    normally very serious; with hundreds of valves regularly being opened or closed
    in a nuclear power plant, leaving some valves in the wrong position was not considered
    rare or alarming; and the pressure-relief valve was known to be somewhat unreliable
    and had failed at times without major consequences in at least eleven other power
    plants. Yet strung together, these failures make the plant seem as if it had been
    run by the Keystone Kops. And so after the incident at Three Mile Island came
    many investigations and much laying of blame, as well as a very different consequence.
    That string of events spurred Yale sociologist Charles Perrow to create a new
    theory of accidents, in which is codified the central argument of this chapter:
    in complex systems (among which I count our lives) we should expect that minor
    factors we can usually ignore will by chance sometimes cause major incidents.[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts8a)'

- en: In his theory Perrow recognized that modern systems are made up of thousands
    of parts, including fallible human decision makers, which interrelate in ways
    that are, like Laplace’s atoms, impossible to track and anticipate individually.
    Yet one can bet on the fact that just as atoms executing a drunkard’s walk will
    eventually get somewhere, so too will accidents eventually occur. Called normal
    accident theory, Perrow’s doctrine describes how that happens—how accidents can
    occur without clear causes, without those glaring errors and incompetent villains
    sought by corporate or government commissions. But although normal accident theory
    is a theory of why, inevitably, things sometimes go wrong, it could also be flipped
    around to explain why, inevitably, they sometimes go right. For in a complex undertaking,
    no matter how many times we fail, if we keep trying, there is often a good chance
    we will eventually succeed. In fact, economists like W. Brian Arthur argue that
    a concurrence of minor factors can even lead companies with no particular edge
    to come to dominate their competitors. “In the real world,” he wrote, “if several
    similar-sized firms entered a market together, small fortuitous events—unexpected
    orders, chance meetings with buyers, managerial whims—would help determine which
    ones received early sales and, over time, which came to dominate. Economic activity
    is…[determined] by individual transactions that are too small to foresee, and
    these small ‘random’ events could [ac]cumulate and become magnified by positive
    feedbacks over time.”[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts9a)

    the cultural industries—books, film, art, music. The conventional marketing wisdom
    in those fields is that success is achieved by anticipating consumer preference.
    In this view the most productive way for executives to spend their time is to
    study what it is about the likes of Stephen King, Madonna, or Bruce Willis that
    appeals to so many fans. They study the past and, as I’ve just argued, have no
    trouble extracting reasons for whatever success they are attempting to explain.

    individual songs varied widely among the different worlds, and different songs
    of similar intrinsic quality also varied widely in their popularity. For example,
    a song called “Lockdown” by a band called 52metro ranked twenty-six out of forty-eight

    song in another. In this experiment, as one song or another by chance got an early

    X, the fellow at the top of the list when the newcomer arrived, and that the rest

    became huge successes, it is hard to imagine the assemblage of Hollywood decision
    makers, upon seeing Willis, doing anything but lighting up stogies as they celebrated

    is easy, looking back, to dismiss the network executives as ignorant buffoons.
    In my experience, television producers often do, especially when the executives
    are out of earshot. But before we make that choice, consider this: television
    viewers at first agreed with the executives’ mediocre assessment. *Moonlighting*
    debuted in March 1985 to low ratings and continued with a mediocre performance
    through the rest of its first season. Only in the second season did viewers change
    their minds and the show become a major hit. Willis’s appeal and his success were
    apparently unforeseeable until, of course, he suddenly became a star. One might
    at this point chalk up the story to crazy Hollywood, but Willis’s drunkard’s walk
    to success is not at all unusual. A path punctuated by random impacts and unintended
    consequences is the path of many successful people, not only in their careers

    build a personal computer flew to Seattle to meet with the young computer entrepreneur,
    Bill Gates was running a small company and IBM needed a program, called an operating
    system, for its planned “home computer.” Recollections of the ensuing events vary,
    but the gist goes like this:[^(12)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts12a)
    Gates said he couldn’t provide the operating system and referred the IBM people
    to a famed programmer named Gary Kildall at Digital Research Inc. The talks between
    IBM and Kildall did not go well. For one thing, when IBM showed up at DRI’s offices,
    Kildall’s then wife, the company’s business manager, refused to sign IBM’s nondisclosure
    agreement. The IBM emissaries called again, and that time Kildall did meet with
    them. No one knows exactly what transpired in that meeting, but if an informal
    deal was made, it didn’t stick. Around that time one of the IBM employees, Jack
    Sams, saw Gates again. They both knew of another operating system that was available,
    a system that was, depending on whom you ask, based on or inspired by Kildall’s.
    According to Sams, Gates said, “Do you want to get…[that operating system], or
    do you want me to?” Sams, apparently not appreciating the implications, said,
    “By all means, you get it.” Gates did, for $50,000 (or, by some accounts, a bit
    more), made a few changes, and renamed it DOS (disk operating system). IBM, apparently
    with little faith in the potential of its new idea, licensed DOS from Gates for
    a low per-copy royalty fee, letting Gates retain the rights. DOS was no better—and
    many, including most computer professionals, would claim far worse—than, say,
    Apple’s Macintosh operating system. But the growing base of IBM users encouraged
    software developers to write for DOS, thereby encouraging prospective users to
    buy IBM machines, a circumstance that in turn encouraged software developers to
    write for DOS. In other words, as W. Brian Arthur would say, people bought DOS
    because people were buying DOS. In the fluid world of computer entrepreneurs,
    Gates became the molecule that broke from the pack. But had it not been for Kildall’s
    uncooperativeness, IBM’s lack of vision, or the second encounter between Sams
    and Gates, despite whatever visionary or business acumen Gates possesses, he might
    have become just another software entrepreneur rather than the richest man in
    the world, and that is probably why his vision seems like that of just that—another

  zh: 在1980年8月，当一群在秘密项目上工作的IBM员工飞往西雅图与年轻的计算机企业家比尔·盖茨会面时，比尔·盖茨正在经营一家小公司，而IBM需要为其计划中的“家用电脑”开发一个程序，即操作系统。关于随后发生事件的回忆各不相同，但大致情况如下：[^(12)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts12a)
    盖茨表示他无法提供操作系统，并将IBM的人推荐给了数字研究公司（Digital Research Inc.）的一位著名程序员，名叫加里·基尔代尔（Gary
    Kildall）。IBM与基尔代尔的谈判并不顺利。一方面，当IBM出现在DRI的办公室时，基尔代尔的当时妻子，公司的业务经理，拒绝签署IBM的非公开协议。IBM的使者再次来电，这次基尔代尔与他们见面了。没有人确切知道那次会议中发生了什么，但如果达成了非正式协议，它并没有持续下去。大约在这个时候，IBM的一名员工杰克·萨姆斯（Jack
    Sams）再次见到了盖茨。他们都知道另一个可用的操作系统，这个系统根据你询问的人不同，可能是基于或受到基尔代尔启发的。据萨姆斯说，盖茨说：“你是想要……[那个操作系统]，还是想要我帮你弄？”萨姆斯显然没有意识到其中的含义，回答说：“当然，你弄吧。”盖茨确实以5万美元（或者据某些说法，稍多）的价格，做了一些修改，并将其重新命名为DOS（磁盘操作系统）。显然，IBM对其新想法的潜力信心不足，以低廉的每份副本版税费率从盖茨那里获得了DOS的许可，让盖茨保留了权利。DOS并不比，比如说，苹果的Macintosh操作系统更好——许多计算机专业人士，包括大多数，都会认为它更差。但IBM用户基础的不断增长鼓励软件开发者为DOS编写软件，从而鼓励潜在用户购买IBM机器，这种情况反过来又鼓励软件开发者为DOS编写软件。换句话说，正如W.
    Brian Arthur所说，人们购买DOS是因为人们正在购买DOS。在计算机企业家流动的世界里，盖茨成为了脱离群体的一员。但如果没有基尔代尔的缺乏合作精神、IBM的缺乏远见，或者萨姆斯和盖茨的第二次相遇，尽管盖茨拥有任何先见之明或商业洞察力，他可能只是另一个软件企业家，而不是世界上最富有的人，这也可能是为什么他的愿景看起来就像另一个软件企业家一样的原因。

    of success, but even when we know for a fact that a person’s salary is completely
    random, many people cannot avoid making the intuitive judgment that salary is

    to sit in a small darkened auditorium facing a one-way mirror.[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts17a)
    From their seats these observers could gaze into a small well-lit room containing
    a table and two chairs. The observers were led to believe that two workers, Tom
    and Bill, would soon enter the room and work together for fifteen minutes unscrambling
    anagrams. The curtains in front of the viewing window were then closed, and Lerner
    told the observers that he would keep the curtains shut because the experiment
    would go better if they could hear but not see the workers, so that they would
    not be influenced by their appearance. He also told them that because his funds
    were limited, he could pay only one of the workers, who would be chosen at random.
    As Lerner left the room, an assistant threw a switch that began to play an audiotape.
    The observers believed they were listening in as Tom and Bill entered the room
    behind the curtain and began their work. Actually they were listening to a recording
    of Tom and Bill reading a fixed script, which had been constructed such that,
    by various objective measures, each of them appeared to be equally adept and successful
    at his task. Afterward the observers, not knowing this, were asked to rate Tom
    and Bill on their effort, creativity, and success. When Tom was selected to receive
    the payment, about 90 percent of the observers rated him as having made the greater
    contribution. When Bill was selected, about 70 percent of the observers rated
    him higher. Despite Tom and Bill’s equivalent performance and the observers’ knowledge
    that the pay was randomly assigned, the observers perceived the worker who got
    paid as being better than the one who had worked for nothing. Alas, as all of

    Everyone knows that bosses with the right social and academic credentials and
    a nice title and salary have at times put a higher value on their own ideas than
    on those of their underlings. Researchers wondered, will people who earn more
    money purely by chance behave the same way? Does even unearned “success” instill
    a feeling of superiority? To find out, pairs of volunteers were asked to cooperate
    on various pointless tasks. In one task, for instance, a black-and-white image
    was briefly displayed and the subjects had to decide whether the top or the bottom
    of the image contained a greater proportion of white. Before each task began,
    one of the subjects was randomly chosen to receive considerably more pay for participating
    than the other. When that information was not made available, the subjects cooperated
    pretty harmoniously. But when they knew how much they each were getting paid,
    the higher-paid subjects exhibited more resistance to input from their partners
    than the lower-paid ones. Even random differences in pay lead to the backward
    inference of differences in skill and hence to the development of unequal influence.
    It’s an element of personal and office dynamics that cannot be ignored.

    by their peer’s unjust suffering. But as the experiment continued, their sympathy
    for the victim began to erode. Eventually the observers, powerless to help, instead
    began to denigrate the victim. The more the victim suffered, the lower their opinion
    of her became. As Lerner had predicted, the observers had a need to understand
    the situation in terms of cause and effect. To be certain that some other dynamic
    wasn’t really at work, the experiment was repeated with other groups of subjects,
    who were told that the victim would be well compensated for her pain. In other
    words, these subjects believed that the victim was being “fairly” treated but

    In that study each of eight “pseudopatients” made an appointment at one of a variety
    of hospitals and then showed up at the admissions office complaining that they
    were hearing strange voices. The pseudopatients were a varied group: three psychologists,
    a psychiatrist, a pediatrician, a student, a painter, and a housewife. Other than
    alleging that single symptom and reporting false names and vocations, they all
    described their lives with complete honesty. Confident in the clockwork operation

    Marketers also know this and design ad campaigns to create and then exploit our
    expectations. One arena in which that was done very effectively is the vodka market.
    Vodka is a neutral spirit, distilled, according to the U.S. government definition,
    “as to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste or color.” Most American
    vodkas originate, therefore, not with passionate, flannel-shirted men like those
    who create wines, but with corporate giants like the agrochemical supplier Archer
    Daniels Midland. And the job of the vodka distiller is not to nurture an aging
    process that imparts finely nuanced flavor but to take the 190-proof industrial
    swill such suppliers provide, add water, and *subtract* as much of the taste as
    possible. Through massive image-building campaigns, however, vodka producers have
    managed to create very strong expectations of difference. As a result, people
    believe that this liquor, which by its very *definition* is without a distinctive
    character, actually varies greatly from brand to brand. Moreover, they are willing
    to pay large amounts of money based on those differences. Lest I be dismissed
    as a tasteless boor, I wish to point out that there is a way to test my ravings.
    You could line up a series of vodkas and a series of vodka sophisticates and perform
    a blind tasting. As it happens, *The New York Times* did just that.[^(22)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts22a)
    And without their labels, fancy vodkas like Grey Goose and Ketel One didn’t fare
    so well. Compared with conventional wisdom, in fact, the results appeared random.
    Moreover, of the twenty-one vodkas tasted, it was the cheap bar brand, Smirnoff,
    that came out at the top of the list. Our assessment of the world would be quite
    different if all our judgments could be insulated from expectation and based only

- en: Another physicist I knew had a story that was strikingly similar to John’s.
    He was, coincidentally, John’s PhD adviser at the University of California, Berkeley.
    Considered one of the most brilliant scientists of his generation, this physicist
    was a leader in an area of research called S-matrix theory. Like John, he was
    stubbornly persistent and continued to work on his theory for years after others
    had given up. But unlike John, he did not succeed. And because of his lack of
    success he ended his career with many people thinking him a crackpot. But in my
    opinion both he and John were brilliant physicists with the courage to work—with
    no promise of an imminent breakthrough—on a theory that had gone out of style.
    And just as authors should be judged by their writing and not their books’ sales,
    so physicists—and all who strive to achieve—should be judged more by their abilities
    than by their success.

  zh: 我认识的另一位物理学家有一个故事，与约翰的故事惊人地相似。他碰巧是约翰在加州大学伯克利分校的博士导师。这位物理学家被认为是他们那一代最杰出的科学家之一，他在一个被称为S矩阵理论的研究领域是领导者。像约翰一样，他固执地坚持自己的理论，在其他人放弃之后，他仍然继续研究了几年的时间。但与约翰不同的是，他没有成功。正因为他的不成功，他在许多人眼中结束了自己的职业生涯，被认为是一个怪人。但在我看来，他和约翰都是杰出的物理学家，他们有勇气在没有立即突破的承诺下工作——对一个已经过时的理论进行研究。正如作者应该根据他们的写作而不是他们的书籍销量来评判一样，物理学家——以及所有努力实现目标的人——应该更多地根据他们的能力而不是他们的成功来评判。
- en: The cord that tethers ability to success is both loose and elastic. It is easy
    to see fine qualities in successful books or to see unpublished manuscripts, inexpensive
    vodkas, or people struggling in any field as somehow lacking. It is easy to believe
    that ideas that worked were good ideas, that plans that succeeded were well designed,
    and that ideas and plans that did not were ill conceived. And it is easy to make
    heroes out of the most successful and to glance with disdain at the least. But
    ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability.
    And so it is important to always keep in mind the other term in the equation—the
    role of chance.

  zh: 将能力与成功联系起来的绳子既松又弹性。很容易看到成功书籍中的优点，或者看到未发表的稿件，便宜的伏特加，或者在任何领域挣扎的人们似乎有所欠缺。很容易相信那些起作用的想法是好的想法，那些成功的计划是精心设计的，而那些不起作用的想法和计划是构思不当的。而且很容易将最成功的人捧为英雄，对最不成功的人不屑一顾。但能力并不能保证成就，成就与能力也不成比例。因此，始终记住等式中的另一个术语——运气的作用是很重要的。
- en: 'It is no tragedy to think of the most successful people in any field as superheroes.
    But it is a tragedy when a belief in the judgment of experts or the marketplace
    rather than a belief in ourselves causes us to give up, as John Kennedy Toole
    did when he committed suicide after publishers repeatedly rejected his manuscript
    for the posthumously best-selling *Confederacy of Dunces.* And so when tempted
    to judge someone by his or her degree of success, I like to remind myself that
    were they to start over, Stephen King might be only a Richard Bachman and V. S.
    Naipaul just another struggling author, and somewhere out there roam the equals
    of Bill Gates and Bruce Willis and Roger Maris who are not rich and famous, equals
    on whom Fortune did not bestow the right breakthrough product or TV show or year.
    What I’ve learned, above all, is to keep marching forward because the best news
    is that since chance does play a role, one important factor in success *is* under
    our control: the number of at bats, the number of chances taken, the number of
    opportunities seized. For even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land
    on success. Or as the IBM pioneer Thomas Watson said, “If you want to succeed,
    double your failure rate.”'

  zh: 将任何领域的最成功的人视为超级英雄并不是什么悲剧。但当对专家或市场的判断而不是对自己的信念导致我们放弃，就像约翰·肯尼迪·图尔在出版商反复拒绝他的遗作《傻瓜联盟》的手稿后自杀一样，这就是一个悲剧。因此，当被诱惑根据一个人的成功程度来评判他时，我喜欢提醒自己，如果他们重新开始，斯蒂芬·金可能只是一个理查德·巴赫曼，V.S.奈保尔可能只是另一个挣扎的作家，而某个地方可能游荡着比尔·盖茨、布鲁斯·威利斯和罗杰·马里斯等人的同等人物，他们并不富有和著名，他们没有得到财富杂志赋予的正确突破产品或电视节目或年份。我所学到的最重要的是，要继续前进，因为最好的消息是，既然运气确实起着作用，成功的一个重要因素*确实*在我们自己的控制之下：击球次数，所尝试的机会次数，所抓住的机会次数。即使是一个倾向于失败的钱币有时也会落在成功的面上。或者，正如IBM先驱托马斯·沃森所说：“如果你想成功，加倍你的失败率。”
- en: I have tried in this book to present the basic concepts of randomness, to illustrate
    how they apply to human affairs, and to present my view that its effects are largely
    overlooked in our interpretations of events and in our expectations and decisions.
    It may come as an epiphany merely to recognize the ubiquitous role of random processes
    in our lives; the true power of the theory of random processes, however, lies
    in the fact that once we understand the nature of random processes, we can alter
    the way we perceive the events that happen around us.

  zh: 在这本书中，我试图介绍随机性的基本概念，说明它们如何应用于人类事务，并表达我的观点，即我们在对事件的解释、期望和决策中很大程度上忽视了随机过程的影响。仅仅认识到随机过程在我们生活中的普遍作用可能只是一个顿悟；然而，随机过程理论的真正力量在于，一旦我们理解了随机过程的本质，我们就可以改变我们感知周围事件的方式。
- en: The psychologist David Rosenhan wrote that “once a person is abnormal, all of
    his other behaviors and characteristics are colored by that label.”[^(25)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts25a)
    The same applies for stardom, for many other labels of success, and for those
    of failure. We judge people and initiatives by their results, and we expect events
    to happen for good, understandable reasons. But our clear visions of inevitability
    are often only illusions. I wrote this book in the belief that we can reorganize
    our thinking in the face of uncertainty. We can improve our skill at decision
    making and tame some of the biases that lead us to make poor judgments and poor
    choices. We can seek to understand people’s qualities or the qualities of a situation
    quite apart from the results they attain, and we can learn to judge decisions
    by the spectrum of potential outcomes they might have produced rather than by
    the particular result that actually occurred.

    同样，这也适用于成名，以及许多其他成功的标签和失败的标签。我们根据人们的结果来判断他们和他们的倡议，并期望事件发生有好的、可理解的原因。但我们对必然性的清晰愿景往往只是错觉。我写这本书的信念是，面对不确定性，我们可以重新组织我们的思维方式。我们可以提高我们的决策技能，并驯服一些导致我们做出不良判断和选择的偏见。我们可以试图理解人们的品质或情境的品质，而不仅仅是他们所取得的结果，并且我们可以学会通过可能产生的潜在结果范围来判断决策，而不是通过实际发生的结果来判断。
- en: My mother always warned me not to think I could predict or control the future.
    She once related the incident that converted her to that belief. It concerned
    her sister, Sabina, of whom she still often speaks although it has been over sixty-five
    years since she last saw her. Sabina was seventeen. My mother, who idolized her
    as younger siblings sometimes do their older siblings, was fifteen. The Nazis
    had invaded Poland, and my father, from the poor section of town, had joined the
    underground and, as I said earlier, eventually ended up in Buchenwald. My mother,
    who didn’t know him then, came from the wealthy part of town and ended up in a
    forced-labor camp. There she was given the job of nurse’s aide and took care of
    patients suffering from typhus. Food was scarce, and random death was always near.
    To help protect my mother from the ever-present dangers, Sabina agreed to a plan.
    She had a friend who was a member of the Jewish police, a group, generally despised
    by the inmates, who carried out the Germans’ commands and helped keep order in
    the camp. Sabina’s friend had offered to marry her—a marriage in name only—so
    that Sabina might obtain the protections that his position afforded. Sabina, thinking
    those protections would extend to my mother, agreed. For a while it worked. Then
    something happened, and the Nazis soured on the Jewish police. They sent a number
    of officers to the gas chambers, along with their spouses—including Sabina’s husband
    and Sabina herself. My mother has lived now for many more years without Sabina
    than she had lived with her, but Sabina’s death still haunts her. My mother worries
    that when she is gone, there will no longer be any trace that Sabina ever existed.
    To her this story shows that it is pointless to make plans. I do not agree. I
    believe it is important to plan, if we do so with our eyes open. But more important,
    my mother’s experience has taught me that we ought to identify and appreciate
    the good luck that we have and recognize the random events that contribute to
    our success. It has taught me, too, to accept the chance events that may cause
    us grief. Most of all it has taught me to appreciate the absence of bad luck,
    the absence of events that might have brought us down, and the absence of the
    disease, war, famine, and accident that have not—or have not yet—befallen us.
