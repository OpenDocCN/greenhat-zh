    describe the system of interest, allowing no unforeseen influences. Finally, we
    must have sufficient intelligence or computing power to be able to decide what,
    given the data about the present, the laws say the future will hold. In this book
    we’ve examined many concepts that aid our understanding of random phenomena. Along

    expected the computer to regenerate the remainder of the previous simulation and
    then carry it further. But instead he noticed something strange: the weather had
    evolved differently. Rather than duplicating the end of the previous simulation,
    the new one diverged wildly. He soon recognized why: in the computer’s memory
    the data were stored to six decimal places, but in the printout they were quoted
    to only three. As a result, the data he had supplied were a tiny bit off. A number
    like 0.293416, for example, would have appeared simply as 0.293.'

- en: Scientists usually assume that if the initial conditions of a system are altered
    slightly, the evolution of that system, too, will be altered slightly. After all,
    the satellites that collect weather data can measure parameters to only two or
    three decimal places, and so they cannot even track a difference as tiny as that
    between 0.293416 and 0.293\. But Lorenz found that such small differences led
    to massive changes in the result.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts2a)
    The phenomenon was dubbed the butterfly effect, based on the implication that
    atmospheric changes so small they could have been caused by a butterfly flapping
    its wings can have a large effect on subsequent global weather patterns. That
    notion might sound absurd—the equivalent of the extra cup of coffee you sip one
    morning leading to profound changes in your life. But actually that does happen—for
    instance, if the extra time you spent caused you to cross paths with your future
    wife at the train station or to miss being hit by a car that sped through a red
    light. In fact, Lorenz’s story is itself an example of the butterfly effect, for
    if he hadn’t taken the minor decision to extend his calculation employing the
    shortcut, he would not have discovered the butterfly effect, a discovery which
    sparked a whole new field of mathematics. When we look back in detail on the major

- en: Determinism in human affairs fails to meet the requirements for predictability
    alluded to by Laplace for several reasons. First, as far as we know, society is
    not governed by definite and fundamental laws in the way physics is. Instead,
    people’s behavior is not only unpredictable, but as Kahneman and Tversky repeatedly
    showed, also often irrational (in the sense that we act against our best interests).
    Second, even if we could uncover the laws of human affairs, as Quételet attempted
    to do, it is impossible to precisely know or control the circumstances of life.
    That is, like Lorenz, we cannot obtain the precise data necessary for making predictions.
    And third, human affairs are so complex that it is doubtful we could carry out
    the necessary calculations even if we understood the laws and possessed the data.
    As a result, determinism is a poor model for the human experience. Or as the Nobel
    laureate Max Born wrote, “Chance is a more fundamental conception than causality.”[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts3a)

    to those areas. Of special interest were battleships, destroyers, and aircraft
    carriers, as well as information regarding the anchoring of more than one ship
    at a single dock. Some weeks later another curious incident occurred: U.S. monitors
    lost track of radio communications from all known carriers in the first and second
    Japanese fleets, losing with it all knowledge of their whereabouts. Then in early
    December the Combat Intelligence Unit of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii
    reported that the Japanese had changed their call signs for the second time in
    a month. Call signs, such as WCBS or KNPR, are designations identifying the source
    of a radio transmission. In wartime they reveal the identity of a source not only
    to friend but also to foe, so they are periodically altered. The Japanese had
    a habit of changing them every six months or more. To change them twice in thirty
    days was considered a “step in preparing for active operations on a large scale.”

- en: In any complex string of events in which each event unfolds with some element
    of uncertainty, there is a fundamental asymmetry between past and future. This
    asymmetry has been the subject of scientific study ever since Boltzmann made his
    statistical analysis of the molecular processes responsible for the properties
    of fluids (see chapter 8). Imagine, for example, a dye molecule floating in a
    glass of water. The molecule will, like one of Brown’s granules, follow a drunkard’s
    walk. But even that aimless movement makes progress in some direction. If you
    wait three hours, for example, the molecule will typically have traveled about
    an inch from where it started. Suppose that at some point the molecule moves to
    a position of significance and so finally attracts our attention. As many did
    after Pearl Harbor, we might look for the reason why that unexpected event occurred.
    Now suppose we dig into the molecule’s past. Suppose, in fact, we trace the record
    of all its collisions. We will indeed discover how first this bump from a water
    molecule and then that one propelled the dye molecule on its zigzag path from
    there to here. In hindsight, in other words, we can clearly explain why the past
    of the dye molecule developed as it did. But the water contains many other water
    molecules that *could have* been the ones that interacted with the dye molecule.
    To predict the dye molecule’s path *beforehand* would have therefore required
    us to calculate the paths and mutual interactions of all those potentially important
    water molecules. That would have involved an almost unimaginable number of mathematical
    calculations, far greater in scope and difficulty than the list of collisions
    needed to understand the past. In other words, the movement of the dye molecule
    was virtually impossible to predict before the fact even though it was relatively
    easy to understand afterward.

    There were high-paid consultants, lengthy marketing meetings, late-night financial-analysis
    sessions, long offsite afternoon powwows. In the end, hunches were turned into
    formulas claiming the precision of several decimal places, and wild guesses were

    as well as expected or others sold better than projected, reasons were found and
    the appropriate employees blamed or credited as if the initial expectations had
    been meaningful. The next year saw a series of unforeseen price wars started by
    two competitors. The year after that the market for educational software collapsed.
    As the uncertainty compounded, the three-year plan never had a chance to succeed.

    20/20, but people often behave as if the adage weren’t true. In government, for
    example, a should-have-known-it blame game is played after every tragedy. In the
    case of Pearl Harbor (and the September 11 attacks) the events leading up to the
    attack, when we look back at them, certainly seem to point in an obvious direction.
    Yet as with the dye molecule, the weather, or the chess game, if you start well
    before the fact and trace events forward, the feeling of inevitability quickly
    dissolves. For one thing, in addition to the intelligence reports I quoted, there
    was a huge amount of useless intelligence, with each week bringing new reams of
    sometimes alarming or mysterious messages and transcripts that would later prove
    misleading or insignificant. And even if we focused on the reports that hindsight
    tells us were important, before the attack there existed for each of those reports
    a reasonable alternative explanation that did not point toward a surprise attack
    on Pearl Harbor. For example, the request to divide Pearl Harbor into five areas
    was similar in style to other requests that had gone to Japanese agents in Panama,
    Vancouver, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. The loss of radio contact was
    also not unheard of and had in the past often meant simply that the warships were
    in home waters and communicating via telegraphic landlines. Moreover, even if
    you believed a broadening of the war was impending, many signs pointed toward
    an attack elsewhere—in the Philippines, on the Thai peninsula, or on Guam, for
    example. There were not, to be sure, as many red herrings as water molecules encountered
    by a molecule of dye, but there were enough to obscure a clear vision of the future.

    of discovering why the military had missed all the “signs” of a coming attack.
    Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, for one, drew heavy criticism for
    a May 1941 memo to President Roosevelt in which he wrote that “the Island of Oahu,
    due to its fortification, its garrison and its physical characteristic, is believed
    to be the strongest fortress in the world” and reassured the president that, in
    case of attack, enemy forces would be intercepted “within 200 miles of their objective…by
    all types of bombardment.” General Marshall was no fool, but neither did he have
    a crystal ball. The study of randomness tells us that the crystal ball view of
    events is possible, unfortunately, only after they happen. And so we believe we

    It resulted in a partial meltdown of the core, in which the nuclear reaction occurs,
    threatening to release into the environment an alarming dose of radiation. The
    mishap began when a cup or so of water emerged through a leaky seal from a water
    filter called a polisher. The leaked water entered a pneumatic system that drives
    some of the plant’s instruments, tripping two valves. The tripped valves shut
    down the flow of cold water to the plant’s steam generator—the system responsible
    for removing the heat generated by the nuclear reaction in the core. An emergency
    water pump then came on, but a valve in each of its two pipes had been left in
    a closed position after maintenance two days earlier. The pumps therefore were
    pumping water uselessly toward a dead end. Moreover, a pressure-relief valve also
    failed, as did a gauge in the control room that ought to have shown that the valve
    was not working.

    这导致了反应堆部分熔化，其中核反应发生，威胁向环境释放令人担忧的辐射剂量。事故始于一杯左右的水从称为抛光机的过滤器的一个泄漏的密封处流出。泄漏的水进入了一个气动系统，该系统驱动电站的一些仪器，触发了两个阀门。触发的阀门切断了冷水流向电站的蒸汽发生器——这是负责从反应堆核心产生的核反应中移除热量的系统。随后启动了应急水泵，但两天前维护后，其两条管道中的每个阀门都处于关闭位置。因此，水泵在向一个死胡同泵送水，毫无用处。此外，压力释放阀也失败了，控制室中的仪表也失败了，该仪表本应显示阀门没有工作。
- en: 'Viewed separately, each of the failures was of a type considered both commonplace
    and acceptable. Polisher problems were not unusual at the plant, nor were they
    normally very serious; with hundreds of valves regularly being opened or closed
    in a nuclear power plant, leaving some valves in the wrong position was not considered
    rare or alarming; and the pressure-relief valve was known to be somewhat unreliable
    and had failed at times without major consequences in at least eleven other power
    plants. Yet strung together, these failures make the plant seem as if it had been
    run by the Keystone Kops. And so after the incident at Three Mile Island came
    many investigations and much laying of blame, as well as a very different consequence.
    That string of events spurred Yale sociologist Charles Perrow to create a new
    theory of accidents, in which is codified the central argument of this chapter:
    in complex systems (among which I count our lives) we should expect that minor
    factors we can usually ignore will by chance sometimes cause major incidents.[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts8a)'

    Perrow）提出了一个新的事故理论，其中规定了本章的核心论点：在复杂系统中（其中包括我自己的生活），我们应该预期通常可以忽略的微小因素有时会偶然导致重大事件。[⁸](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts8a)
- en: In his theory Perrow recognized that modern systems are made up of thousands
    of parts, including fallible human decision makers, which interrelate in ways
    that are, like Laplace’s atoms, impossible to track and anticipate individually.
    Yet one can bet on the fact that just as atoms executing a drunkard’s walk will
    eventually get somewhere, so too will accidents eventually occur. Called normal
    accident theory, Perrow’s doctrine describes how that happens—how accidents can
    occur without clear causes, without those glaring errors and incompetent villains
    sought by corporate or government commissions. But although normal accident theory
    is a theory of why, inevitably, things sometimes go wrong, it could also be flipped
    around to explain why, inevitably, they sometimes go right. For in a complex undertaking,
    no matter how many times we fail, if we keep trying, there is often a good chance
    we will eventually succeed. In fact, economists like W. Brian Arthur argue that
    a concurrence of minor factors can even lead companies with no particular edge
    to come to dominate their competitors. “In the real world,” he wrote, “if several
    similar-sized firms entered a market together, small fortuitous events—unexpected
    orders, chance meetings with buyers, managerial whims—would help determine which
    ones received early sales and, over time, which came to dominate. Economic activity
    is…[determined] by individual transactions that are too small to foresee, and
    these small ‘random’ events could [ac]cumulate and become magnified by positive
    feedbacks over time.”[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts9a)

    Brian Arthur这样的经济学家认为，微小的因素的巧合甚至可以使没有特别优势的公司主导其竞争对手。“在现实世界中，”他写道，“如果几家规模相似的公司同时进入市场，一些小的偶然事件——意外的订单、与买家的偶然相遇、管理层的异想天开——将有助于决定哪些公司获得了早期的销售，随着时间的推移，哪些公司最终占据了主导地位。经济活动是由单个交易决定的，这些交易太小，无法预见，而这些小的‘随机’事件可能会随着时间的推移通过正反馈积累并放大。”[⁹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts9a)

    其中一场是在选角进入最后阶段的电视剧。制片人已经有一份心目中的决赛选手名单，但在好莱坞，除非合同上的墨水干了，诉讼结束，否则没有什么是最终的。威利斯获得了试镜机会，并成功获得了角色——那就是与西比尔·谢泼德搭档的新ABC电视剧《月光下的阴影》中的男主角大卫·艾迪生。
- en: 'It might be tempting to believe that Willis was the obvious choice over Mr.
    X, the fellow at the top of the list when the newcomer arrived, and that the rest
    is, as they say, history. Since in hindsight we know that *Moonlighting* and Willis
    became huge successes, it is hard to imagine the assemblage of Hollywood decision
    makers, upon seeing Willis, doing anything but lighting up stogies as they celebrated
    their brilliant discovery and put to flame their now-outmoded list of finalists.
    But what really happened at the casting session is more like what you get when
    you send your kids out for a single gallon of ice cream and two want strawberry
    while the third demands triple-chocolate-fudge brownie. The network executives
    fought for Mr. X, their judgment being that Willis did not look like a serious
    lead. Glenn Caron, *Moonlighting*’s executive producer, argued for Willis. It
    is easy, looking back, to dismiss the network executives as ignorant buffoons.
    In my experience, television producers often do, especially when the executives
    are out of earshot. But before we make that choice, consider this: television
    viewers at first agreed with the executives’ mediocre assessment. *Moonlighting*
    debuted in March 1985 to low ratings and continued with a mediocre performance
    through the rest of its first season. Only in the second season did viewers change
    their minds and the show become a major hit. Willis’s appeal and his success were
    apparently unforeseeable until, of course, he suddenly became a star. One might
    at this point chalk up the story to crazy Hollywood, but Willis’s drunkard’s walk
    to success is not at all unusual. A path punctuated by random impacts and unintended
    consequences is the path of many successful people, not only in their careers
    but also in their loves, hobbies, and friendships. In fact, it is more the rule
    than the exception.'

    Caron）为威尔士辩护。回顾过去，很容易将网络高管们视为无知的小丑。根据我的经验，电视制片人经常这样做，尤其是在高管们听不见的时候。但在我们做出选择之前，考虑一下这个：电视观众最初同意高管们平庸的评估。《月光光》于1985年3月首播，收视率很低，整个第一季的表现都相当平庸。只有在第二季，观众们才改变主意，这部剧才成为一部大热门。威尔士的魅力和成功似乎直到他突然成为明星之前都是不可预见的。这个故事可能被归咎于疯狂的好莱坞，但威尔士的成功之路并不罕见。被随机冲击和意外后果所打断的道路是许多成功人士的道路，不仅在他们的职业生涯中，也在他们的爱情、爱好和友谊中。事实上，这与其说是例外，不如说是规则。

- en: In August 1980, when a group of IBM employees working on a secret project to
    build a personal computer flew to Seattle to meet with the young computer entrepreneur,
    Bill Gates was running a small company and IBM needed a program, called an operating
    system, for its planned “home computer.” Recollections of the ensuing events vary,
    but the gist goes like this:[^(12)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts12a)
    Gates said he couldn’t provide the operating system and referred the IBM people
    to a famed programmer named Gary Kildall at Digital Research Inc. The talks between
    IBM and Kildall did not go well. For one thing, when IBM showed up at DRI’s offices,
    Kildall’s then wife, the company’s business manager, refused to sign IBM’s nondisclosure
    agreement. The IBM emissaries called again, and that time Kildall did meet with
    them. No one knows exactly what transpired in that meeting, but if an informal
    deal was made, it didn’t stick. Around that time one of the IBM employees, Jack
    Sams, saw Gates again. They both knew of another operating system that was available,
    a system that was, depending on whom you ask, based on or inspired by Kildall’s.
    According to Sams, Gates said, “Do you want to get…[that operating system], or
    do you want me to?” Sams, apparently not appreciating the implications, said,
    “By all means, you get it.” Gates did, for $50,000 (or, by some accounts, a bit
    more), made a few changes, and renamed it DOS (disk operating system). IBM, apparently
    with little faith in the potential of its new idea, licensed DOS from Gates for
    a low per-copy royalty fee, letting Gates retain the rights. DOS was no better—and
    many, including most computer professionals, would claim far worse—than, say,
    Apple’s Macintosh operating system. But the growing base of IBM users encouraged
    software developers to write for DOS, thereby encouraging prospective users to
    buy IBM machines, a circumstance that in turn encouraged software developers to
    write for DOS. In other words, as W. Brian Arthur would say, people bought DOS
    because people were buying DOS. In the fluid world of computer entrepreneurs,
    Gates became the molecule that broke from the pack. But had it not been for Kildall’s
    uncooperativeness, IBM’s lack of vision, or the second encounter between Sams
    and Gates, despite whatever visionary or business acumen Gates possesses, he might
    have become just another software entrepreneur rather than the richest man in
    the world, and that is probably why his vision seems like that of just that—another
    software entrepreneur.

  zh: 在1980年8月，当一群在秘密项目上工作的IBM员工飞往西雅图与年轻的计算机企业家比尔·盖茨会面时，比尔·盖茨正在经营一家小公司，而IBM需要为其计划中的“家用电脑”开发一个程序，即操作系统。关于随后发生事件的回忆各不相同，但大致情况如下：[^(12)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts12a)
    盖茨表示他无法提供操作系统，并将IBM的人推荐给了数字研究公司（Digital Research Inc.）的一位著名程序员，名叫加里·基尔代尔（Gary
    Kildall）。IBM与基尔代尔的谈判并不顺利。一方面，当IBM出现在DRI的办公室时，基尔代尔的当时妻子，公司的业务经理，拒绝签署IBM的非公开协议。IBM的使者再次来电，这次基尔代尔与他们见面了。没有人确切知道那次会议中发生了什么，但如果达成了非正式协议，它并没有持续下去。大约在这个时候，IBM的一名员工杰克·萨姆斯（Jack
    Sams）再次见到了盖茨。他们都知道另一个可用的操作系统，这个系统根据你询问的人不同，可能是基于或受到基尔代尔启发的。据萨姆斯说，盖茨说：“你是想要……[那个操作系统]，还是想要我帮你弄？”萨姆斯显然没有意识到其中的含义，回答说：“当然，你弄吧。”盖茨确实以5万美元（或者据某些说法，稍多）的价格，做了一些修改，并将其重新命名为DOS（磁盘操作系统）。显然，IBM对其新想法的潜力信心不足，以低廉的每份副本版税费率从盖茨那里获得了DOS的许可，让盖茨保留了权利。DOS并不比，比如说，苹果的Macintosh操作系统更好——许多计算机专业人士，包括大多数，都会认为它更差。但IBM用户基础的不断增长鼓励软件开发者为DOS编写软件，从而鼓励潜在用户购买IBM机器，这种情况反过来又鼓励软件开发者为DOS编写软件。换句话说，正如W.
    Brian Arthur所说，人们购买DOS是因为人们正在购买DOS。在计算机企业家流动的世界里，盖茨成为了脱离群体的一员。但如果没有基尔代尔的缺乏合作精神、IBM的缺乏远见，或者萨姆斯和盖茨的第二次相遇，尽管盖茨拥有任何先见之明或商业洞察力，他可能只是另一个软件企业家，而不是世界上最富有的人，这也可能是为什么他的愿景看起来就像另一个软件企业家一样的原因。

    From their seats these observers could gaze into a small well-lit room containing
    a table and two chairs. The observers were led to believe that two workers, Tom
    and Bill, would soon enter the room and work together for fifteen minutes unscrambling
    anagrams. The curtains in front of the viewing window were then closed, and Lerner
    told the observers that he would keep the curtains shut because the experiment
    would go better if they could hear but not see the workers, so that they would
    not be influenced by their appearance. He also told them that because his funds
    were limited, he could pay only one of the workers, who would be chosen at random.
    As Lerner left the room, an assistant threw a switch that began to play an audiotape.
    The observers believed they were listening in as Tom and Bill entered the room
    behind the curtain and began their work. Actually they were listening to a recording
    of Tom and Bill reading a fixed script, which had been constructed such that,
    by various objective measures, each of them appeared to be equally adept and successful
    at his task. Afterward the observers, not knowing this, were asked to rate Tom
    and Bill on their effort, creativity, and success. When Tom was selected to receive
    the payment, about 90 percent of the observers rated him as having made the greater
    contribution. When Bill was selected, about 70 percent of the observers rated
    him higher. Despite Tom and Bill’s equivalent performance and the observers’ knowledge
    that the pay was randomly assigned, the observers perceived the worker who got
    paid as being better than the one who had worked for nothing. Alas, as all of

    Everyone knows that bosses with the right social and academic credentials and

    on those of their underlings. Researchers wondered, will people who earn more
    money purely by chance behave the same way? Does even unearned “success” instill
    a feeling of superiority? To find out, pairs of volunteers were asked to cooperate
    on various pointless tasks. In one task, for instance, a black-and-white image
    was briefly displayed and the subjects had to decide whether the top or the bottom
    of the image contained a greater proportion of white. Before each task began,
    one of the subjects was randomly chosen to receive considerably more pay for participating
    than the other. When that information was not made available, the subjects cooperated
    pretty harmoniously. But when they knew how much they each were getting paid,
    the higher-paid subjects exhibited more resistance to input from their partners
    than the lower-paid ones. Even random differences in pay lead to the backward
    inference of differences in skill and hence to the development of unequal influence.

    for the staff to notice that they were not, in fact, insane. None of the staff
    noticed. Instead, the hospital workers interpreted the pseudopatients’ behavior
    through the lens of insanity. When one patient was observed writing in his diary,
    it was noted in the nursing record that “patient engages in writing behavior,”
    identifying the writing as a sign of mental illness. When another patient had
    an outburst while being mistreated by an attendant, the behavior was also assumed
    to be part of the patient’s pathology. Even the act of arriving at the cafeteria
    before it opened for lunch was seen as a symptom of insanity. Other patients,
    unimpressed by formal medical diagnoses, would regularly challenge the pseudopatients
    with comments like “You’re not crazy. You’re a journalist…you’re checking up on
    the hospital.” The pseudopatients’ doctors, however, wrote notes like “This white
    39-year-old male…manifests a long history of considerable ambivalence in close
    relationships, which begins in early childhood. A warm relationship with his mother
    cools during adolescence. A distant relationship with his father is described

    That is why struggling people in Hollywood work hard to look as though they are
    not struggling, why doctors wear white coats and place all manner of certificates

    on the outside of a car than sink money into engine work, and why teachers will,

    Marketers also know this and design ad campaigns to create and then exploit our
    expectations. One arena in which that was done very effectively is the vodka market.
    Vodka is a neutral spirit, distilled, according to the U.S. government definition,
    “as to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste or color.” Most American
    vodkas originate, therefore, not with passionate, flannel-shirted men like those
    who create wines, but with corporate giants like the agrochemical supplier Archer
    Daniels Midland. And the job of the vodka distiller is not to nurture an aging
    process that imparts finely nuanced flavor but to take the 190-proof industrial
    swill such suppliers provide, add water, and *subtract* as much of the taste as
    possible. Through massive image-building campaigns, however, vodka producers have
    managed to create very strong expectations of difference. As a result, people
    believe that this liquor, which by its very *definition* is without a distinctive
    character, actually varies greatly from brand to brand. Moreover, they are willing
    to pay large amounts of money based on those differences. Lest I be dismissed
    as a tasteless boor, I wish to point out that there is a way to test my ravings.
    You could line up a series of vodkas and a series of vodka sophisticates and perform
    a blind tasting. As it happens, *The New York Times* did just that.[^(22)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c10-nts22a)
    And without their labels, fancy vodkas like Grey Goose and Ketel One didn’t fare
    so well. Compared with conventional wisdom, in fact, the results appeared random.
    Moreover, of the twenty-one vodkas tasted, it was the cheap bar brand, Smirnoff,
    that came out at the top of the list. Our assessment of the world would be quite
    different if all our judgments could be insulated from expectation and based only
    on relevant data.

    physicist named John Schwarz. He was getting little recognition and had suffered
    a decade of ridicule as he almost single-handedly kept alive a discredited theory,
    called string theory, which predicted that space has many more dimensions than
    the three we observe. Then one day he and a co-worker made a technical breakthrough,
    and for reasons that need not concern us here, suddenly the extra dimensions sounded
    more acceptable. String theory has been the hottest thing in physics ever since.
    Today John is considered one of the brilliant elder statesmen of physics, yet
    had he let the years of obscurity get to him, he would have been a testament to

    was a leader in an area of research called S-matrix theory. Like John, he was
    stubbornly persistent and continued to work on his theory for years after others
    had given up. But unlike John, he did not succeed. And because of his lack of
    success he ended his career with many people thinking him a crackpot. But in my
    opinion both he and John were brilliant physicists with the courage to work—with
    no promise of an imminent breakthrough—on a theory that had gone out of style.

    She once related the incident that converted her to that belief. It concerned
    her sister, Sabina, of whom she still often speaks although it has been over sixty-five
    years since she last saw her. Sabina was seventeen. My mother, who idolized her
    as younger siblings sometimes do their older siblings, was fifteen. The Nazis
    had invaded Poland, and my father, from the poor section of town, had joined the
    underground and, as I said earlier, eventually ended up in Buchenwald. My mother,
    who didn’t know him then, came from the wealthy part of town and ended up in a
    forced-labor camp. There she was given the job of nurse’s aide and took care of
    patients suffering from typhus. Food was scarce, and random death was always near.
    To help protect my mother from the ever-present dangers, Sabina agreed to a plan.
    She had a friend who was a member of the Jewish police, a group, generally despised
    by the inmates, who carried out the Germans’ commands and helped keep order in
    the camp. Sabina’s friend had offered to marry her—a marriage in name only—so
    that Sabina might obtain the protections that his position afforded. Sabina, thinking
    those protections would extend to my mother, agreed. For a while it worked. Then
    something happened, and the Nazis soured on the Jewish police. They sent a number
    of officers to the gas chambers, along with their spouses—including Sabina’s husband
    and Sabina herself. My mother has lived now for many more years without Sabina
    than she had lived with her, but Sabina’s death still haunts her. My mother worries
    that when she is gone, there will no longer be any trace that Sabina ever existed.
    To her this story shows that it is pointless to make plans. I do not agree. I
    believe it is important to plan, if we do so with our eyes open. But more important,
    my mother’s experience has taught me that we ought to identify and appreciate
    the good luck that we have and recognize the random events that contribute to
    our success. It has taught me, too, to accept the chance events that may cause
    us grief. Most of all it has taught me to appreciate the absence of bad luck,
    the absence of events that might have brought us down, and the absence of the
    disease, war, famine, and accident that have not—or have not yet—befallen us.
