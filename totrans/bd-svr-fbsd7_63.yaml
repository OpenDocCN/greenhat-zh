- en: SpamAssassin is a highly effective open source email classifier. It is designed
    to examine email using a diverse set of tests to determine if a message is spam.
    Messages are scored using keywords, historical data (e.g., Bayesian filtering),
    and fingerprinting methods (e.g., Vipul's Razor and DCC databases) to maximize
    effectiveness by leveraging the benefits of each type of test. SpamAssassin stores
    the results of these tests in each email's header. Mail Delivery Agents (MDA)
    like Procmail (see "[Procmail 3.22](procmail_3.22.html#procmail_3.22)") can use
    these headers to route or perform further processing of the message.

- en: Typically, SpamAssassin is invoked as a daemon or background process. A mail
    transfer agent like Postfix is configured to pipe email through SpamAssassin for
    analysis. If a message is determined to be spam, SpamAssassin can be configured
    to modify the message in a number of ways. By default, spam is re-encoded as an
    attachment and the body of the message displays the list of tests that triggered
    the positive result. Spam and ham (legitimate email) are then delivered to users'
    mailboxes.

- en: SpamAssassin was written in 2001 by Justin Mason, an Irish software developer.
    It is based on filter.plx, a spam filter written in Perl by Mark Jeftovic in 1997\.
    Justin contributed patches to Jeftovic's filter.plx and later decided to rewrite
    the code (also in Perl) from scratch. This recode became SpamAssassin and is now
    a project of the Apache Software Foundation. Mason currently directs SpamAssassin
    development as a vice president of the Apache Software Foundation.
