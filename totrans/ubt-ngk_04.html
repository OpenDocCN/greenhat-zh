Even if you're not much of a surfer, there are still numerous other applications that aren't really Internet applications per se but that still use the Internet in some way, such as gathering song and album information when you rip audio CDs to create MP3 files. Having a computer that isn't hooked up to the Internet is like buying a new Maserati and then refusing to take it out of the garage.</p><p>Of course, how you connect to the Internet depends on your hardware and provider. There are a number of possibilities in this area, including high-speed local area networks (LANs), cable modems, mobile (3G) broadband, and ADSL connections from phone companies. Some computers still have an internal 56Kbps modem or can be connected to external dial-up modems for slower connections over regular phone lines. Depending on what you have, setting things up on your system should prove a cinch in the case of LAN connections and any others that use your Ethernet port (such as cable modems), possibly a bit more work in the case of wireless and mobile connections, and sometimes a bit of a challenge when it comes to dial-up connections. In this chapter you will learn how to set up these connections, and in the next chapter you will learn a bit about what Linux has to offer in terms of the most commonly used Internet applications.</p><div class="sect1" title="How Do You Connect?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_do_you_connect_question"/>How Do You Connect?</h1></div></div></div><p>The way you go about setting up your connection really depends on how you're trying to connect to the Internet.

I'm going to assume that you've already set up your router or modem according to your Internet provider's instructions, so all that remains is to connect an Ethernet cable between the modem/router (or LAN wall socket) and your computer's network socket.

If that doesn't work, try restarting your machine while physically connected to your Internet source with the Ethernet cable. If the lack of connectivity persists, it is possible that your network card is not supported by Linux. This is relatively rare but, fortunately, easily remedied (by replacing it).</p><p>The problem could also be that your network or service provider does not automatically assign addresses via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). <span class="emphasis"><em>DHCP</em></span> is a means by which your Internet provider can automatically provide your system with the configuration information it needs in order to connect to the Internet.

To get started, you need to have the right hardware. If you just want to go wireless, then all you need is a wireless network card (sometimes referred to as an <span class="emphasis"><em>802.11a/b/g/n card</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>WiFi card</em></span>). These are built in to almost all modern laptops, while for older models they are usually add-ons in the form of cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot on the side of your computer (as shown on the right of <a class="xref" href="ch04s04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wifi_setupman_access" title="Figure 4-3. All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card">Figure 4-3</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="all_you_need_for_a_wifi_setupman_access"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3985"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656176.png.jpg" alt="All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-3. All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card</p></div><p>Some wireless cards plug into one of your machine's USB ports or, in the case of desktop models, one of its PCI slots. Although support for cards of this type has improved through the past couple of years, there are still gaps, and some can be rather tricky to deal with. You'll find some tips on how to deal with awkward cards in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. WOUNDED WINGS">Chapter 21</a>, but if you're looking for a sure thing, Centrino IPW-2100 and IPW-2200 cards are definitely supported by Ubuntu. As for cards of the built-in or PC card variety, you will find support much better, but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the card you are using is Linux compatible. No matter what wireless card you are wondering about, the easiest way to find out whether it will work is to just try it. The Linux kernel now comes with many wireless drivers built in, and Ubuntu updates often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things don't seem to work, check Ubuntu's list of supported cards (<a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/</a>), or check the Ubuntu forums to find a driver that is compatible or to see whether anyone has experience with your particular card.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0262" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you want to set up a wireless system in your home or office, then you will also need to get a <span class="emphasis"><em>wireless access point</em></span> (WAP), shown on the left of <a class="xref" href="ch04s04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wifi_setupman_access" title="Figure 4-3. All you need for a WiFi setup—an access point and a network interface card">Figure 4-3</a>. Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not really much of an issue in this department, because the access point doesn't physically interface with your computer, and the settings are handled via your web browser.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Access points come in several different types. The most common type is a wireless router, which many ISPs provide for free.</p></div><p>You should be aware, however, that a few access points require you to use Internet Explorer to handle their setup chores. Although it is possible to get Internet Explorer up and running in Linux via Wine (as you'll see in <a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. PENGUINS AT THE GATES">Chapter 18</a>), you can't be 100 percent sure that it will work. Unless you have a Windows machine somewhere in your house or office to handle such chores, it is probably a good idea to steer clear of access points of this kind.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0263" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Activating Your Wireless Card"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="activating_your_wireless_card"/>Activating Your Wireless Card</h2></div></div></div><p>Setting up a Linux-compatible wireless PC card is actually relatively simple. First connect your access point to your Internet source, and then turn on the access point. Once it is up and running, plug your wireless card into the PCMCIA slot or USB port on your laptop (unless your wireless connection is built in, in which case you can forgo this step). Any LEDs on the external card will most likely light up at this time.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0264" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0265" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0266" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0267" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0268" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0269" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0270" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0271" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If your access point was on when you booted up your computer and your wireless card was in place during bootup, you probably don't need to do much else to access the Internet. Just follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Click the Network Manager icon on the top panel to reveal a drop-down menu showing the wireless signals that are present in your vicinity and the strength of each signal (<a class="xref" href="ch04s04.html#the_network_manager_shows_you_available" title="Figure 4-4. The Network Manager shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths.">Figure 4-4</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From that menu, select the signal for your access point (or any other wave you are entitled to latch onto) by clicking it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Your system will then try to connect to the Internet.

If you didn't choose your own password when you set up the access point, try looking for a sticker on the base or side of the access point to see whether a default one is used. If you're trying to connect to a network for which you don't happen to know the key, then chances are you are not supposed to be making the connection in the first place. Naughty, naughty.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0272" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0273" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0274" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="figure"><a id="the_network_manager_shows_you_available"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e4107"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656178.png.jpg" alt="The Network Manager shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-4. The Network Manager shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths.</p></div><p>If you were not successful in making your wireless connection (the system will tell you whether that's the case), you have a few possibilities beyond the annoying noncompatible-card scenario. First, double-check to make sure your card is actually physically turned on. I know that sounds dumb, but I have been guilty of this oversight myself on numerous occasions. Many laptops have a key you can press to enable or disable the wireless card; on mine you have to press the function key (fn) and F2 at the same time.</p><p>Another, less common, possibility is that your network does not use DHCP, in which case you will have to manually input your connection settings as provided by your network administrator or service provider.

You'll be disconnected and then automatically reconnected.</p><p>If that doesn't work, try disabling and then enabling the wireless connection using Network Manager's Enable Wireless option, as described earlier. If you still have no luck, try turning the wireless card off and on again using a switch or button if you have one, or unplug it and plug it back in again.

My advice is to hold off on the wondering and worrying and just give your modem a try to see whether it works. If it does, then you're all set. If it doesn't, well, then you do have some options, and at least you haven't done any damage to your system.</p><p>With all that intro-babble out of the way, let's get down to the steps for setting up your dial-up connection. First, get the settings information you need from your Internet provider. Most providers aim their operations at Windows and often Mac users, and very few offer Linux support. Still, there is no technical reason for your Linux system not to work via their setup, so just nag and push them until they give you the information you want. After that, make sure your modem is connected to a live telephone connection—for example, the phone jack in your wall.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0292" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0293" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Now it's time to set up the connection. I'll use the GNOME PPP program to do all of the setting up here, but there's a caveat: It's not installed by default, and you need an Internet connection to install it! If you have access to some other Internet connection that you can use temporarily, connect to that, and use the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install GNOME PPP (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a> to learn how to install software). The alternative is to use the <code class="literal">pppconfig</code> command, which is installed by default but is difficult to use. Find another computer and check out <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/SetUpDialer/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/SetUpDialer/</a> for instructions if you have no alternative but to use <code class="literal">pppconfig</code>.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0294" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Assuming that you got GNOME PPP installed using a borrowed Internet connection, you can follow these steps to set up your modem:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Internet</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>GNOME PPP</strong></span>, after which GNOME PPP will appear.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span>, and make sure you're looking at the <span class="strong"><strong>Modem</strong></span> tab.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Detect</strong></span> button to identify your modem.

You should then hear your modem begin its dialing, spitting, and churning sequence as it makes the connection with your provider.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you manage to get connected, you can start your browsing, emailing, or whatever else it is you do online.

What happens, however, if your modem and Ubuntu do not see eye to eye? Well, there are a few options. My first, more radical suggestion, is to dump your dial-up ISP and find a broadband provider that covers your local area. If that is not an option, then you have two ways to go. One is to try to geek around with your modem to see whether you can get it to work. This is a slightly more complicated process, but there are instructions at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto</a>. If you are faint of heart or a novice user, you may find what the process entails to be a bit more than you're willing to deal with.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0295" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0296" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0297" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0298" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0299" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0300" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The simpler, although costlier, way to get your modem to work is to purchase a true hardware modem. <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware modems</em></span> are not software dependent, so they work with any operating system. You can think of them as telephones without a handset.</p><p>Such modems come in two forms: internal and external. As for the internals, the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal slot) and 56 PC Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true hardware modems that are easily available and are said to work. You can check out the USRobotics site (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.usr.com/">http://www.usr.com/</a>) for more information on these models, though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions is always a good idea. Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an external dial-up modem. They come with either serial or USB connectors and sit in a box outside your computer. Because the modem doesn't use your operating system to operate, it does not tie up system resources while it's busy, which may result in a possible pickup in computer speed.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0301" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0302" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0303" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Linux support for USB modems can be patchy, so do your research before buying one. External serial modems are a safer bet since most of them should work with your system . . . if you have a serial port, that is. Modern computers rarely have them any more, so check to see whether you have one by looking at the back of your computer for a connector with little prongs in it (see <a class="xref" href="ch04s06.html#serial_port_and_connector" title="Figure 4-5. Serial port and connector">Figure 4-5</a>). If you are worried and are looking for a sure thing, Zoom Telephonics (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zoom.com/">http://www.zoom.com/</a>) makes an external serial modem that is compatible with Linux, and the company says so right on its website. The USRobotics 56K V.92 External Faxmodem is also said to work, though I haven't tried this model myself.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0304" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0305" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0306" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0307" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="serial_port_and_connector"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e4455"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656180.png.jpg" alt="Serial port and connector"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-5. Serial port and connector</p></div><p>If you find another model that you think will do the trick, before you commit to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search with that modem's make and model number, along with the word <span class="emphasis"><em>linux</em></span>, and see what search results you get. Of course, you can also try one of the Linux forums and ask about the modem make and model there. A lot of people are in the same boat, so you are sure to get plenty of opinions and advice.</p></div></div>
