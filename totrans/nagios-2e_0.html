    </div>

    <p>It's ten o'clock on Monday morning. The boss of the branch office is in a rage. He's been waiting for hours for an important e-mail, and it still hasn't arrived. It can only be the fault of the mail server; it's probably misbehaving yet again. But a quick check of the computer shows that no mails have got stuck in the queue there, and there's no mention either in the log file that a mail from the sender in question has arrived. So where's the problem?</p>

    <p>The central mail server of the company doesn't respond to a <strong class="userinput"><code>ping</code></strong>. That's probably the root of the problem. But the IT department at the company head office absolutely insists that it is not to blame. It also cannot ping the mail node of the branch office, but it maintains that the network at the head office is running smoothly, so the problem must lie with the network at the branch office. The search for the error continues...</p>

    <p>The humiliating result: the VPN connection to head office was down, and although the ISDN backup connection was working, no route to the head office (and thus to the central mail server) was defined in the backup router. A globally operating IT service provider was responsible for the network connections (VPN and ISDN) between branch and head office, for whom something like this "just doesn't happen." The end result: many hours spent searching for the error, an irritated boss (the meeting for which the e-mail was urgently required has long since finished), and a sweating admin.</p>

    <p>With a properly configured Nagios system, the adminstrator would already have noticed the problem at eight in the morning and been able to isolate its cause within a few minutes. Instead of losing valuable time, the IT service provider would have been informed directly. The time then required to eliminate the error (in this case, half an hour) would have been sufficient to deliver the e-mail in time.</p>

    <p>A second example: somewhere in Germany, the hard drive on which the central Oracle database for a hospital stores its log files reaches full capacity Although this does not cause the "lights to go out" in the operating room, the database stops working and there is considerable disruption to work procedures: patients cannot be admitted, examination results cannot be saved, and reports cannot be documented until the problem has been fixed.</p>

    <p>If the critical hard drive had been monitored with Nagios, the IT department would have been warned at an early stage. The problem would not even have occurred.</p>

    <p>With personnel resources becoming more and more scarce, no IT department can really afford to regularly check all systems manually. Networks that are growing more and more complex especially demand the need to be informed early on of disruptions that have occurred or of problems that are about to happen. Nagios, the Open Source tool for system and network monitoring, helps the administrator to detect problems before the phone rings off the hook.</p>

    <p>The aim of the software is to inform administrators quickly about questionable (WARNING) or critical conditions (CRITICAL). What is regarded as "questionable" or "critical" is defined by the administrator in the configuration. A Web page summary then informs the administrator of normally working systems and services, which Nagios displays in green, of questionable conditions (yellow), and of critical situations (red). There is also the possibility of informing the administrators in charge—depending on specific services or systems—selectively by e-mail but also by paging services such as SMS.</p>

    <p>By concentrating on stop light states (green, yellow, red), Nagios is distinct from network tools that display elapsed time graphically (for example in the load of a WAN interface or a CPU throughout an entire day) or that record and measure network traffic (how high was the proportion of HTTP on a particular interface?). Nagios is involved plainly and simply with the issue of whether everything is on a green light. The software does an excellent job in looking after this, not just in terms of the current status but also over long periods of time.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0001"/></p>

    <div class="sect1" title="The tests">
      <div class="titlepage">
        <h1 class="title" id="heading_id_3"><a id="the_tests"/>The tests</h1>
      </div>

      <p>When checking critical hosts and services, Nagios distinguishes between host and service checks. A <span class="emphasis"><em>host check</em></span> tests a computer, called a <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span> in Nagios slang, for reachability—as a rule, a simple <strong class="userinput"><code>ping</code></strong> is used. A <span class="emphasis"><em>service check</em></span> selectively tests individual network services such as HTTP, SMTP, DNS, etc., but also running processes, CPU load, or log files. Host checks are performed by Nagios irregularly and only where required, for example if none of the services to be monitored can be reached on the host being monitored. As long as one service can be addressed there, then this is basically valid for the entire computer, so this test can be dropped.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0010"/></p>

      <p>The simplest test for network services consists of looking to see whether the relevant target port is open, and whether a service is listening there. But this does not necessarily mean that, for example, the SSH daemon really is running on TCP port 22. Nagios therefore uses tests for many services that go several steps further. With SMTP, for example, the software also tests whether the mail server announces itself with a "220" output, the so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>SMTP greeting</em></span>; and for a PostgreSQL database, it checks whether this will accept an SQL query.</p>

      <p>Nagios becomes especially interesting through the fact that it takes into account dependencies in the network topology (if it is configured to do so). If the target system can only be reached through a particular router that has just gone down, then Nagios reports that the target system is "unreachable" and does not bother to bombard it with further host and service checks. The software puts administrators in a position where they can more quickly detect the actual cause and rectify the situation.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The great strength of Nagios—even in comparison with other network monitoring tools—lies in its modular structure. The Nagios core does not contain one single test. Instead it uses external programs for service and host checks, which are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>plugins</em></span>. The basic equipment already contains a number of standard plugins for the most important application cases. Special requests that go beyond these are answered—provided that you have basic programming knowledge—by plugins that you can write yourself. Before investing time in developing these, however, it is first worth taking a look on the Internet and browsing through the relevant mailing lists,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-2" id="PREFACE-FN-2">2</a>]</sup> as there is lively activity in this area. Ready-to-use plugins are available, especially in The Nagios Exchange platform, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nagiosexchange.org/">http://www.nagiosexchange.org/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0022"/></p>

    <p>A plugin is a simple program—often just a shell script (Bash, Perl, etc.)—that gives out one of the four possible conditions: OK, WARNING, CRITICAL, or (with operating errors, for example) UNKNOWN.</p>

    <p>This means that in principle Nagios can test everything that can be measured or counted electronically: the temperature and humidity in the server room, the amount of rainfall, the presence of persons in a certain room at a time when nobody should enter it. There are no limits to this, provided that you can find a way of providing measurement data or events as information that can be evaluated by computer (for example, with a temperature and humidity sensor, an infrared sensor, etc.). Apart from the standard plugins, this book accordingly introduces further freely available plugins, such as the use of a plugin to query a temperature and humidity sensor in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. Monitoring Room Temperature and Humidity">Chapter 21</a> from page 505.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Nagios possesses a sophisticated notification system. On the sender side (that is, with the host or service check) you can configure when each group of persons—the so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>contact groups</em></span>—are informed about which conditions or events (failure, recovery, warnings, etc.). On the receiver side you can also define on multiple levels what is to be done with a corresponding message—for example whether the system should forward it, depending on the time of day, or discard the message.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0024"/></p>

    <p>If a specific service is to be monitored seven days a week round the clock, this does not mean that the administrator in charge will never be able to take a break. For example, you can instruct Nagios to notify the person only from Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm, every two hours at the most. If the administrator in charge is not able to solve the problem within a specified period of time, eight hours for example, then the head of department responsible should receive a message. This process is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation management</em></span>. The corresponding configuration is explained in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. The Nagios Notification System">Chapter 12</a> from page 282.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0025"/></p>

    <p>Nagios can also make use of freely configurable, external programs for notifications, so that you can integrate any system you like, from e-mail to SMS, to a voice server that the administrator calls up and receives a voice message concerning the error.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0026"/></p>

    <p>With its Web interface (<a class="xref" href="../Text/ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. The Classical Web Interface">Chapter 16</a> from page 327, Nagios provides the administrator with a wide range of information, clearly arranged according to the issues involved. Whether the admin needs a summary of the overall situation, a display of problematic services and hosts and the causes of network outages, or the status of entire groups of hosts or services, Nagios provides an individually structured information page for nearly every purpose.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0027"/></p>

    <p>Through the Web front end, an administrator can inform colleagues upon accepting a particular problem so that they can concentrate on other issues that have not yet been addressed. Information already obtained can be stored as comments on hosts and services.</p>

    <p>By reviewing past events, the Web interface can reveal problems that occurred in a selected time interval, who was informed of the problems, and which hosts and/or services were affected. Nagios can be configured to recognize scheduled downtimes and to prevent false alarms from going off during these periods.</p>
  </div>

      <h1 class="title" id="heading_id_2"><a id="taking_in_information_from_outside"/>Taking in information from outside</h1>
    </div>

    <p>For tests, notifications, and so on, Nagios makes use of external programs, but the reverse is also possible: through a separate interface (see <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch13.html#the_interface_for_external_commands" title="13.1 The Interface for External Commands">13.1 The Interface for External Commands</a> from page 292), independent programs can send status information and commands to Nagios. The Web interface makes widespread use of this possibility, which allows the administrator to send interactive commands to Nagios. But a backup program unknown to Nagios can also transmit a success or failure to Nagios, as well as to a syslog daemon. The possibilities are limitless. Thanks to this interface, Nagios allows distributed monitoring. This involves several decentralized Nagios installations sending their test results to a central instance, which then helps to maintain an overview of the situation from a central location.</p>

    <div class="titlepage">
      <h1 class="title" id="heading_id_2"><a id="other_tools_for_network_monitoring"/>Other tools for network monitoring</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Nagios is not the only tool for monitoring systems and networks. The most well-known "competitor," perhaps on an equal footing, is <span class="emphasis"><em>Big Brother</em></span> (BB). Despite a number of differences, its Web interface serves the same purpose as that of Nagios: displaying to the administrator what is in the "green area" and what is not.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0029"/></p>

    <p>The reason why the author uses Nagios instead of Big Brother lies in the license for Big Brother, on the BB homepage<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-3" id="PREFACE-FN-3">3</a>]</sup> called <span class="emphasis"><em>Better Than Free License</em></span>: the product continues to be commercially developed and distributed. If you use BB and earn money with it, you must buy the software. The fact that the software, including the source code, may not be passed on or modified, except with the explicit permission of the vendor, means that it cannot be reconciled with the criteria for Open Source licenses. This means that Linux distributors have their hands tied.</p>

    <p>For the graphical display of certain measured values over a period of time, such as the load on a network interface, CPU load, or the number of mails per minute, there are other tools that perform this task better than Nagios. The original tool is certainly the <span class="emphasis"><em>Multi Router Traffic Grapher</em></span> MRTG,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-4" id="PREFACE-FN-4">4</a>]</sup> which, despite growing competition, still enjoys great popularity. A relatively young, but very powerful alternative is called Cacti<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-5" id="PREFACE-FN-5">5</a>]</sup>: this has a larger range of applications, can be configured via Web interface, and avoids the restrictions in MRTG, which can only display two measured values at the same time and cannot display any negative values. Another interesting new alternative is Munin.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-6" id="PREFACE-FN-6">6</a>]</sup><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0032"/></p>

    <p>Nagios itself can also display performance data graphically, using extensions (<a class="xref" href="../Text/ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Graphic Display of Performance Data">Chapter 19</a> from page 403). In many cases this is sufficient, but for very dedicated requirements, the use of Nagios in tandem with a graphic representation tool such as MRTG or Cacti is recommended.</p>

    <div class="titlepage">
      <h1 class="title" id="heading_id_2"><a id="about_this_book"/>About This Book</h1>
    </div>

    <p>This book is directed at network administrators who want to find out about the condition of their systems and networks using an Open Source tool. It describes the Nagios versions 2.x and 3.0. The plugins, on the other hand, lead their own lives, are to a great extent independent of Nagios, and are therefore not restricted to a particular version.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0033"/></p>

    <p>Even though this book is based upon using Linux as the operating system for the Nagios computer, this is not a requirement. Most descriptions also apply to other Unix systems,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-7" id="PREFACE-FN-7">7</a>]</sup> only system-specific details such as start scripts need to be adjusted accordingly. Nagios currently does not officially work under Windows, however.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.PREFACE-FN-8" id="PREFACE-FN-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

    <p>The first part of this book deals with getting Nagios up and running with a simple configuration, albeit one that is sufficient for many uses, as quickly as possible. This is why <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installation">Chapter 1</a> through <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Startup">Chapter 3</a> do not have detailed descriptions and treatments of all options and features. These are examined in the second part of the book.</p>

    <p><a class="xref" href="../Text/ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Nagios Basics">Chapter 4</a> looks at the details of service and host checks, and in particular introduces their dependency on network topologies.</p>

    <p>The options available to Nagios for implementing service checks and obtaining their results is described in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Service Checks and How They Are Performed">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

    <p>This is followed by the presentation of individual standard plugins and a number of additional, freely obtainable plugins. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Plugins for Network Services">Chapter 6</a> takes a look at the plugins that inspect the services of a network protocol directly from the Nagios host, while <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Testing Local Resources">Chapter 7</a> summarizes plugins that need to be installed on the machine that is being monitored, and for which Nagios needs additional utilities to get them running. Several auxiliary plugins, which do not perform any tests themselves, but manipulate already established results, are introduced in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Plugins for Special Tasks">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

    <p>Two utilities that Nagios requires to run local plugins on remote hosts are introduced in the two subsequent chapters. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Executing Plugins via SSH">Chapter 9</a> describes SSH, while <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. The Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE)">Chapter 10</a> introduces a daemon developed specifically for Nagios.</p>

    <p>Wherever networks are being monitored, SNMP also needs to be implemented. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Collecting Information Relevant for Monitoring with SNMP">Chapter 11</a> not only describes SNMP-capable plugins but also examines the protocol and the SNMP world itself in detail, providing the background knowledge needed for this.</p>

    <p>The Nagios notification system is introduced <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. The Nagios Notification System">Chapter 12</a>, which also deals with notification using SMS, escalation management, and taking account of dependencies.</p>

    <p>The interface for external commands is discussed in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Passive Tests with the External Command File">Chapter 13</a>. This forms the basis of other Nagios mechanisms, such as the Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA), a client-server mechanism for transmitting passive test results, covered in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. The Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA)">Chapter 14</a>. The use of this is shown in two concrete examples—integrating <strong class="userinput"><code>syslog-ng</code></strong> and processing SNMP traps. NSCA is also a requirement for distributed monitoring, discussed in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Distributed Monitoring">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

    <p>The third part of the book is devoted to how the extracted information can be represented graphically. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. The Classical Web Interface">Chapter 16</a> explains how this works and how it is set up in detail, supported by some useful screenshots. It also explains a series of parameters, for which there are otherwise no documentation at all, except in the source code.</p>

    <p>Nagios can be expanded by adding external applications. The NDOUtils enable database-driven storage of all Nagios objects and are described in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Flexible Web Interface with the NDOUtils">Chapter 17</a>. Connection to a database, using the addon described in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. NagVis">Chapter 18</a>, enables you to build a Web interface that can be configured far beyond the basic range of Nagios.</p>

    <p>Although in its operation, Nagios concentrates primarily on stoplight signals (red-yellow-green), there are ways of evaluating and representing the performance data provided by plugins, which are described in detail in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Graphic Display of Performance Data">Chapter 19</a>.</p>

    <p>The fourth part of this book is dedicated to special applications. Networks are rarely homogeneous—that is, equipped only with Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. For this reason, <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch20.html" title="Chapter 20. Monitoring Windows Servers">Chapter 20</a> demonstrates what utilities can be used to integrate and monitor Windows systems.</p>

    <p><a class="xref" href="../Text/ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. Monitoring Room Temperature and Humidity">Chapter 21</a> uses the example of a low-cost hardware sensor to show how room temperature and humidity can be monitored simply, yet effectively.</p>

    <p>Nagios can also monitor proprietary commercial software, as long as mechanisms are available which can query states of the system integrated into a plugin. In <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Monitoring SAP Systems">Chapter 22</a>, this is described using an SAP-R/3 system.</p>

    <p>Whereas event processing is only briefly outlined in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. The Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA)">Chapter 14</a>, <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch23.html" title="Chapter 23. Processing Events with the EventDB">Chapter 23</a> presents a database-supported approach that provides more options for selecting and processing events, including interlinking with Nagios.</p>

    <p>Building your own plugins is the subject of the fifth part of this book. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch24.html" title="Chapter 24. Writing Your Own Plugins">Chapter 24</a> looks at the general requirements for a standard plugin, while <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch25.html" title="Chapter 25. Determining File and Directory Sizes">Chapter 25</a> uses a step-by-step example of how to write your own plugins that are fit for publishing. <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch26.html" title="Chapter 26. Monitoring Oracle with the Instant Client">Chapter 26</a> takes an example of the Instant Client of Oracle to demonstrate how to build your own plugins based on programs not really intended for this purpose.</p>

    <p><a class="xref" href="../Text/apa.html" title="Appendix A. An Overview of the Nagios Configuration Parameters">Appendix A</a> introduces all the parameters of the two central configuration files <strong class="userinput"><code>nagios.cfg</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>cgi.cfg</code></strong>, while <a class="xref" href="../Text/apb.html" title="Appendix B. Rapidly Alternating States: Flapping">Appendix B</a> and <a class="xref" href="../Text/apc.html" title="Appendix C. Event Handlers">Appendix C</a> are devoted to some useful but somewhat exotic features.</p>

    <p>A separate appendix (<a class="xref" href="../Text/apd.html" title="Appendix D. Macros">Appendix D</a>) is devoted to <span class="emphasis"><em>macros</em></span>, which allow flexibility in configuration.</p>

    <p><a class="xref" href="../Text/ape.html" title="Appendix E. Single Sign-On for the Nagios Web Interface">Appendix E</a> wanders slightly away from the core topic of Nagios and demonstrates how single sign-on scenarios can also be used for authentication in the Nagios Web interface.</p>

    <p>The larger the environment, the more important it is to have a powerful and quick-reacting Nagios system. <a class="xref" href="../Text/apf.html" title="Appendix F. Tips on Optimizing Performance">Appendix F</a> offers a series suggestions on this, while <a class="xref" href="../Text/apg.html" title="Appendix G. The Embedded Perl Interpreter">Appendix G</a> is dedicated to a specific tool, the Perl interpreter integrated into Nagios.</p>

    <p>Finally, <a class="xref" href="../Text/aph.html" title="Appendix H. What's New in Nagios 3.0?">Appendix H</a> briefly summarizes all the changes made since Nagios 2.x</p>

My thanks go first of all to Dr. Markus Wirtz, who initiated this book with his comment, "Why don't you write a Nagios book, then?!", when he refused to accept my Nagios activities as an excuse for delays in writing another book. A very special thanks goes to Patricia Jung, who, as the technical editor for the German language version, overhauled the manuscript and pestered me with thousands of questions—which was a good thing for the completeness of the book, and which has ultimately made it easier for the reader to understand.</p>

    <p>The book would not be possible, of course, without all the tools it describes. Very special thanks go to Ethan Galstad, who as author, developer and maintainer has made Nagios what it is today: an awesome, incredibly useful and helpful tool that also fulfills high-level requirements, and one that can rely on a very large—and above all very active— community. Also many thanks to Ton Voon, representing all members of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Nagios Plugins Development Team</em></span>, who, together with his colleagues, manages the development of Nagios plugins.</p>

    <p>My thanks also go to those who have not only developed the Nagios-related software introduced in this book, but have also helped to polish and improve the book with their proofreading and feedback: Matthias Flacke (of <strong class="userinput"><code>check_multi</code></strong> fame), Jörg Linge (PNP), and Steffen Waitz, who proofread the first edition, Hendrik Bäcker (<strong class="userinput"><code>npcd</code></strong>), Lars Michelsen, Michael Luebben (NagVis), Gerhard Laußer (<strong class="userinput"><code>check_logfiles</code></strong>), and the employees of NETWAYS GmbH (NagiosGrapher, EventDB, the exchange platform, NagiosExchange).</p>

    <p>It is not possible for me to name all the individuals who have contributed in one way or another to the success of Nagios. I would therefore like to thank everybody who actively supports the Nagios community, whether this is through free software or through involvement in forums and mailing lists. Where would Nagios be without its users?</p>
