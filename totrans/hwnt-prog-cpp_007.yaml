- en: Every novice programmer starts out learning about simple expressions and how
    to print them. But the following program is a little too simple. What's the problem?

- en: One clever programmer came up with a way of robbing a bank. He stole about 1/2¢
    from every depositor. When banks compound interest the result is not always a
    whole number. For example, the interest might 3.2¢ or 8.6¢. Banks routinely round
    this number, so 3.2 becomes 3 and 8.6 becomes 9\. The result is that about half
    the time, the number is rounded up and the other half it's rounded down. So everything
    comes out roughly even.

- en: A crooked programmer changed the algorithm to always truncate. Thus 3.2 becomes
    3 and 8.6 becomes 8\. This leaves a lot of fractions of cents floating around.
    The programmer collected these and added them to the last name in the list of
    accounts. Since he had opened an account in the name of ZZYMOCK, that account
    was his.

    one noticed. After all, how many people check their interest down to the last
    decimal point? How many people even check their interest at all?

- en: But the fellow was caught. Seems that ZZYSKI opened up an account. Now his name
    was last on the list. And when he got his first statement he was rather surprised
    to learn that he was getting $38,238.83 in interest on a $200 account.
