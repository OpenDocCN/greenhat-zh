    all aspects of Wikipedia.

- en: 'Part I looks at Wikipedia from the reader''s point of view. [Chapter 1](hw-wkpd-wk_02.html
    "Chapter 1. What''s in Wikipedia?") describes the type of content Wikipedia contains
    and the basic policies that determine what content is included. The site''s history
    is explored in [Chapter 2](hw-wkpd-wk_03.html "Chapter 2. The World Gets a Free
    Encyclopedia"); in particular, we look at the way that Wikipedia unites three
    historical strands: encyclopedias, wikis, and free software. How to search and
    browse the site (including an explanation of the sidebar and main page) is detailed
    in [Chapter 3](hw-wkpd-wk_04.html "Chapter 3. Finding Wikipedia''s Content"),
    and [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html "Chapter 4. Understanding and Evaluating an
    Article") covers the structure of an individual article and methods for evaluating
    article quality.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part II turns to editing the site. A basic explanation of how to edit a page
    and an introduction to *wikisyntax* are in [Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html "Chapter 5. Basic
    Editing"); this chapter forms the foundation for the next chapters in this part.
    [Chapter 6](hw-wkpd-wk_08.html "Chapter 6. Good Writing and Research") covers
    how to start a new article and explores encyclopedic writing, research, and collaboration
    techniques that are useful for working on any article. Formal processes for maintaining
    content, including collaborative editing drives and cleanup projects, WikiProjects,
    and article deletion and promotion processes are covered in [Chapter 7](hw-wkpd-wk_09.html
    "Chapter 7. Cleanup, Projects, and Processes"). [Chapter 8](hw-wkpd-wk_10.html
    "Chapter 8. Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web") explains how articles are linked together
    through Wikipedia's category structure, disambiguation pages, and redirects, along
    with how pages are maintained through merging, splitting, and moving. More advanced
    syntax, including image formatting, tables, templates, and special characters,
    is covered in [Chapter 9](hw-wkpd-wk_11.html "Chapter 9. Images, Templates, and
    Special Characters"). [Chapter 10](hw-wkpd-wk_12.html "Chapter 10. The Life Cycle
    of an Article") steps through the life cycle of a newly created article.

- en: Part III covers Wikipedia's elaborate social side. We begin with how to sign
    up as an editor, including setting up an account, setting preferences, and using
    your personal user and talk pages in [Chapter 11](hw-wkpd-wk_14.html "Chapter 11. Becoming
    a Wikipedian"), in which we also describe Wikipedia's administrator system. Wikipedia's
    culture and the ways editors communicate (including a list of forums for asking
    questions and discussing problems) are covered in [Chapter 12](hw-wkpd-wk_15.html
    "Chapter 12. Community and Communication"), and the policies that govern Wikipedia
    and how these policies are created are described in [Chapter 13](hw-wkpd-wk_16.html
    "Chapter 13. Policy and Your Input"). Finally, [Chapter 14](hw-wkpd-wk_17.html
    "Chapter 14. Disputes, Blocks, and Bans") discusses how the dispute resolution
    process works—and how to avoid disagreement in the first place.

- en: Part IV steps back from the English-language Wikipedia to cover other Wikimedia
    Foundation projects, including editions of Wikipedia in other languages in [Chapter 15](hw-wkpd-wk_19.html
    "Chapter 15. 200 Languages and Counting") and Wikipedia's sister projects, including
    Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikispecies,
    and Wikiversity, in [Chapter 16](hw-wkpd-wk_20.html "Chapter 16. Wikimedia Commons
    and Other Sister Projects"). Finally, we cover the Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia's
    parent organization) and how work at the Foundation level is coordinated in [Chapter 17](hw-wkpd-wk_21.html
    "Chapter 17. The Foundation and Project Coordination").

    book is licensed, is included starting on [PREAMBLE](hw-wkpd-wk_27.html#preamble

    setup, on its constitutional and policy side, seems to be relatively settled and
    understood across the editing community; and after seven years of existence, Wikipedia
    has a certain maturity. We have tried to be as accurate as possible at the moment
