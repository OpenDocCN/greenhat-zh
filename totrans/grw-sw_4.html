      development processes, and quality are significant topics—and many books
      have been written about each. This section cannot provide a complete
      discussion of each topic, but it does offer an introduction to each,
      with an emphasis on applications for small software companies. If you

<div class="chapter" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_estimating"/>Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING</h1></div></div></div><p>As soon as someone asks "How long will the project take, and how
      many staff hours are required?", your reputation as development manager
      is on the line. You could <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0668"/>offer up a quick estimate that gets the task off of your
      to-do list, or you could take the time to create a thoughtful project
      estimate and be confident that you can actually make it happen.</p><p>Winging it by providing a quick estimate might be the fastest way
      to provide an answer, but it's also an easy way to "get fried." And
      after being cooked a few times over poor estimates, most development
      managers start looking for a better estimating recipe.</p><p>For new managers, the best estimating method isn't always obvious.
      At the extreme end of the spectrum, you can't make an estimate until a
      complete definition <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0669"/>of the effort has been proposed and analyzed.
      Unfortunately, this is not always practical for small companies whose
      approaches must be systematic, simple, and relatively
      straightforward.</p><p>This chapter covers the process of estimating a single project and
      creating a model to help you improve future estimates. Estimating models
      can take some effort to set up, but they can be very effective in
      helping you improve both the speed and quality of your estimates.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="building_an_estimate"/>Building an Estimate</h1></div></div></div><p>Building a good estimate is a skill and an art that requires
        following a reasoned process and using your experience—even
        intuition—to make adjustments. You will rarely have the exact
        information you need to create a highly accurate estimate for a
        project. Part of improving your estimating skills is realizing that
        you will be making many assumptions and guesses, some of which will be
        wrong. You will succeed when your assumptions and guesses are mostly
        right and when you can successfully split the larger processes into
        smaller pieces to estimate.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0670"/></p><p>When crafting an estimate, do it in a systematic way. Start by
        defining what data you need to collect and how you need to assemble it
        into the estimate. Then collect the data for your estimate: This will
        require that you dig through past estimates and data and discuss the
        project and its requirements with others. Finally, you'll construct
        the estimate by assembling the pieces of data into a coherent picture
        that lets you determine the amount of time and effort required to
        finish the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0671"/>work.</p><p>When you have completed your estimate, you'll need to deliver
        it. Your method of delivery can have a large impact on the project's
        success. Let's consider estimating and delivery in more detail
        first.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_a_task_list"/>Creating a Task List</h2></div></div></div><p>How you build the estimate depends on the project complexity.
          A simple project estimate might comprise a short series of steps
          with an estimated <span class="emphasis"><em>cost in effort</em></span> and
          <span class="emphasis"><em>cost in calendar days. Cost in effort</em></span> refers to
          the time required to complete a task, assuming the worker is
          devoting all of his time to the task. This is often captured in
          hours or days of work. <span class="emphasis"><em>Cost in calendar time</em></span>
          refers to the time required to complete a task, assuming the
          employee won't be able to devote all of his time to the task because
          of overhead tasks, company meetings, vacations, and sometimes other
          projects. This is <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0672"/>often recorded in <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0673"/>calendar days. For example, a cost of effort of 20
          hours for a person who <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0674"/>works 8-hour days and can work on the task 60 percent
          of the time yields 1.5 calendar days (20 hours × 0.6 ÷ 8 hours = 1.5
          calendar days).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0675"/></p><p>Ideally, the project has been sufficiently divided into tasks
          that each make up no more than 5 to 10 percent of the project
          duration and last less than two weeks. To estimate a project with
          dozens of tasks to track, you need to split apart the project into
          smaller tasks, understand the assumptions, identify the risks, and
          then assemble the results. Dividing the project into a series of
          smaller tasks improves the accuracy of your estimate, because
          estimates of time required for smaller tasks are more likely to be
          accurate, as the pieces are easier to understand and often relate to
          previous work for which effort is known. If smaller estimates are
          created properly and without <span class="emphasis"><em>estimation biases</em></span>
          (discussed later in this chapter), they will, on average, be more
          accurate. Per-task estimates that miss the mark on the high or low
          end tend to average out statistically for the entire project if no
          single estimated component is considerably larger than the others.
          If a single estimated component is considerably larger than the
          others, break it down into smaller tasks and estimate these
          tasks.</p><p>When <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0676"/>building your estimate, first gather information from
          development team members about the issues that will affect the
          project creation and delivery. Consider each developer's unique
          productivity level: The same task might take considerably more time
          if undertaken by one engineer versus another with different skills,
          attitude, and experience. Estimates also need to account for time
          necessary to work on other projects assigned to team members.</p><p>Next, create a list of tasks (the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>approach</em></span>) required to complete the project. You
          can review the list of tasks required for other recent projects for
          comparison. A common estimation mistake is omitting important steps,
          including those that are not in the "critical path" or those that
          seem uninteresting. As you might not remember every task, consider
          the following list of easy-to-overlook tasks as you compile your
          estimate:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Testing</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Customer requested changes</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Systems integration</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Staff vacations</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Build and packaging time</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Buffer times</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Documentation</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Alpha/beta release customer

          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0677"/>of business and the product it creates. If the
          business provides many small and similar type jobs, an estimating
          model with a list of choices and a quick summary can work well. If
          the business builds large <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0678"/>projects over a period of several months, creating a
          custom spreadsheet for each estimate might be necessary. Another
          alternative for projects with many dependencies is to use a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Gantt chart program</em></span>, such as Microsoft Project,
          to prepare your estimate. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0679"/>Gantt chart programs allow you to test sample
          schedules and calculate costs based on those schedules.</p><p>After you have created your task list and approach, you can
          start creating task estimates.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="creating_task_estimates"/>Creating Task Estimates</h2></div></div></div><p>To collect task length estimates, you can take several
          approaches. You can look back at past projects and use the
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0680"/>time required to finish each project step as a rough
          guide for what you'll need for the current project. This approach
          requires that you keep information on past estimates and the amount
          of time each task actually took to implement. Adjust these values
          only as needed to scale the task to your current estimate needs. In
          addition, consider that historic project data is valuable for
          identifying tasks that didn't get considered in the original
          estimate.</p><p>A second approach to get task estimates is to talk
          individually to developers and ask for their opinions. This approach
          requires that you engage in multiple conversations in which you
          explain the task and ask for help in creating the estimate. Make
          sure you ask what assumptions the engineer is making (for example,
          are the estimates in calendar time, or is the engineer counting on
          any specific tools or approach?) to ensure that these assumptions
          match your understanding of the efforts required.</p><p>A third approach is to select two to five senior engineers to
          be your "elite" estimation team. This group would meet to create
          estimates for new projects and evaluate change requests to projects.
          In the course of the work, each engineer can become a specialist in
          a particular area and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0681"/>offer insight into the expected costs of tasks in that
          area.</p><p>A fourth approach is to schedule an estimation meeting to
          estimate the tasks as a group. With this approach, you can describe
          each task to everyone and request that each participant create an
          estimate independently. Moving around the table and asking for
          suggestions can provide estimates, but people can show a first
          speaker bias, in which everyone adjusts their numbers to be closer
          to those of the first speaker. Consequently, you can ask that
          everyone write down his or her number and show the estimates at the
          same <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0682"/>time. An alternative is to use a specially made
          estimation deck of cards that team members can use to hold up their
          estimates simultaneously.</p><p>After everyone in the group estimation meeting offers input,
          ask the high and low estimators about their figures. Often they
          might have realized a key point about the task that other estimators
          have forgotten. Some discussion of the point can be useful as you
          settle on the most reliable estimate.</p><p>If limited information is available when creating task
          estimates, you and other developers might be more comfortable
          suggesting <span class="emphasis"><em>rough estimates</em></span>. A reasonable scale
          is roughly based on factors of 2: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours; 1 day, 2
          days; 1 week, 2 weeks, greater than 2 weeks. Break down tasks that
          take longer than 2 weeks into subtasks and provide estimates for
          those. If you draw a size line on the whiteboard, you can mark
          estimates up as they are made and view them in total, as shown in
          <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#sample_estimating_size_line" title="Figure 12-1. Sample estimating size line">Figure 12-1</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0683"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="sample_estimating_size_line"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e9147"/><img alt="Sample estimating size line" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266093.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 12-1. Sample estimating size line</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="considering_estimation_bias"/>Considering Estimation Bias</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you can create an estimate, you need to adjust numbers
          to account for <span class="emphasis"><em>estimation bias</em></span>. Estimation
          biases have multiple causes. For example, engineers are generally
          optimistic, especially about tasks they <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to
          do. On the other hand, they might forget about a few mundane
          details. Since <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0684"/>estimates turn into schedules by which the engineers
          are judged, some engineers will pad time <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0685"/>estimates—as a matter <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0686"/>of human nature. Another common bias is estimating
          more time required for tasks that an engineer doesn't want to do,
          especially if he or she believes the solution is technically
          inferior. Finally, some engineers might not be interested in
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0687"/>estimation and will spend too little time thinking
          through what is involved.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0688"/></p><p>Once the team estimates are in, you can revise estimates from
          team members based on their history, especially if you are getting
          information from only one or two engineers. Knowing a bit about each
          person's past predictions will help you know how to adjust their
          current estimates. You might multiply their estimates by a factor to
          account for past biases. For some engineers' estimates, the
          multiplier is as high as 2 to 3 times, implying that a job with a
          20-hour estimate will actually take 40 or 60 hours to
          complete.</p><p>An engineer's desire to perform a task can also affect his
          estimate. If he looks forward to doing the work, his estimate may be
          low. If he has no interest in the task, the estimate may be higher
          than it should be. You'll need to use your management sense to
          detect how much bias is present in the estimate.</p><p>After you have collected the estimate data, you need a simple
          approach to pulling together the final estimate.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="building_the_estimate"/>Building the Estimate</h2></div></div></div><p>With all the estimates in hand, you'll begin assembling the
          pieces into a cohesive picture. This picture should show estimates
          for all the elements involved as well as totals so that you can
          review your assumptions and make changes to the estimate.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0689"/></p><p>As soon as you have finished an estimate draft, "What if ?"
          questions will arise:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What if we implement some features and not others?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What if we add or remove staff?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What if we start earlier or later?</p></li></ul></div><p>Build your estimates to make it easy to answer such questions.
          A spreadsheet estimating approach is an excellent way to explore
          different options, because it can be set up to try out different
          options. If built correctly, it should make it easier for you to see
          the impact <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0690"/>of different feature sets, more or less staff on the
          project, and different start dates. A well-made spreadsheet will be
          designed so that single-cell entries allow for shifting feature
          sets, staff size, and start dates.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch12.html#cost_and_schedule_estimate_spreadsheet" title="Figure 12-2. Cost and schedule estimate spreadsheet">Figure 12-2</a>
          illustrates an estimating spreadsheet with key construction features

          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0691"/>estimates in desired units (hours in this example)
          that are multiplied by the factor in column D (Est. Mult.) to obtain

          extra time based on your experience with individual engineer's
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0692"/>estimates. Similarly, QA estimates for the tasks are

          costs and timelines (rough estimates) instead of exact hours (exact
          estimates). Add the delivery date and cost at the end of the
          estimate, because often the person receiving the estimate will not
          read anything other than those key pieces of information if the cost
          delivery dates are at the beginning.</p><p>Even when your estimate considers every detail of the project
          and is <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0701"/>written clearly and succinctly, things can go wrong.
          For example, when the job finally arrives in engineering, you might
          discover that the sales person sold something quite different than
          what you expected, the customer wants a different technical solution
          than the one proposed, and you have to start work immediately, even
          though two of your team members just left for three-week vacations.
          As you go into hyperdrive trying to clean up this mess, you realize
          that something went wrong between the point at which you completed
          the estimate and the point at which the job arrived in engineering.
          In the interest of avoiding future pain, you resolve to change your
          practices when it comes to delivering estimates.</p><p>Here is some general advice for anyone who has been burned by
          a new job that differs from that described in the estimate:
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Provide a written estimate and deliver it in
          person.</em></span> Anything else will adversely affect your health.
          A written estimate gives you the opportunity to identify mismatches
          between the customer's requirements and the estimate provided. These
          mismatches can be highlighted if you deliver all your estimates in
          person and talk through the details with the receiver. The
          combination of a written estimate for references and the interactive
          discussion adds considerable clarity about the estimate and about
          the assumptions made by the requestor and estimator.</p><p>Delivering the estimate in person is the best case, but it
          could be delivered by email as you talk on the phone with the person
          who's receiving the estimate. If you deliver the written estimate
          prior to talking to the person who receives it, it is possible that
          the estimate may be delivered to the customer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0702"/>and even approved by the customer before you can fully
          explain your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0703"/>assumptions and the estimate's intentions. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0704"/>Often the development team will be asked to bear the
          costs of fixing any problems created by misunderstandings or other
          miscommunications.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0705"/>Verbal estimates with no <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0706"/>written documentation usually lead to confusion and
          misunderstandings after a project is underway. Common
          misunderstandings occur because of miscommunications concerning the
          project start date, because engineering assumptions are not taken
          into account, customer assumptions are not passed on to engineering,
          rough estimates are taken as exact estimates and used for contracts,
          and customer requirements are not fully understood.</p><p>That said, don't count on estimate assumptions being taken
          seriously unless you emphasize them verbally along with the written
          descriptions. The person accepting the estimate might focus only on
          cost and delivery <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0707"/>time, ignoring other factors.</p><p>For assumptions that critically affect the company, make sure
          your CEO buys into them—consider, for example, a new project that
          requires that development delay working on another business-critical
          project to focus on the new one. In general, make sure that all
          stakeholders are aware of all the impacts resulting from performing
          work on the projects you estimate. If your company has a marketing
          group or product managers, include them in your estimate delivery
          process as well.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="collecting_raw_project_data"/>Collecting Raw Project Data</h1></div></div></div><p>Planning and creating estimates requires that you understand how
        people spend their time. Efficiency and process improvements benefit
        from time breakdowns as well. Any company that might be considering
        purchasing your firm will also want to see information on project and
        team efforts. You won't usually need to collect this data during the
        company startup or foothold stages, but it becomes important during
        the growth stage.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0708"/></p><p>One common approach to <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0709"/>collecting time-effort information is to buy a software
        package that tracks time per project per individual. Such packages
        generate reports to show the staff breakdown in different ways.
        Software consulting firms, agencies, and large companies often use
        these packages.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e9390"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e9393"/></p><p>However, a "<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0710"/>time card–tracking" package has some disadvantages for
        small firms: Some developers resent individual time recording systems
        and might leave the firm because <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0711"/>of them, and these packages are expensive to set up and
        maintain.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0712"/>Collecting coarse-grained time data in a spreadsheet can
        be an efficient solution for tracking project time at a growing firm.
        To set up such a system, you need to define project efforts and how
        you want to report data, and then collect the information in a
        particular format. The spreadsheet can have simple reporting built
        into it. You can ask engineers to summarize their hours in an email
        once a week. If you use a less formal approach for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0713"/>collecting data, you can simplify the process.</p><p>An informal spreadsheet approach provides information that is
        not <span class="emphasis"><em>strictly</em></span> correct, so don't use it for
        accounting or billing purposes. However, this data is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>mostly</em></span> correct, so you can use it for estimating
        purposes. Creating a high-level view will reveal information about
        where and how developer time is spent relative to where and how it
        should be spent to get maximum return.</p><p>One caution with this approach: Do not use this data collection
        process as an opportunity to micromanage your team. If you start
        nitpicking about why one week shows 10 percent more overhead hours
        than the next, your team members will become resentful and might start
        providing incorrect information.</p><p>To avoid this, make sure that the team knows how you are using
        the data. You can present the collected information to the team to
        show how you will be using the data in an estimating model. Explain to
        your team how this information benefits them, and they will be more
        enthusiastic about the process. Potential benefits of this information
        include improved planning, schedules that are not overloaded (forcing
        everyone to work weekends), justifications for more staff to handle
        more work, and clarity to executive management about the true costs of
        each request. When presenting the information to your team, also
        describe your efforts to make the overall data collection simple and
        lightweight. It is difficult for engineers to feel enthusiastic about
        an unnecessarily complex data collection effort that consumes their
        time.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="summarizing_data_using_a_spreadsheet"/>Summarizing Data Using a Spreadsheet</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch12s02.html#worksheet_tracking_engineering_time" title="Figure 12-3. Worksheet tracking engineering time">Figure 12-3</a>

          of how much <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0719"/>time engineering is spending on <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0720"/>maintenance and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0721"/>overhead, separate from the actual project work. You
          must know this information to plan future project work and create

          days.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0722"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0723"/></p><p>You can use the raw time data you collect to create
          <span class="emphasis"><em>average available percentages</em></span>. Consider this
          example: Suppose your development team spends, on average, 67
          percent of its hours over 8 weeks on project work (33 percent
          overhead) with no significant overtime. You can convert project
          hours into calendar hours like so: 100 ÷ 67 = 1.49. Using this
          information, you can determine that a task that takes 12 engineering
          hours to complete will require 12 × 1.49 = 17.91 calendar hours, or
          about 2.4 days (17.91 ÷ 8 = 2.24), to complete.</p><p>An automated approach to calculating overhead percentage can
          be incorporated into the data collection process. <a class="xref" href="ch12s02.html#calculating_overhead" title="Figure 12-5. Calculating overhead">Figure 12-5</a> illustrates this approach, using
          the total time and total project time to calculate overhead.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="simple_time_summary"/><p class="title"><b>SIMPLE TIME SUMMARY</b></p><p>I worked for a small company that grew fast. We did not have
            a method of estimating how much time teams spent per project. At
            the time, tracking packages were too expensive to purchase, as the
            business was not doing well. Individuals resisted time

          40-hour work weeks and not total hours. Significant overtime hours
          can skew calculations even if total hours are used—unless, that is,
          your team's standard practice is to work excessive amounts of
          overtime. (And if that's the case, your calculations will be
          correct, but you should reread the first section of this book,
          because you and your team probably don't have a healthy work-life
          balance.)<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0726"/></p><p>Another caution is to consider how <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0727"/>vacation time is averaged into your data. Vacations
          tend to be taken in May through August and in December, rather than
          being distributed throughout the year. Consequently, you should
          separate out your vacation time when <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0728"/>collecting data. In addition, look for vacation
          patterns such as many vacations during summer and the second half of
          December, and plan your projects accordingly.</p><p>Don't be surprised to discover that your team's non-project
          hours are in the range of 25 to 50 percent of the normal work hours
          per year. A typical technology company has 3 weeks of vacation, 7
          days of holidays, plus sick leave. These factors alone make up 10.4
          percent of the workdays per year. Meetings, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-12-0729"/>maintenance tasks, and other regular duties can take
          up a large slice of your team's time—from 10 to 40 percent,
          depending on the company and culture. With project hours being a
          percentage of total calendar hours, the inverse (1 ÷ percent
          availability) is used to convert estimate hours into calendar days.
          So, for example, 60 percent availability is figured like so: 1 ÷ 0.6
          = 1.67 (1.67 is the multiplier); therefore, 3 work days is 3 × 1.67
          = 5 calendar days for this situation.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm1_d1e9588"/></p></div></div>

      You need to choose a destination, decide who is going with you, figure
      out the costs, determine how you'll get there, plan for the unexpected,
      and finally take the first step out the door. With a project, you define
      the goal, assemble a team, set the priorities, create a plan, prepare
      for risks, define the framework for carrying out the project, and take
      the first step with a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0731"/>kickoff meeting. In both scenarios, planning your start
      before you take off will make the rest of the journey more
      pleasant.</p><p>In many small software firms, engineers jump directly to the
      middle of a project by immediately starting to write code and seeing if
      it works. However, forgoing a properly planned start will guarantee that
      the end product will face difficulties with delivery, customer
      satisfaction, quality, and cost. Imagine getting up one day, driving to
      the airport, and hopping on a plane you choose at random. It might be
      exciting at first, but it probably won't be much fun once you get
      there.</p><p>With any <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0732"/>project, or trip, you should first focus on <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0733"/>understanding the goal.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="understanding_the_goal"/>Understanding the Goal</h1></div></div></div><p>At the start <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0734"/>of the project, the goal might seem obvious: Build the
        software. The customer wants a particular problem solved and wants to
        purchase software to solve it.</p><p>Creating a general-use software program is not just about one
        customer's goal, however. A customer might ask for a very specific
        software solution but will not be sure that this solution will truly
        provide the answer to a core problem until after the software has been
        delivered and used in a production system.</p><p>As you begin to fully understand the customer's problems and
        solution requirements, you will begin to understand your
        <span class="emphasis"><em>company's</em></span> project goal. If you're building a
        product for a single customer, you can directly ask the customer to
        specify what is needed. If, however, you are selling a product to many
        customers with which you don't have direct contact, your product
        marketing team is responsible for understanding the market and acting
        as the development team's customer. Keep this information in mind as
        you consider how you need to understand the customer or user of your
        software and how your company and development team fits into the
        picture.</p><p>Once you understand your customers' problems and needs and see
        your company's role in providing the solution, your next step is to
        agree on your <span class="emphasis"><em>common</em></span> <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0735"/>goals. For example, consider the following questions: Is
        the customer looking for the software to reduce operating costs? Does
        the customer need the improved functionality to offer better customer
        service? Is your product part of a larger sale the customer is making
        with a fixed time frame? Is the customer trying to offer a totally new
        product or service to its customers? Is the customer hoping to produce
        a highly scalable system of which your product is one
        component?</p><p>The larger and more important the project, the more important it
        is for <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> to talk to the customer
        <span class="emphasis"><em>directly</em></span>. Without directly conversing with
        customers to understand what they are trying to achieve with a
        solution, you will likely miss the mark with the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0736"/>software you deliver. When you talk to individual
        customers, echo what you hear in your own words to be sure you
        understand. Ask about their current needs and understand their plans
        for using the product after rollout.</p><p>After the customer meeting, create a memo recapping the
        information and requirements as you understand them, and send this to
        the customer for review. This approach will help avoid potential
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0737"/>misunderstandings in the future.</p><p>Once the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0738"/>project's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0739"/>goals and requirements are clear, you can start the
        planning process by <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0740"/>selecting a project development team.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="assembling_the_project_team"/>Assembling the Project Team</h1></div></div></div><p>If your company is working on one large project, assembling your
        team is not a project issue, but a general staffing issue. Follow good
        hiring practices and build the best team you can (as described in
        <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. GROWING A SOFTWARE TEAM">Chapter 4</a>). Many small companies work
        on multiple <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0741"/>projects that draw from a common team of engineers. In
        this environment, choosing the right team for each project is critical
        to each project's success.</p><p>Many managers choose team members by focusing on each
        developer's availability at the time the project needs to start.
        However, availability shouldn't be your sole criteria: Consider the
        candidate's interest and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0742"/>enthusiasm for the effort; the project's priority within
        the company's workload; the candidate's familiarity with the
        technology, ability to work with customers and stakeholders, and
        diversification of assignments; and whether the project will help or
        hurt the developer's career.</p><p>Interest and enthusiasm for the effort are important criteria
        for a team member who will contribute to the project's success. An
        engineer who is excited to work on the project will be more likely to
        contribute in positive ways, especially if he or she has asked you for
        a chance to work on it.</p><p>The higher the priority of the project for your company, the
        more important it is to assign your strongest engineers to work on it,
        as long as they are enthusiastic about the effort. In addition,
        consider whether an engineer has experience working with the
        technology required for the project, or whether he or she will need to
        spend time learning it. If a candidate needs to learn, can you build
        this into the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0743"/>project costs and timeline and still deliver a
        successful project on time? Training as you go increases the overall
        project risk, which must be considered for high priority <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0744"/>projects.</p><p>Furthermore, if working on the project requires considerable
        interaction with the customer, does the engineer have a positive
        attitude toward building customer relationships and working with
        customers? If not, you would do better to assign an engineer who
        enjoys working with and listening to customers.</p><p>Next, consider whether you are assigning the same tasks to the
        same engineers again and again. This poor management practice doesn't
        help engineers build up their skill sets, which is important in
        helping team members gain flexibility in handling a wide array
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0745"/>of tasks. You will need such flexibility if team members
        become sick, leave for vacation, or leave the company. Also note that
        engineers get bored performing repetitive tasks, so assigning them new
        challenges can help them stick with your company.</p><p>Finally, consider whether working on the project will help or
        hurt a developer's career. Offering a senior engineer routine or
        low-level assignments can reduce his attractiveness to future
        employers. Many engineers realize this, and they'll start looking for
        new jobs if they see their assignments causing their careers to
        stagnate.</p><p>Spending time considering the best fit for the job is a valuable
        use of your time. Properly matching people to efforts not only boosts
        productivity, but also reduces risks and improves employee
        morale.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="substitutions"/>Substitutions</h2></div></div></div><p>Projects do not always unfold neatly—problems crop up in the
          process as team members' availability changes: Perhaps the project
          requires different numbers of engineers during different parts of
          the development process, or team members become unavailable during
          part of the project cycle. In such cases, you have more than general
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0746"/>staffing issues to consider.</p><p>Substituting one development engineer for another short term
          does not work well, especially if the substitute engineer's time
          involved is less than three weeks and his or her work does not
          result in a <span class="emphasis"><em>clear deliverable</em></span> (a clearly
          defined section of the code that can be evaluated on its own when
          the work is accomplished). First, the replacement engineer doesn't
          have the same level <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0747"/>of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0748"/>project identification as the full-time team member,
          which can lead to low-quality work. Second, the substitute engineer
          doesn't have the full-product perspective. He or she might make
          assumptions that can cause problems that are discovered only later.
          Finally, many engineers find it easier to rewrite others' work than
          to spend time understanding it, leading to wasted effort—which
          sometimes occurs twice, if the original engineer returns to the
          project and reinstates the original code.</p><p>Substitutions work best when a clear deliverable is defined as
          the engineer's goal, when the engineer has enough time and expertise
          to understand the code, and especially when the engineer has a
          positive attitude toward working with another engineer's code. If
          these requirements are met, spend time describing the requirements
          of the project to the new engineer in detail and walk through the
          specific deliverable with the engineer. Having another kickoff
          meeting with the entire team can be very effective—it allows the
          team to describe project status, open issues, and changes made from
          the original requirements. Finally, make sure that the new engineer
          agrees that the deliverable makes sense before sending him off to do
          the work.</p><p>Political pressure from outside engineering can try to force
          you to swap in a new engineer to show that "everything possible is
          being done" to finish a critical project. As development manager,
          you must explain the costs of this approach to others. If a
          substitution is warranted, consider keeping the substitute engineer
          longer term on the project instead of releasing him or her after the
          original team member returns.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="game_delays"/>Game Delays</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects are delayed at the start due to the
          unavailability of the team. You will be tempted on such projects to
          pile on engineers to help make up for the lost time, especially if
          you have a fixed completion date. If you feel so tempted, take a day
          off and read <span class="emphasis"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></span> by
          Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. (see "Additional Reading" on <a class="xref" href="ch02s09.html" title="Additional Reading">Additional Reading</a>). The next day, change your game
          plan. You can make up considerable time on a delayed project by
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0749"/>starting with a single senior engineer instead of a
          team. Together, focus on clarity of requirements, functional
          definitions, and system architecture. This will save you
          considerable time lost by delayed <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0750"/>staffing. Come to think <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0751"/>of it, you could start your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0752"/>projects that way even if the project did start on
          time and with a full team <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0753"/>coding.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0754"/></p><p>Some projects are delayed because a key team member isn't
          available at the start. If a project has a hard completion deadline,
          consider whether <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0755"/>starting the effort without the key team member makes
          sense. If the project can be reorganized to allow the starting team
          to do useful work, it may make sense to do that.</p><p>One other case of interest is a project that requires
          technical expertise your team currently doesn't have. It may be in
          your company's best interest to ask for a delay of release so you
          can get the expertise—either through a consultant or a team member
          doing research or getting additional training. Charging ahead
          without key expertise can be very wasteful of your company's time
          and resources.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="setting_priorities"/>Setting Priorities</h1></div></div></div><p>Before creating a project plan, you also need to examine
        priorities. Every project has different criteria for success that
        directs its priorities. For some projects, the schedule is the top
        priority because a firm delivery deadline is required. For other
        projects, the security of the product cannot be compromised, even at
        the expense of the schedule. Additional aspects of a project that need
        prioritization include features, costs, resource usage, quality,
        operational policies (how the project is run), reporting, and
        technology choices. Despite what a customer might say and want, not
        every aspect of a project can be top priority.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0756"/></p><p>Make a clear choice about your project's top priority. Identify
        the top priority along with the second and third most important
        priorities. The choices you make determine how you make trade-offs in
        your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0757"/>planning as well as how you make decisions during
        project execution.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e9861"/></p><p>A common top priority for software product is schedule—often,
        you're told, because "The Release Date Cannot Move." This is often the
        case when your company requires the project for display at a trade
        show that occurs on a fixed date. Knowing this up front will allow you
        to make ongoing adjustments to your project tactics to increase your
        chance of success. For example, if schedule is top priority, followed
        by quality, and your project is <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0758"/>running late, you might consider reducing features to
        ensure that you will release a high-quality project on
        schedule.</p><p>Regardless <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0759"/>of where functionality falls in your priority list, you
        will also need to prioritize the parts of the functionality you plan
        to build. A good way to evaluate what is most important is to ask
        yourself this question: If the project had to ship early with only one
        or two features complete, what would those features be? Working on the
        most important features first, instead of the easiest features to
        build, is beneficial if you are forced to ship early because schedules
        and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0760"/>priorities change. This happens far too often on
        software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0761"/>projects, so you should consider the feature priority
        order in advance.</p><p>With a plan in place, consider the framework for how you will
        organize the effort.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="selecting_the_framework"/>Selecting the Framework</h1></div></div></div><p>A common framework defines <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> a team will
        work on the project. Consider four areas: <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0762"/>interaction, process, standards, and tools. Without
        formalizing the process, you'll experience a status quo approach:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>We will do this the same way, using the same tools and
        processes we used in the last project</em></span>. This might be fine
        for completing the project, but failing to consider your framework
        carefully will lead to unpleasant surprises.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Interaction</em></span> defines how you want to work
        with the team and how team members want to work together, including
        collaboration, meetings, and reports. Some projects include specific
        instructions regarding interaction. For example, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Scrum
        process</em></span> (an iterative incremental process of software
        development) requires a daily standup meeting. Other projects might or
        might not include definitions of all the interactions of the team. A
        new project is the logical place to change the interaction style if
        you see the need.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Process</em></span> is the predefined, repeatable set
        of steps that the project will move through as it's being developed.
        In addition to repeatable steps, software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0763"/>development processes have different characteristics,
        some defining required meetings, reports, or specific types of
        communications as the project progresses. You should define the
        process that will be used for the project instead <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0764"/>of defaulting this decision to the team. <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. DESIGNING A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS">Chapter 15</a> describes
        different types of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0765"/>processes in more detail.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Standards</em></span> define the technical practices
        and languages used on the project, including coding languages, minimal
        coding conventions, and file interchange formats. Your choice of
        standards can greatly impact the quality and maintainability of the
        code your team provides. Typically, general technical standards are
        not clearly set at a small company, so you can use new <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0766"/>projects as opportunities to define solid
        standards.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0767"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Tools</em></span> describe the choice of software
        tools, software libraries, and hardware systems to be used on the
        project. Some projects are set up as a "free-for-all," in which any
        tool or system is okay to use as long as it pleases the engineers
        working on the code. While granting some flexibility to engineers on
        their choice of tools can be a good idea, not considering the business
        impacts of some tool choices is negligent. Either define the tools to
        be used or review the team's choices to understand the potential
        impacts of the choices before the project begins. See Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. EVALUATING YOUR TOOLS AND METHODS">Chapter 7</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. ASSESSING YOUR TECHNOLOGY">Chapter 8</a> for more information on tools,
        methods, and technology.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="mapping_out_the_timeline"/>Mapping out the Timeline</h1></div></div></div><p>A project timeline improves the product and process by mapping
        out initial task order. Start by creating a list of tasks and
        dependencies, and then put them in a reasonable order considering
        constraints such as staff availability. Next, estimate the cost of
        each step, both in hours of effort and projected time required. When
        calculating schedules in calendar time, consider that your staff isn't
        available to work on your project full time every week because of
        disruptions such as meetings, vacation, holidays, and illness. You can
        use a spreadsheet to build up your estimates and track time to
        complete the project as it progresses. All these techniques are
        covered in more detail in Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING">Chapter 12</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. PROJECT EXECUTION AND TRACKING">Chapter 14</a>.</p><p>Now let's pull these pieces together into a project plan.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="creating_a_project_plan"/>Creating a Project Plan</h1></div></div></div><p>Creating a clear, written agreement with the project
        stakeholders that details the project's direction and goals greatly
        increases your chances of providing a solid product that meets those
        goals. This agreement should describe the project's deliverables, when
        they are expected, the project's costs, and what documents describe
        the effort in detail. Equally important is an agreement regarding the
        project's risks, constraints, and open items (undecided
        issues).</p><p>A simple approach is to define all <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0768"/>of this information in a one-page <span class="emphasis"><em>project
        plan</em></span>. <a class="xref" href="ch13s06.html#sample_project_plan_template" title="Figure 13-1. Sample project plan template">Figure 13-1</a>
        illustrates a sample project plan template that can result in a one-

        a small company. However, the plan can serve as a useful communication
        device, because it frames the project for all the stakeholders,
        helping them understand your vision of the project and the problems it
        will face. The exercise <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0770"/>of creating the project plan will also help you in
        understanding the scope of the project.</p><p>Building the plan will require that you collect information on
        the project risks and priorities. Getting agreement on the project
        plan will require some negotiation about different project variables.
        Take care of this at the start of a project to eliminate some of the
        dissatisfaction that can result later from differing expectations for
        the project.</p><p>A one-page graphic, such as a Gantt chart or other device,
        representing the development effort can also be helpful at this phase
        of the project. A clear, single-page illustration can help project
        stakeholders easily grasp the efforts about to begin.</p><p>With the plan defined, you are ready to kick off the
        project.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="kickoff_meeting"/>Kickoff Meeting</h1></div></div></div><p>What is the best way to start the project? Even a short and
        informal <span class="emphasis"><em>kickoff meeting</em></span> improves project success
        and decreases time wasted, but make sure you schedule it so that all
        team members can attend.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0771"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0772"/></p><p>At the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0773"/>kickoff meeting, review the following areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Project team members and roles</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Goals and requirements of the project</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Customer, team, and corporate perspectives for this

        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-13-0774"/>enthusiasm for the project and its success. Set a
        positive tone, allow time for questions, and keep the discussion at a
        high level. You can fill in the lower-level details later in separate
        discussions.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm2_d1e10060"/></p><p>The kickoff meeting also serves as a ritual that defines a start
        of a new journey. Without a kickoff meeting, team members can feel
        like they are wandering toward the project rather than heading along a
        welcoming path toward a positive final goal.</p><p>With a successful kickoff, you have positioned your project for
        success. Now you're ready to start tracking and managing the

        might be behind schedule with thoughts like "So what if we're behind
        schedule? We have plenty of time to catch up." Instead, you need to be
        realistic and adjust your plans as the project progresses; don't wait
        for your team to fail. Respond quickly to project <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0780"/>delays with project reassessments, and implement
        appropriate changes to improve the schedule and outcome. You can make

                problems. Instead, as the project progresses, you must provide
                factual information to those who have a stake in your

                behavior is actually encouraged. Some senior managers don't
                want to know about potential problems: Don't tell me about it;
                just fix it! This attitude leads to delays in investigating or
                acknowledging problems until events force the discussion and a
                crisis ensues. Instead, inform the appropriate people of
                problems as soon as possible, and include your plans for
                resolving these problems. Dealing with and revealing issues

                the problems. Problems discovered late in the game are more
                difficult to resolve, as time and options are few. Not

                success can depend on your meeting your rollout promises.
                Waiting until the last minute to inform a customer that a

          at an approach to tracking your project during execution.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="last-minute_surprise"/><p class="title"><b>LAST-MINUTE SURPRISE</b></p><p>My company had multiple engineering managers reporting to
            the same general manager (GM). One manager worked on a project
            with a six-month schedule. The GM of the group held weekly staff
            meetings to review the progress of everyone's projects. Every week
            this manager would report that the project was on track. Six weeks
            before delivery, he said it would be on time. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0791"/>Five weeks before delivery, he indicated it was on
            time. Four weeks before delivery, he said it was on time.
            Marketing told customers that the software would ship in four
            weeks. At three weeks before delivery, the manager indicated it
            was on time. At two weeks before delivery, he said the project
            needs an extra three months.</p><p>This was a jaw-dropping moment. Either this manager had so
            little insight into the project that he did not know until two
            weeks before delivery that it would be late, or he had misled
            everyone until he was forced to admit there was a problem.</p><p>—Peer engineering manager<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e10268"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e10271"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e10276"/></p></div></div></div></div>

        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0793"/>software companies. One approach uses a <span class="emphasis"><em>Gantt
        chart</em></span> that lets you graphically track a project's progress
        against your original plan and predict a schedule outcome. As
        illustrated in <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#simple_gantt_chart" title="Figure 14-1. Simple Gantt chart">Figure 14-1</a>, a Gantt chart
        uses horizontal bars that each represent the length of time required
        for a task shown at the left. Arrows connecting bars are called
        <span class="emphasis"><em>dependencies</em></span>. A dependent task requires the
        completion of an earlier task before it can start. In this example,
        the pizza must be delivered and the table set before dinner can be
        eaten. Diamonds are used to mark milestones—in this case, the diamond
        marks that dinner is over.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0794"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0795"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="simple_gantt_chart"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e10316"/><img alt="Simple Gantt chart" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266105.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-1. Simple Gantt chart</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The second approach is a <span class="emphasis"><em>tracking
        spreadsheet</em></span> that measures progress against original
        estimates and predicts likely outcomes using predetermined formulas.
        You can expand a tracking spreadsheet to show a range of final
        delivery dates using minimum, expected, and maximum values for each
        step.</p><p>A Gantt chart works best when the project has many
        <span class="emphasis"><em>task dependencies</em></span> and when a moderate number of
        parallel tasks are required to complete the project. As Gantt charts
        typically allow for only simple calculations, they are not appropriate
        if you need more complex numeric analyses, such as the ability to
        track multiple ranges of outcomes or base times for events on
        formulas.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0796"/></p><p>In contrast, tracking spreadsheets work best for projects with
        fewer task interdependences, more steps in parallel, larger task

        contributing to a single release. In addition, you can adapt either
        approach to correspond to different process workflow and milestones.
        Consider the following simple example cases of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0799"/>projects and choices of approach.</p><p><span>Case 1</span>: You are asked to
        implement a new data interface feature to your online application. The
        data interface requires negotiating a data format with the customer
        and defining a user interface. You need to include a certification
        review step, and several intermediate code development steps need to
        follow a sequence. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0800"/>project requires a data scheme change after your team
        has completed the initial interface definition. For this case, a Gantt
        should work reasonably well: The project involves multiple
        interdependencies, a relatively small number of team members, and
        parallel tasks.</p><p><span>Case 2</span>: Marketing requires that
        development create 44 new customer reports for delivery in two months.
        You decide to split the tasks among your team of five engineers
        dedicated to completing the reports. After estimating the time
        required for the reports, the estimates vary considerably among them.
        You need to schedule each report separately for engineering, QA, and
        the documentation team. In this case, a tracking spreadsheet is
        appropriate, because the tasks are relatively independent and a large
        number of tasks are being assigned. A spreadsheet will allow you to
        shift tasks easily among individuals.</p><p>Now that you have the big picture, let's get to the particulars
        of using <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0801"/>Gantt charts and spreadsheets as project management
        tools.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="gantt_chart"/>Gantt Chart</h2></div></div></div><p>Most project management <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0802"/>software tools can be used to create Gantt-style
          charts. Commercial project management tools, such as Microsoft
          Project, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0803"/>offer considerable flexibility in the ways they can be
          used to configure and label a chart. The advantages of the chart
          include easy visibility of dependencies and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0804"/>project progress, and the ability to print out the
          chart for others to review. However, you won't enjoy these
          advantages if your chart is designed poorly or used
          improperly.</p><p>One common mistake is to provide only the underlying data in a

          Using two columns works well, but you can add a third or fourth
          column without distracting from the main information. For example,
          you could add a third column to this example for task start

          text to the left of each bar shows the total task time in consistent
          units (in this case, days); the task time information should be in
          consistent units—that is, you shouldn't switch among weeks, days,

          Update the Gantt at least weekly to reflect the actual project
          timeline and tasks. Performing regular updates makes the chart an
          accurate and complete record of the project's history. As you
          update, save copies of the older versions. Use version control
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0810"/>software to save copies of the file, or save files
          under different filenames based on dates or other pertinent
          information. Do not overwrite these files or you will lose
          historical data.</p><p>A useful feature of Gantt chart software is the vertical line
          that indicates today. As the project progresses, regular review
          cycles will occur daily, every other day, or weekly. At each review,
          you can adjust lengths and starting points of the bars to the left
          of the today line to reflect project history. If a task started
          late, move the task start to reflect the reality of what happened.
          If a step took more or less time, change the bar length to reflect
          that. If a staffing assignment changes, reflect this in the
          chart.</p><p>Times to the right of the today line reflect your best
          estimates of the future—the tasks that need to be completed and the
          time to complete them. Avoid the temptation to shorten future task
          lengths to maintain the end goal if past tasks took too long. Future
          task lengths should remain unchanged unless something has changed to
          justify shortening your estimate of the time required for an
          upcoming task.</p><p>In addition, maintain dependencies of future milestones based
          on past tasks unless a dependency no longer exists. For example, if
          step B follows step A, and step A was three days late, then step B
          will end three days later than originally expected. Stay
          honest.</p><p>Following this approach, you'll appreciate the Gantt chart's
          features. First, you can use the chart to communicate status. In
          addition, the Gantt continually predicts the future end dates of the
          project during development, based on dates and deadlines already
          passed along with your current best estimates. Good predictions help
          you plan for the future (or change a potential outcome before it
          happens) by adding staff, removing features, or sometimes
          rearranging tasks. Finally, the Gantt stores <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0811"/>project history, which is especially useful after the
          project is complete, during improvement reviews. In addition, you
          can use this information to create estimates for new projects in the
          future and to compare how engineers performed on their estimates
          versus actual delivery times.</p><p>A useful variation <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0812"/>of this basic chart is the <span class="emphasis"><em>dual-bar tracking
          Gantt</em></span>, which you can use to compare an original plan
          against the current status. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0813"/>Gantt chart illustrated in <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#gantt_chart_layout_example" title="Figure 14-3. Gantt chart layout example">Figure 14-3</a> works well in a dual-bar

          are few, when the number of tasks is large, and when the number of
          parallel tasks is large. You can use common spreadsheet tools such
          as Microsoft <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0817"/>Excel or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0818"/>OpenOffice.org Calc to create a tracking spreadsheet.
          Like a Gantt chart, a tracking spreadsheet allows you to compare
          results against the original plan as well as predict the likely
          outcome date. However, a spreadsheet also allows you to use complex
          calculations when making projections.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0819"/></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#tracking_spreadsheet" title="Figure 14-5. Tracking spreadsheet">Figure 14-5</a> shows a simple
          tracking spreadsheet. You can add tasks and subtasks fairly easily.
          Task times should be broken down into small increments of up to a

          hours or continuous time estimates. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING">Chapter 12</a>, a <span class="emphasis"><em>calendar-day
          estimate</em></span> incorporates any non-project time expected for
          the person doing the work. In making an estimate, the engineer
          accounts for other tasks and overhead tasks required during the week
          in addition to the task at hand. So if the estimate is for five
          days, the engineer is accounting for not only time directly working
          on the task, but time for overhead tasks and work on other
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0821"/>projects.</p><p>The alternative to using <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0822"/>calendar days is to track work hours expected for each
          task. Work hours are the actual hours required to complete the task
          if the engineer were working on the task full time. To create this
          estimate, use a multiplier to convert work hours into calendar days.
          The multiplier accounts for overhead and other tasks that prevent a
          worker from spending 100 percent <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0823"/>of his time on only assigned tasks. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0824"/>Software company overhead percentages can vary, but a
          common number is 30 percent, which leads to a multiplier of 1 ÷ (1 -
          0.30) = 1.42. See <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. PROJECT ESTIMATING">Chapter 12</a> for a more
          detailed discussion of this topic.</p><p>The spreadsheet calculates calendar date outcomes directly.
          <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#tracking_spreadsheet" title="Figure 14-5. Tracking spreadsheet">Figure 14-5</a>, for example, illustrates
          two different approaches to calculating end dates. The calculations
          can be based on today's date with time estimates added as required
          to complete the project (from the Left column), as shown for
          Projected Date 1. Alternatively, you can calculate the end date
          based on the project start date, plus the spent time, plus the
          estimate for time remaining (from the Left column, or column D)
          until the project is complete, as shown in Projected Date 2. The
          Projected Date 1 approach will shift the end date as you check the
          worksheet daily unless you continually update the Left column values
          or type in today's date as a number instead of using the
          <code class="literal">today()</code> function. The Projected Date 2 approach
          will not shift daily but can accumulate small errors in the Spent
          column that can lead to day errors near the end of the project. Both
          approaches require vigilance to ensure accuracy.</p><p>You can use the tracking spreadsheet as a project management
          tool. If necessary, you can modify work assignments as the schedule
          progresses. If you need to add a step, you can add an entire row,
          but set the Plan column value to <span class="emphasis"><em>zero (0)</em></span> and
          add a note, as you've added an unplanned item. To drop a step, leave
          the row in place, but set the Left column value to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>zero</em></span> and add a note. As with the dual-tracking
          Gantt, the spreadsheet will allow you to compare your original plan
          against the work history when the project is complete.</p><p>As mentioned, proper <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0825"/>project management requires that you accurately track
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0826"/>project status throughout the project effort. If you
          construct a model, it can be combined with project status
          information to predict future outcomes. If you don't like the
          outcomes, you can make changes to your project by asking
          <span class="emphasis"><em>what if</em></span> questions through your model. Change
          happens in most projects—staff changes, requirements change, and new
          opportunities and problems arise. A good model lets you deal with
          change rather than being buffeted by it.</p><p>Because this planning tool predicts the likely outcome each
          day, it allows you to make changes to improve the outcome. You can
          identify improvements through <span class="emphasis"><em>what if</em></span>
          calculations—What if I remove a task? What if I add a feature? What
          if I increase staff? Try the approach, view the revised outcome, and
          judge whether the change makes sense and gets the plan closer to the
          desired goal.</p><p>With the basics <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0827"/>of the tracking spreadsheet covered, let's consider a
          common problem that projects with many parallel tasks can face:
          balancing the workload among developers as the work progresses. The
          following sections show you how to make these changes using a
          spreadsheet.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="staff_assignments_and_workload_balancing"/>Staff Assignments and Workload Balancing</h3></div></div></div><p>As the project progresses, the plan will change as estimates
            change due to actual times and as new tasks are entered into the
            plan. Simply adjusting lengths of tasks will often leave you with
            an unbalanced set of assignments—that is, some engineers will be
            done with their assignments while others are still toiling away.
            Some rebalancing of workload can help, and you can use a simple
            approach to see what shifts make the most sense. Of course, you do
            have to account for engineers' skills and background knowledge
            while assigning tasks.</p><p>You can change team assignments to balance workloads during
            the project and to reduce the overall time required to complete
            tasks. This approach works best for projects in which flexible
            engineering assignments are made. <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#balancing_team_workload" title="Figure 14-6. Balancing team workload">Figure 14-6</a> shows a modified version of
            the sample spreadsheet shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#tracking_spreadsheet" title="Figure 14-5. Tracking spreadsheet">Figure 14-5</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm3_d1e10912"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="balancing_team_workload"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e10920"/><img alt="Balancing team workload" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266115.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-6. Balancing team workload</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>This spreadsheet allows quick <span class="emphasis"><em>what if</em></span>
            calculations based on time remaining on the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0828"/>project. In this simple example, adding initials in
            the Who column (column F) affects the days <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0829"/>of work remaining for each engineer (columns G and
            H). This allows you to make a quick assignment and balance the
            workload based on time remaining for the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0830"/>project by adjusting assignments until RC and JB
            have approximately the same amount of work to do. With dozens of
            tasks involved, performing load balancing manually can be a
            complex task. Of course, this spreadsheet can be easily expanded
            to cover a larger team.</p><p>Let's look at another variation of the tracking spreadsheet,
            the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0831"/>minimum-typical-maximum spreadsheet.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="minimum-typical-maximum_tracking"/>Minimum-Typical-Maximum Tracking</h3></div></div></div><p>A tracking spreadsheet can be set up to predict a range of

            for each task, the best case, the likely case, and the worst case
            scenarios can be examined at the same time. The "min-typ-max"
            tracking approach can be useful for dealing with risk management
            issues when the risks are known. It can help you visualize and
            address potential schedule risks early on.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#min-typ-max_tracking_spreadsheet" title="Figure 14-7. Min-typ-max tracking spreadsheet">Figure 14-7</a>
            illustrates an example min-typ-max spreadsheet. You can enter the
            range of task times from the original engineering estimates. As
            work progresses, enter spent time into the Actual column (column
            G). The Spent plus Remaining columns should provide a range of
            estimates for the total project effort in End Estimates. This
            spreadsheet uses the same formulas used in Figures <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#tracking_spreadsheet" title="Figure 14-5. Tracking spreadsheet">Figure 14-5</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#balancing_team_workload" title="Figure 14-6. Balancing team workload">Figure 14-6</a>; the key difference here is
            the addition of min, typ, and max columns for the plan and the
            remaining time. An additional row (row 9) sums the spent time and
            remaining time estimates.</p><p>In this example, the original plan had a range <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0832"/>of min-typ-max outcomes of 15-19-31 days. With tasks
            A and C done, the expected time outcome is now 21-23-28. The
            outcome is still in the predicted range, but it's closer to the
            worst case predicted in the original plan.</p><div class="figure"><a id="min-typ-max_tracking_spreadsheet"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e10978"/><img alt="Min-typ-max tracking spreadsheet" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266117.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-7. Min-typ-max tracking spreadsheet</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div></div></div>

        agreement of how a change request will be handled in these areas:
        decision, communication, payment, and documentation. For small product
        companies, a simple method of designating who makes the decision, how
        it will be communicated, and agreement on a recording mechanism should
        be sufficient. For a company selling billable services along with the

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="risk_management"/>Risk Management</h1></div></div></div><p>In addition to tracking projects and dealing with changes, a

        unexpected development problems, team member unavailability, and late
        changes to requirements. Finding risks early and working to minimize
        those risks leads to successful project deliverables. Waiting until
        risks become reality leads to unnecessary delays. A simple <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0843"/>risk management approach can improve your delivery
        success considerably.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0844"/></p><p>Small company risk management need not be complex. The effort
        involved in tracking and mitigating risks should match the size of the
        problems. Typically, medium-sized projects lasting several months are
        good candidates for risk management. Risk tracking for projects
        lasting under a month often has less utility, unless the project is on
        the critical path or it will directly affect a release date or a
        larger project.</p><p>A simple risk management approach is to create a risk list and
        review this regularly with the team during the project effort. The

        review the tracking table in a team meeting. A reasonable time frame
        is weekly for complex projects but less often for smaller projects. At
        the team meeting, anyone in attendance can identify a new risk. The
        project team determines risk value and who to assign to mitigate the
        risk impact. For existing items, the assignee reports on the status
        weekly. The assignee can work to reduce the risk's probability and
        impact. In some cases, the project manager will monitor low and medium
        risks and treat them as acceptable risks for the project. The team
        meeting can also be a time to brainstorm mitigations for any of the
        risks identified.</p><p>For most small company projects, your proactive efforts should
        focus on mitigating the high- and medium-impact risks. A risk is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>mitigated</em></span> when it goes away or is reduced to a
        low-impact or low-probability risk. For low-impact or low-probability
        risks, monitoring them for changes throughout the project is usually
        sufficient.</p><p>Team members should be encouraged to point out risks in team
        meetings. Tell your team that finding risks early makes them much
        easier to fix or prevent and helps ensure project success. Note that
        it is always better to point out a potential risk before it has
        occurred, instead of dealing with the aftermath of it. In some
        companies, the corporate culture discourages <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0847"/>risk identification, because anyone who points out risks
        is considered to be too negative. The development manager can set a
        positive example by listing his or her own observed risks.</p><p>The earlier risks are identified, the more <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0848"/>time-risk leverage is available to make adjustments at
        the lowest cost. <span class="emphasis"><em>Time-risk leverage</em></span> describes how
        the effort today is more effective (has more leverage) when the time
        before risk realization is long instead of short. The more weeks ahead
        of risk becoming reality, the less work effort you need to mitigate
        the risk and obtain a desirable outcome. Waiting until a few days
        before a problem becomes a critical reality means that it can take a
        large effort to change the outcome, if you can change it at
        all.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical scenario: A contractor cannot guarantee
        a security review of a key module when you need it, 10 weeks from now.
        A team member discovers this risk and reports it to the assigned risk
        mitigator, who starts calling other contractors to find an
        alternative. If, instead, the team member had discovered this risk a
        week before the critical help was required, finding an alternative
        contractor would be far more difficult, as few, if any, would be
        available on such short notice. You can calculate the expected risk
        impact on your schedule. If you enter percent probability along with
        risk impact in days for each risk, the effective impact can be
        determined by multiplying the two numbers. For example, 20 percent
        probability and a 10-day impact gives 0.2 × 10 = 2-day risk impact for
        that risk. Summing up all of the schedule risks will show the probable
        unmitigated impacts of all the risks. Knowing this number tells you
        the current total schedule risk to your project.</p><p>This example focuses on schedule impact while maintaining the
        other aspects of the project such as functionality. If the risk is
        realized, you would use the 10 days if they were required for the
        success of the project. For many projects, priority of different
        features varies considerably. If the work involves a lower priority
        feature and the schedule is of the highest <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0849"/>importance, the customer might decide to forgo a feature
        to meet the schedule. When you're considering how to determine the
        impact of different risks, focus on the core deliverables for the
        project and discount less essential tasks.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch14s04.html#outstanding_weighted_risk" title="Figure 14-8. Outstanding weighted risk">Figure 14-8</a> illustrates the
        cumulative schedule impact <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0850"/>of the outstanding weighted risk on the project. Given
        what you know when you updated the chart, the risk-adjusted schedule
        will likely result in a 12.5-day slip. If the risks in this case were
        identified at the start of the project, you could examine your
        abilities to mitigate those risks quickly. Otherwise, adding 12.5 days
        to your project schedule would be prudent.</p><div class="figure"><a id="outstanding_weighted_risk"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e11294"/><img alt="Outstanding weighted risk" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266119.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 14-8. Outstanding weighted risk</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>In summary, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-14-0851"/>risk management allows you to see the impact of

      everything a company has learned about creating and developing
      successful software products. It provides a foundation for efficient and
      successful future projects and gives a company a competitive edge. A
      development manager who picks the proper process, trains his team based
      on it, and then maintains practices for that process will likely have an
      effective team with high morale.</p><p>Unfortunately, problematic processes have earned poor reputations
      in some companies, where processes can be bloated, out of date,
      difficult to change, awkward to use, senselessly enforced, and generally
      responsible for slowing everyone down. These companies treat their
      processes not as tools for improving outcomes, but as ends in and
      <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0855"/>of themselves. Workers bearing the weight of a misapplied
      process grow resentful, particularly of the concept of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0856"/>development processes in general.</p><p>Many startup companies begin without having created a development
      process. As problems appear following the first few releases, it becomes
      apparent that some sort of order needs to be made out of the chaos.
      These companies need a development process, but they might not know how
      to choose, create, or implement one.</p><p>This chapter introduces you to software development processes,
      including types of processes and process selection.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="whats_in_a_software_development_process"/>What's in a Software Development Process?</h1></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>software development process</em></span> defines a
        systematic, repeatable approach to building software and usually
        involves a series of steps or a diagram showing activities and
        decision points. A development process formalizes the steps involved
        in defining, developing, testing, and releasing software.</p><p>Although many formal software development processes exist, they
        all set out to do the same thing: make software development
        predictable while supporting corporate goals. Processes do this
        through a repeatable recipe, with measurable steps along the way. The
        process inputs are product definition, desired schedule, workers,
        resources, and money budgeted. The measurable process outputs are
        delivery schedule, quality, functionality delivered, and money
        spent.</p><p>Different development processes use different strategies in
        their definitions. For example, some processes work to fix the
        functional definition early on and allow the schedule to vary, while
        other processes fix the development time per release and reduce
        functionality as needed. Processes also vary regarding number of
        iterations of the main tasks, the amount of feedback between steps,
        the nature of milestones, and the length of the development cycle.
        Because of these variations, different processes can emphasize
        different results, such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Minimal time to completion</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Accuracy of schedule prediction</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quality <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0857"/>of end product</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Cost of activity</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Risk reduction</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most accurately meeting customer needs</p></li></ul></div><p>Stepping through some of the more common processes used in
        software development can introduce you to different variations and
        what they optimize. The next section covers the most common processes
        in use.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="types_of_development_processes"/>Types of Development Processes</h1></div></div></div><p>Each process has its place, and no single process is the best
        solution for every situation. In some cases, sensibly customizing a
        process will provide the best results.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0858"/></p><p>The following sections offer brief overviews of various
        processes. You can consult with experienced process users or read a
        book about a particular process to learn more details. (See
        "Additional Reading" on <a class="xref" href="ch15s06.html" title="Additional Reading">Additional Reading</a>.)
        Each process has its advantages and disadvantages. Consider the
        environment of your company as you decide which process to use. Keep
        in mind that, in some cases, company political issues can render a
        great process unusable.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-8"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For process advocates who believe there is one ring

        process</em></span> due to their need for limited overhead and maximum
        speed. A lightweight process has a few basic steps, few key
        milestones, clear requirements, limited reporting, few sign-offs, and
        a few alternative paths. A lightweight process must be simple—so
        simple that a diagram <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0859"/>of the process fits easily on one page, along with a
        short description.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0860"/></p><p>The following sections discuss several process alternatives,
        starting with the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0861"/>ad hoc approach, which is the most common starting place
        for small <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0862"/>development projects.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ad_hoc"/>Ad Hoc</h2></div></div></div><p>Startup companies often design their first code without a
          formal process—that is, in an <span class="emphasis"><em>ad hoc</em></span> manner.
          Such an effort usually goes like this: The developer gets an idea,
          writes the code, and keeps adjusting it until he likes the result.
          This approach can be effective (and fun) on small
          projects.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0863"/></p><p>On projects that require more than one or two developers,
          however, ad hoc approaches produce unpredictable results in quality,
          delivery, and functionality. The results are generally poorer than
          those achieved by using a repeatable process. Ad hoc work is
          difficult to schedule accurately, and the overall cost of
          development increases exponentially as the size of a project
          increases.</p><p>Ad hoc works best for efforts involving the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>One or two developers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tiny to small efforts</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Prototyping an idea</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Technology experimentation</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="waterfall_process"/>Waterfall Process</h2></div></div></div><p>In its simplest form, a <span class="emphasis"><em>waterfall process</em></span>
          includes four major steps: define, design, implement, and test. Each
          step must be completed before the next one is started. Most
          companies implementing a waterfall process provide feedback paths,
          but they require special reviews, which can be slow or difficult,
          especially in some larger companies. The process diagram shown in
          <a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#waterfall_gantt_chart" title="Figure 15-1. Waterfall Gantt Chart">Figure 15-1</a> indicates how the process
          earned its name.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0864"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0865"/></p><p>Process advocates often point out the deficiencies of the
          waterfall process. One problem is that many projects lack a clear
          definition at the beginning, so completing the definition step first
          can be very difficult on a major project. Without a clear
          definition, many long feedback loops are incurred as the team
          discovers development problems later in the development cycle. In
          addition, if the team finds problems in an earlier step after that
          step has been completed and the project has moved forward, the
          process <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0866"/>of changing the earlier step can be cumbersome.
          Because each step must be completed and approved before the next one
          can start, development can be slower than other approaches.</p><div class="figure"><a id="waterfall_gantt_chart"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e11525"/><img alt="Waterfall Gantt Chart" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266121.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 15-1. Waterfall Gantt Chart</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The waterfall process also has its advocates, however.

          variation. Modified waterfalls allow some later steps to begin
          before the team has completed earlier steps. Most modified
          waterfalls provide monitored feedback loops so that when people find
          a problem while tackling one step, they can rework an earlier step
          to help fix it. For example, if the team detects a definition
          problem in the design step, the team reopens the definition step to
          work on it. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0868"/>Modified waterfalls usually define what to do in the

          consists of prototype creation. In each subsequent spiral,
          developers add increments of functionality to the project. At the
          end of each spiral, management evaluates the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0879"/>risk and makes the decision of whether or not to go

            other provides feedback. The joint development can lead to better

            named after a rugby term. Scrum uses fixed-length release cycles
            called <span class="emphasis"><em>sprints</em></span> that are usually 30 days long.
            At the start of the cycle, the team negotiates the definition for
            the sprint. A <span class="emphasis"><em>Scrum master</em></span> holds daily
            standup meetings and creates specific reports showing progress of
            the work toward completion. The team builds functioning code
            daily. When projected delivery exceeds the sprint length, the
            scrum master decreases the functionality until the team can meet
            the original delivery date. If marketing determines that the
            functionality must change, then the sprint resets and the team
            starts a new sprint. Scrum also uses specific project management
            methods during the cycle, which include daily reviews and specific
            reports.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0903"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0904"/></p><p>Scrum has the benefit of fixing the maximum functionality
            along with fixing the timeline at the beginning of the cycle. The
            functionality planned does not increase or change during a sprint,
            but the Scrum master can reduce it to fit the time available. The
            staff size remains constant for a cycle. Having potential
            variables fixed up front makes a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0905"/>Scrum process predictable.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="warning-11"/>Warning</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Warning Scrum does not allow functional changes

              their management will not allow them to do so—this seriously

          project and was, effectively, the project manager. This company used
          an extensive process that required many approvals at milestones.
          Most of the milestones required multiple signatures to get approval
          to move on. Some required eight different signature
          approvals.</p><p>One way to handle this was to route the forms with documents
          to eight different people. This process could take a week or two if
          a person was slow or out of the office. Making appointments was
          another slow and time-consuming approach. My solution was to walk
          the documents and sign-off forms around to each person and wait
          outside their office until they were available. I could typically
          finish this in one or two days.</p><p>I learned that many people signing really did not care to
          review the documents provided, but just wanted to ensure that they
          had a copy they could review. Others had only limited questions. My
          early conclusion was to minimize the signature approvals required in
          a process because they typically did not add value and did cost

        some cases, people grumble about having to change the way they do
        their work. If you continue to promote the process, gaining your
        team's acceptance will be easier. Promoting a process may be your most
        important action toward assuring its acceptance.</p><p>Training people on the software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0921"/>development process is crucial to its success. The best
        approach is to train people with an in-service workshop instead of
        sending them material to read. At the workshop, you can step through
        the process in detail and answer questions. Failing to train the team
        on the process indicates that you are not serious about putting it in
        place.</p><p>After your team has been trained, let everyone know the start
        date for switching over to the new process. For many small companies,
        the switchover can start immediately. In other cases, however, waiting
        until the next release effort starts will minimize disruptions to the
        current product development cycle.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="found_it_on_the_internet"/><p class="title"><b>Found It on the Internet</b></p><p>The manager <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0922"/>of our group was concerned that one of the engineering
          managers was not following a development process <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0923"/>and it was affecting quality. The engineering manager
          did not want to put a process in place, so he continued to sidestep
          the issue. The group manager was not familiar with software
          processes, so he found one on the Internet and told the engineering
          manager to use it. However, the group manager never followed up, so
          the engineering manager and the team ignored the new process.</p><p>The result was continued development without a process by the
          engineering team. It also lowered the team's respect for the group
          manager because of his inappropriate choice and lack of enforcement.
          After this, his job became more difficult.</p><p>—Software engineer</p></div><p>A process succeeds only if you monitor it and enforce it. You
        must set up a definition, measurable schedule, and quality goals. When
        you detect problems, spend time understanding the core issues.
        Processes usually require enforcement, which can mean talking to
        people when the process isn't followed to understand what happened.
        (You may need to modify the process if problems are uncovered.)
        Without enforcement, some people will skip steps to wait to see if any
        repercussions follow. Ensuring that the team follows the process is
        key to its success.</p><p>A great topic for an end-of-project "post-mortem" discussion is
        a review of the process, especially if its first use was on this
        project. Ask team members to examine the process to see whether it
        meets the company's and team's needs. Actively review the process
        steps one at a time to ask for suggestions for improvement.</p><p>Establishing a new <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-15-0924"/>software development process can take six months to a
        year, depending on the situation. It usually takes that long for
        people to understand it, realize its benefits, and become familiar
        with using it during the development process. Stick with it through
        the difficult times and enjoy the rewards later when you are more
        productive as a team.</p></div>

      place. You need to maintain it, and you need to review it periodically
      in search <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0926"/>of opportunities for improvement. Any process, whether a
      development process or any other type, can benefit from analysis and
      improvement.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0927"/>Improving a process can be exciting and fun for a
      development manager; it can have a significant impact on team and
      company productivity and morale. An improved development process can
      help make the development team more productive. Of course, when working
      with short development cycles and firm delivery dates, a significant
      process change can be risky. However, if the process is seriously broken
      or would benefit from a simple improvement, fixing it immediately can
      help you make a looming delivery date that once seemed
      impossible.</p><p>Larger companies <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0928"/>often use heavy tools such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0929"/>Six Sigma Analysis<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.CHP-16-FNOTE-1" id="CHP-16-FNOTE-1">6</a>]</sup> to conduct thorough analyses and revisions of their
      processes. Some managers have been put off while working for larger
      companies, however, where encumbering process improvement programs took
      too much time and offered too few results. Some larger firms use
      fossilized processes with unnecessary steps. At these companies, a
      manager's attempt to improve the process can result in political
      maneuvering, unnecessary studies, and long delays. Worse yet, the
      Six-Sigma improvement approach is too often applied to problems better
      suited to a simple analysis. The result can be worker cynicism in
      general at the mention of "process improvement."</p><p>Process improvement need not be intimidating, but heavy Six
      Sigma–type analyses are usually too time-consuming for a small company.
      Instead, a small company can benefit from the simple <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0931"/>modeling described in this chapter.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="creating_a_process_model"/>Creating a Process Model</h1></div></div></div><p>Development managers in small companies rarely model processes.
        Many development managers do not focus on process modeling, because
        their primary focus is to deliver the required software on time. They
        also might not have the tools or experience required for simple
        process modeling.</p><p>By skipping this step, however, you'll miss an opportunity to
        make important time-saving adjustments before your company begins
        rapidly growing.</p><p>The steps involved in creating a process model are
        straightforward:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Define the process boundaries.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List the process steps.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create a flow chart.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Estimate a range of times.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create a spreadsheet model.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Verify the model.</p></li></ol></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="define_the_process_boundaries"/>Define the Process Boundaries</h2></div></div></div><p>In defining the process boundaries, you identify the beginning
          and end points <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0932"/>of the process: Which step initiates the process, and
          which step occurs at the end? This might seem like a trivial issue,
          but it is important and should be considered carefully. Improvement
          solutions can become difficult if the wrong boundary is chosen. For
          the inputs to the process, define a single item which initiates the
          process, when possible. This might be a detailed description of what
          is desired, or it could be a set of requirements. For the outputs of
          the process, multiple deliverables are acceptable, but define
          clearly what they should be. For example, an estimating process
          might start with a form describing the requirements of the estimate,
          while the output might be a high-level definition and a separate
          cost or delivery estimate.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="list_the_process_steps"/>List the Process Steps</h2></div></div></div><p>Write down a list of steps and number them. Keep it brief: A
          single sentence for each step works well. If a step requires a
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0933"/>decision that will affect two or more steps that
          follow, label the step as a <span class="emphasis"><em>decision</em></span> step. If a
          step leads to <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel</em></span> steps, label the next
          steps as parallel. Processes often include
          <span class="emphasis"><em>recursion</em></span> (one step that repeats multiple times
          usually with changing input conditions) or
          <span class="emphasis"><em>iteration</em></span> (one step that leads back to an
          earlier step); you should describe the decisions that lead to
          recursion or iteration when listing the steps.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0934"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0935"/></p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="create_a_flow_chart"/>Create a Flow Chart</h2></div></div></div><p>For a simple analysis, a flow chart that uses boxes for steps
          and diamonds for decision points will do. Each box should correspond
          to a process step and use the same number scheme used for the
          process steps. Add a two- to three-word title in the box to
          represent the step, and add the name of the group, team, or person
          responsible for completing the step in brackets at the bottom. For
          decision steps, use a diamond-shaped box and add the decision
          keywords. Decision step boxes should show two or more arrows leaving
          them, showing the step choices resulting from the decision.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="estimate_a_range_of_times"/>Estimate a Range of Times</h2></div></div></div><p>Write down minimum, typical, and maximum (min-typ-max) times
          for each of the steps on the flow chart. At branch points, indicate
          the likelihood for each option as a percentage, along with its
          min-typ-max values. Be sure to indicate parallel workflow
          paths.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="create_a_spreadsheet_model"/>Create a Spreadsheet Model</h2></div></div></div><p>Create the spreadsheet model with each step in the spreadsheet
          corresponding to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0936"/>steps in the flow chart. Although a variety <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0937"/>of commercial <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0938"/>modeling programs can be used, a simple spreadsheet
          model works remarkably well to track the process at a small
          firm.</p><p>A simple approach is to use one row for each step in the
          process. Each row will use the appropriate step number, step name,
          and min-typ-max times expected. The total time for each step can be
          summed up at the bottom.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>decision branch point</em></span> occurs in a
          process when a decision is made that results in more than one next
          step option as the outcome of the decision. In the spreadsheet,
          decision branch points can be handled by shifting their calculations
          out of the main path. You can put multiple calculations based on
          branch choices off to the side and list them all along with percent
          of time occurrence for each and min-typ-max times. With two or more
          branch decisions, the minimum for the different branches should be
          the shortest of the minimum choices. Similarly, the maximum times
          will be the largest of the maximum choices. Typical times will be
          the percentage weighting of the typical times of the different
          choices.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0939"/></p><p>Processes often require <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel tasks</em></span>,
          in which a task spurs multiple substeps that occur in parallel
          before the step is complete. For example, an estimation step might
          require that you ask two developers for estimates, and though each
          estimate can be created independently, both estimates must be
          completed before the step is complete. Parallel tasks can also be
          calculated to the side of the main column of a spreadsheet. To
          simplify calculations, consider all parallel items as a single
          process step. For the entire process step, the minimum total time
          will be the largest value of the minimums of the parallel tasks. The
          typical total time will be the largest value of the typical parallel
          tasks. The maximum time will be the largest value of the maximum
          parallel tasks.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0940"/></p><p>Iteration or feedback paths are difficult to incorporate into
          a simple model. However, this situation can be modeled by turning
          the iteration path into its own workflow path. For example, if the
          steps in the process are A and then B, and B is a decision either to
          go back to A or go on to C, then you can convert the "go back to A"
          path to step D.</p><p>An example spreadsheet is illustrated in the next section,
          which should help clarify the spreadsheet layout potential.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="verify_the_model"/>Verify the Model</h2></div></div></div><p>Pass the model through the "smell test." Does it "smell"
          right? Do reasonable inputs provide reasonable outputs? If you make
          changes to an element, does it produce reasonable results? Have you
          reviewed the model with stakeholders (anyone who works on a
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0941"/>process step)? If so, then the model is ready for
          detailed analysis.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#CHP-16-FNOTE-1" id="ftn.CHP-16-FNOTE-1">6</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em>Six Sigma Analysis</em></span> involves a set of

          The surprising thing is that while the typical time is a long 3.8
          days, the worst-case time for the process is more than 10 days!

          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0948"/>of each option—50 percent each is typical. The maximum
          is the maximum for the two cases. A sales worst case takes 2 days to
          respond to requests, and this could cause a significant <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0949"/>process delay.</p><div class="figure"><a id="workflow_for_quote_process"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12793"/><img alt="Workflow for quote process" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266129.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 16-1. Workflow for quote process</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The parallel tasks in 6a and 6b are estimates provided by the

          impact of the reductions.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm5_d1e12833"/></p><p>A few reduction cases follow, targeting reduction in maximum

            take a week or more to produce. Your first goal is to reduce the
            maximum time from 7 days to 5 days for a quote. Start by examining
            the largest numbers in the maximum columns: the sales delay and
            the manager review. If you could reduce each <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0954"/>of these to 8 hours maximum, then the maximum time
            is reduced to 5.1 days. The next potential reductions are either
            the Java engineer's maximum time or the quote engineer's write-up
            time, each at 8 hours max. Changing the Java engineer's time to 7
            hours maximum adjusts the total maximum to less than 5
            days.</p><p>If possible, further reduce maximums to allow time buffers
            for unexpected events. One common unplanned event is the absence
            of key people, which requires a backup person to complete each
            step. Providing a second or even a third person as backup for the
            person primarily doing the work can help considerably when the
            worst case time is critical. <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#case_1_reduction_in_maximum_time" title="Figure 16-3. Case 1: Reduction in maximum time">Figure 16-3</a> illustrates these
            reductions in steps 3, 8, and 6.</p><div class="figure"><a id="case_1_reduction_in_maximum_time"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12864"/><img alt="Case 1: Reduction in maximum time" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266133.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 16-3. Case 1: Reduction in maximum time</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="case_2_reducing_the_typical_time"/>Case 2: Reducing the Typical Time</h3></div></div></div><p>The sales team is pleased that the worst case will be less
            than a week for new quotes. However, the sales manager now says
            that they need most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0955"/>of their quotes in 2.5 days. Your goal is to look at
            the typical cases and determine what reductions you can make. For
            typical cases, look at decision points and determine whether you
            can reduce the percentage for the slower decisions. In this case,
            can you reduce the percentage of time that the quote engineer
            needs to ask sales for more information from 50 percent to 10
            percent?</p><p>One approach to doing this might be to create a standard
            form that the sales requestor must fill out so all the required
            information is present. Entering 10 percent for the time sales
            uses cuts the typical time down to 3.25 days. If you ask sales to
            give their responses in 4 hours on average, the time drops to 3.2
            days. The other expensive typical time is the manager review at 8
            hours. You could require that the manager complete review in 4
            hours or drop the step all together. Dropping the manager review
            time to 4 hours makes the total time typically 2.5 days, which
            meets the goal. <a class="xref" href="ch16s02.html#quote_process_with_typical_improvement" title="Figure 16-4. Quote process with typical improvement">Figure 16-4</a> illustrates
            this example.</p><div class="figure"><a id="quote_process_with_typical_improvement"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e12887"/><img alt="Quote process with typical improvement" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266135.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 16-4. Quote process with typical improvement</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>You can also consider whether any steps can be dropped
            altogether or replaced with something else. Dropping the manager's
            review provides an interesting result. If the step is dropped, the
            total days dropped to a minimum <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0956"/>of 0.96, typical of 1.75, and maximum of 5.61 days.
            Dropping the review might be a possibility if most of the delay is
            caused by the availability of the manager and not the total time
            it takes to perform the review. If the 4 hours is due to
            availability and the review is short, you can work with the
            manager to allow others to respond to a review request if the
            manager is unavailable. Understanding the reason for the review
            can provide some insight as well. If the step is due to the quote
            engineer not having enough experience to be trusted, perhaps the
            situation can be improved over time. If the delay is due to
            manager review, and the manager is the only expert at the firm who
            knows a lot about some particularly complicated issue, dropping
            the review may not be a good approach.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0957"/></p><p>You can also look for ways of reducing the typical time
            required for a step. Approaches include adding more resources to
            the task, splitting up the work in a different way, providing
            improved tools for the person completing the step, redefining the
            step to reduce its effort, and providing training to the person
            who is completing the step.</p><p>Although these examples are simple, they illustrate
            effective approaches to analyzing <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0958"/>process workflows. Using a spreadsheet allows for
            experimenting with "what-if " questions in pursuit of particular
            time goals. For a small company, direct effective approaches work
            the best.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="working_with_other_teams"/>Working with Other Teams</h2></div></div></div><p>When the process workflow involves several teams, the
          challenge of making process improvements can be greater. If
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-0959"/>improving the overall process requires work shifting
          or reduction from someone other than an engineer, a development
          manager can lose perspective on the other team member's needs in the
          workflow. Instead of simply making requests, involve people outside
          your team in discussing process improvements and the impacts on
          their work. Negotiate for changes you would like others to make and
          be flexible in requests made of you. You might discover that changes
          in your team's steps can greatly ease the efforts for other
          groups.</p></div></div>

      change as well. From the early startup stage, to the foothold stage, to
      the growth stage, basic quality practices are required to keep the
      company from stagnating or failing to grow to the next level.</p><p>A <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0960"/>quality assurance (QA) team is devoted to evaluating and
      improving the quality <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0961"/>of the company's software product. Effective QA requires
      much more than simply testing new products, however. As discussed in
      earlier chapters, QA teams should also be involved in the product's
      definition, development process, and customer feedback.</p><p>In a small company, one manager is often in charge of both QA and
      development teams. In this role, the manager needs to coordinate both
      teams to locate and resolve core quality problems. A good foundation in
      QA practices provides insight in how to improve the productivity of the
      QA and development teams and the quality of the product. This chapter
      covers the basics of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0962"/>quality assurance for a small company development manager
      who has limited QA experience.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="importance_of_quality"/>Importance of Quality</h1></div></div></div><p>Small growing companies must focus on rapidly meeting their
        customers' needs. As customers continue to pour more requirements into
        the development mix, and as the company grows, the development manager
        faces challenges other than simply insuring that the team implements
        the new features. In fact, an exclusive focus on implementing new
        features is a trap that can make a manager lose focus on important,
        core issues. Continually adding new features and ignoring core issues
        is comparable to adding new floors to a building that has a weak
        foundation.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0963"/></p><p>If a manager focuses solely on the short-term development goals
        and loses sight of the bigger picture, the result will be a
        poor-quality product. Engineers might produce more features rapidly,
        but the features aren't as quality built as they should be, and the
        product and customer will suffer. Lack of quality critically affects
        small companies and development departments, as old issues take up
        time that should be spent for ongoing development. Quality problems
        can consume huge amounts of the development and QA teams' time.</p><p>Engineering can "sweep poor quality under the rug" when the
        company has a single customer and is working on a groundbreaking new
        product, but as the customer list grows, past quality issues will come
        back to haunt you. They can also lead the company into a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>crisis mentality</em></span>, where each new customer crisis
        results in the team scrambling to patch together a solution.
        Poor-quality products lead to lost sales and drive existing customers
        to other companies' products. Once customers label your company and
        its product's quality as poor, you will find it difficult to change
        their impressions.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="quality_matters"/><p class="title"><b>QUALITY MATTERS</b></p><p>My company never left the startup phase <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0964"/>of quality practices, although we had a number of
          large- and medium-sized customers. Poor quality cost us some of our
          earlier customers. Quality problems continue to affect our ability
          to work on new features; we are discovering major defects in our
          released software that require intense effort by engineering and QA
          to resolve. For a while, the development team spent half of its time
          fixing defects in the released software.</p><p>We are now setting up reasonable quality practices to dig
          ourselves out of this hole and are making some progress. The team
          noticed the improvements after about four months of effort.</p><p>—New QA manager</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="quality_defined"/>Quality Defined</h1></div></div></div><p>What defines quality? Ask a dozen people and you'll often get a
        dozen different answers. Some will answer that quality means including
        the latest features in the product. Others will talk about mean time
        to failure or lack of defects. Others will describe a product that
        gives the customer a positive impression.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0965"/>Defining quality ultimately comes down to the customer's
        perception. For most customers, a quality product meets the following
        criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Meets or exceeds the expectations of the customer (includes
            all aspects, such as capabilities, performance, and
            security)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Functions as intended</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Handles unexpected conditions in graceful ways</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is easy to use and intuitive</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is easy to upgrade</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is consistent across its feature set so customers are not
            surprised or confused by operations in different parts of the
            product<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e13041"/></p></li></ul></div><p>When measuring software quality, many developers focus on known
        <span class="emphasis"><em>defects</em></span>, or problems in the software that prevent
        it from being used as intended or expected. Such an approach, however,
        has several problems: First, who defines the <span class="emphasis"><em>intended
        use</em></span> of the product? And who determines whether an issue is
        a <span class="emphasis"><em>defect</em></span> or merely a <span class="emphasis"><em>feature
        change</em></span>? From a development perspective, an issue can look
        like a feature change, while the customer sees the same issue as an
        obvious defect.</p><p>By focusing only on defects, developers can miss other aspects
        of quality. Although keeping track of prerelease and post-release
        defects is very important, other aspects of quality should also be
        examined, such as accurate requirements, elegant design, utility, and
        long-term customer satisfaction. Finally, defects are only detected by
        way of focused efforts to locate them. Without a focused QA effort to
        reveal problems under the hood, a shiny new product's quality might
        appear better than it really is.</p><p>In addition, quality does not equate to the number of defects
        repaired in a release. Engineering and QA can identify and repair a
        large number of defects in a product, yet the product can still be of
        poor quality due to many undiscovered defects or because the product
        does not meet the customer's expectations. In fact, products with a
        large number of defects found and repaired are often still plagued
        with more defects yet to be found. Extensive testing of high-quality
        products often results in fewer defects, because they were built with
        quality in mind by a development team that used good design, best
        development practices, careful code construction, and attention to
        quality. A great QA team can assist by <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0966"/>encouraging positive practices, providing valuable
        feedback, helping instill an attitude of quality, and measuring the
        results with thorough testing.</p><p>A high-quality product exceeds the customer's expectations and
        meets the customer's core needs. With the bar set so high for software
        quality, how do you create a truly quality product? It boils down to
        starting with a culture that values quality.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="valuing_quality"/>Valuing Quality</h1></div></div></div><p>A company with a culture that values quality produces a
        high-quality product. A company that lacks this culture will not
        produce a high-quality product, because quality isn't the focus. If
        your company has a culture that values quality, your quality
        improvement effort will be easy. If not, talk to your CEO about the
        business impact of poor quality, and seek his support to improve
        quality overall.</p><p>To begin fostering a culture that values quality, train
        developers and QA staff to think about quality as an
        <span class="emphasis"><em>attitude</em></span> rather than simply a product goal or
        state. Building a "quality attitude" among members of the development
        team improves quality more than even the best QA practices. Why?
        Because having an attitude that values quality from the start will
        encourage the development team to build a quality product by getting
        clear requirements and by spending time understanding those
        requirements—through thoughtful design and with careful coding and
        review. In contrast, quickly coded solutions that are only polished
        through limited testing and repair will result in a product with poor
        quality baked in.</p><p>In addition, a good QA team can be an effective partner to the
        development team; although both teams focus on quality, QA personnel
        consider the product requirements differently from how developers
        think about the product. Engineers often focus on getting the product
        to work properly, while QA focuses on finding ways to break the
        product.</p><p>You can promote a quality attitude in a number of ways.
        Encourage developers to focus on checking their code before sending it
        to QA. Pairing a QA engineer with a development engineer during unit
        testing can prove effective in producing higher-quality code. Show
        your concern for defects generated during coding; this will encourage
        the team to create fewer problems. Set up development processes and
        methodologies that encourage quality to emphasize its
        importance.</p><p>You can improve your team's attitude toward quality by
        <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0967"/>encouraging people to view the entire product as the
        outcome, rather than the blocks of code each team member is writing.
        To encourage teamwork and help developers appreciate the product from
        a quality perspective, assign individuals as architects or leads for
        each product (or project when appropriate). The architect will
        coordinate the product coding and encourage the team members to act
        like a team rather than independent agents.</p><p>Improving quality can be a long and painful process if the issue
        backlog is high. Projects that suffered in the past from poor quality
        can serve as obstacles to success in many small firms. A development
        team cannot maintain a focus on quality if its products continue to be
        defective. Focus on fixing existing problems built into the product.
        Depending on the extent of the problems, you might be able to set
        aside time during a longer release cycle to undergo extensive bug
        repairs. If the problems are too extensive for a single release,
        schedule major defect repairs (sometimes called "bug scrubs") for the
        next few releases.</p><p>A key development control over product quality is the team's
        ability to repair defects. Improving the success rate of defect
        repairs by the development team will have a big impact on productivity
        and quality. Engineering attitude drives the repair success rate. This
        is addressed in detail later in "The Impact of Defects on Quality and
        Productivity" on <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html" title="The Impact of Defects on Quality and Productivity">The Impact of Defects on Quality and Productivity</a>.</p><p>As the team's focus on quality improves, product and work
        quality will improve as well. Your team can make improvements with
        each release; realize, however, that major improvements can take
        months or longer. Keep up the focus on quality for the long
        haul.</p></div>

        quality among members of the development and QA teams, you can assess
        the efforts toward that. A quality assurance assessment requires that
        you examine your teams and the tools, processes, practices, and
        measures they use to perform their work. Take note of the following

        detail, starting with the QA team.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_quality_assurance_team"/>The Quality Assurance Team</h2></div></div></div><p>Your QA team can drive a major movement toward a culture of
          quality in your company. Build a team of experienced QA engineers
          who share that culture. The best QA people are passionate about
          quality as the most important aspect of their jobs. The best QA
          engineers take it personally when a problem eludes them. Because
          they are continually looking for ways to improve quality, good QA
          engineers want to work for companies that care about it. These
          engineers make the effort to learn more about and apply the best QA
          techniques and approaches.</p><p>In contrast, some QA engineers see their work as all about
          testing. They care about it, but not enough to go the extra mile.
          These engineers do not look for clever ways to break the product or
          improve it. A strong QA team will support you in your efforts to
          improve quality. A weak team will want to focus only on
          testing.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="team_skill_levels"/>Team Skill Levels</h3></div></div></div><p>Build a QA team of engineers who offer the skill levels and
            attitudes that best match the needs of the company and its
            products. QA engineers come in all skill levels—from
            "push-the-button" website testers to gurus who write code to test
            other code. Do not expect people with low QA <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0970"/>skills to shine at testing complex systems.</p><p>Compare your QA team's abilities with the complexity of the
            work that needs to be accomplished to see if a mismatch exists.
            Review the artifacts they have created and observe the types of
            problems that get past them; this can help you assess their
            overall QA skills. QA artifacts include any item created to aid in
            testing, including documentation, test plans, test suites, test
            process, testing infrastructure, and test software. When talking
            with QA team members, assess their communication skills, as these
            are crucial to the job.</p><p>To assess your QA team's abilities, ask them the following
            questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>How <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0971"/>many years of QA experience do you have?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do you consider yourself a senior QA engineer?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How do you see the role of QA in the company?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Could you review a test plan you created with me?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What quality measurements do you recommend?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How does the current process promote quality?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How do you prefer to work with development engineers
                when resolving QA problems?</p></li></ul></div><p>To understand your QA team's effectiveness, observe the
            team's work habits. Some engineers work hard at continually
            improving the product and are well integrated into all stages of
            the development process. Others work in binges: When the product
            reaches QA, these team members work long hours to test the
            product, but when the product is out the door, they invest little
            effort until the next binge. This behavior, however, is not good
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0972"/>quality assurance, but is purely a testing function
            that occurs at the end of the line.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="staffing_levels"/>Staffing Levels</h3></div></div></div><p>At each company growth stage, different QA staffing levels
            are required and should be anticipated. In the startup phase, the
            QA staff can comprise a single person; this QA engineer should be
            a senior engineer who is well versed in quality practices. Hiring
            junior QA engineers with the goal of keeping costs low is a
            mistake, as they will not position the department for high quality
            as the company grows.</p><p>When your company starts getting established in the
            marketplace—the "foothold" stage—hire an experienced QA manager to
            direct the team. A company in a growth stage should hire a small
            QA team with a manager and should employ well-established quality
            practices. A successful team needs a strong set of tools and the
            appropriate QA computing environment. Poor-quality products will
            consume too much of your development time and eventually drive
            fledgling customers away.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="qa_tools_and_environment"/>QA Tools and Environment</h2></div></div></div><p>The QA software <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0973"/>tools and computing environment provide the foundation
          for the quality effort. Don't skimp on providing your team with the
          appropriate equipment and enough use licenses to get their jobs
          done. Doing so is unwise—and plain foolish.</p><p>A number of quality-focused software tools are available. For
          a small company, the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0974"/>tools and environment should focus primarily on three
          aspects: a defect-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0975"/>tracking tool, QA test environment, and test
          automation software.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="defect-tracking_tool_and_process"/>Defect-Tracking Tool and Process</h3></div></div></div><p>The defect-tracking process defines the workflow for
            handling defects. The defect-tracking tool is the primary method
            of tracking the status of defects and issues discovered by QA and
            development teams. These factors must be aligned to work together
            to provide the quality required by your company and its products.
            Because the defect-tracking tool enforces and enables the process,
            this section discusses them together.</p><p>The defect process should follow a simple workflow, such as
            the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Defect is reported.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Defect is reviewed and ranked. It may be put on hold

            workflow as a flow chart, with the decision point at step
            2.</p><p>Your defect-tracking tool must serve the needs of the
            organization and should not be a general-purpose task entry tool.
            Task tracking is fundamentally different from <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0976"/>defect tracking. Combining the two into one system
            leads to a system with too much information requested that is too
            difficult to use properly.</p><div class="figure"><a id="simple_defect_workflow_diagram"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_d1e13280"/><img alt="Simple defect workflow diagram" src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266137.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 17-1. Simple defect workflow diagram</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Your defect-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0977"/>tracking tool should be set up and used only for

            A dedicated defect-tracking tool improves the quality of the data
            collected and ensures that important information is easy to view,
            because the tool administrator can create data entry screens best
            suited for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0978"/>defect tracking. A dedicated defect-tracking system
            makes it easy to review and report on the data. In addition, a
            dedicated tracking system allows the defect workflow to match the
            stages defined in the defect-tracking tool.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-14"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A variety of defect-tracking tools are

                the process. With a clear map of process steps to tool states,
                the process workflow is encouraged and enforced by the tool
                workflow. If this isn't done, the tool workflow will be

                requested and required, the less likely a submitter will fill

                is assigned to clean up entry. Alternatively, entry can be
                restricted to development and QA team members to ensure that
                higher-quality data is entered, leaving people outside of

            evaluating the defect. In this step, provide a simple rating
            mechanism that can be useful for comparing one defect's priority
            against those of other defects.</p><p>Some defect systems are set up to require that the submitter
            be responsible for closing the defect. This adds overhead to the
            process, however, because the submitter takes on a secondary role
            of reverifying the defect fix. This approach usually results in a
            backlog of defects waiting for the submitter to close them;
            submitters often do not want to verify many defect closures
            because of the time required, and the task typically is not their
            primary task. Avoid this approach, because it will result in many
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0984"/>defects left unresolved.</p><p>Another system approach to avoid is using a separate state
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0985"/>for verifying the defect after <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0986"/>production release, because this adds complexity to
            the process. Instead, require that the QA engineer add a test for
            the defect into the test plan so that QA will automatically test
            for each defect repair in future releases.</p><p>Once you have set up the system, ask a member of the QA team
            to monitor the defects in each state. The monitor can review
            defects that "stall out" in any part of the system. The system can
            also be monitored to avoid a backlog of defects that surprise you
            at the end of the release cycle.</p><p>Keep the system simple and use it to track state
            information. Using a clearly mapped definition makes it easy to
            get statistics and to identify quality process problems.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="building_a_test_environment"/>Building a Test Environment</h3></div></div></div><p>Small growing companies have limited money to invest in QA
            testing. Most initial technology investments go toward the
            workstations and servers that are required to create and deploy
            the software. With budgets tight, management often neglects to set
            up the environment needed to duplicate the customer's system,
            making the QA job of testing and evaluating problems very
            challenging.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0987"/></p><p>A lack of a properly configured test environment may not
            lead to disaster in the short term if a company has only a few
            customers. With few customers, the team might hear about a few
            problems post-release directly, and the cost of fixing the errors
            might not be devastating. As the company grows, however, the costs
            of post-release problems left undetected because of an inadequate
            QA testing environment will increase significantly and affect the
            company's bottom line.</p><p>When a customer experiences a problem with a product
            post-release, that problem must become an immediate focus for your
            QA and development teams. Investigating and resolving production
            problems incurs a large immediate cost, especially if the
            customer's problem cannot be duplicated internally. Quickly
            setting up a test environment with the same equipment, memory,
            operating systems, application programs and settings, and program
            versions might not always be possible. Without the appropriate
            equipment, properly configured and available for immediate QA use,
            however, a post-release problem can prove devastating to
            productivity and customer perception of your product and your
            company.</p><p>Small companies benefit more from having the proper test
            environment set up from the start. Waiting until your company has
            grown to establish this environment will drag down productivity
            and customer satisfaction. As development manager, push to ensure
            that a proper QA test system is set up from the beginning.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="synchronize_your_systems"/><p class="title"><b>SYNCHRONIZE YOUR SYSTEMS</b></p><p>My company had a major problem and had lived with it for
              years before I joined. The infrastructure did not match

              often, we were surprised in production by code behavior we could

              We started the QA environment work immediately. As the cost of
              the speed testing was expensive, we provided several scalable
              options to allow for partial system testing initially, and we
              then built up to full system testing.</p><p>—Development manager</p></div></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="test_automation_tools"/>Test Automation Tools</h3></div></div></div><p>The requirements for test automation tools vary considerably
            for small companies. Test automation makes sense when the product
            is stable enough that repeatable testing is cost effective. For
            startups with rapidly changing products, test automation may not
            be effective because of the cost of maintaining a rapidly changing
            product. As the company enters the foothold and growth phases,
            test automation can be more practical and its value increases
            considerably. Automation can increase test accuracy while
            significantly reducing testing time.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0989"/></p><p>QA uses automation <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0990"/>tools to input a set of conditions into the software
            quickly and compare the resulting outputs against past results.
            Differences in results do not necessarily indicate an error in the
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0991"/>code; differences can be caused by intended changes
            in the code since the last regression results were stored, for
            example. When QA has reviewed all the results for accuracy, the
            outputs are saved as the correct values for later
            comparisons.</p><p>Test automation tools are effective for graphical user
            interfaces (GUIs) that are relatively stable and for products
            available for use on multiple platforms. Commercial tools that
            focus on GUI testing are available, such as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0992"/>Borland SilkTest (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.borland.com">http://www.borland.com</a>).</p><p>Test automation can be effective for testing files and data.
            Either commercial tools or manually created scripts can quickly
            cycle through standard tests and identify the differences between
            releases. To see how effective automation will be for your
            product, evaluate the rate of change in the automation output per
            release versus the cost of maintaining the scripts. If more than
            20 percent of the automation output changes per release, the
            product may not be a good candidate for script automation.</p><p>Another test automation approach is <span class="emphasis"><em>white box

            (a software framework to simplify the creation, running, and
            evaluation of unit tests) is used to test internal sections of the
            code. Often, the engineering team creates the unit tests and
            continues to maintain them. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0993"/>Test harnesses are worthwhile even if the GUI and
            features in code are changing, because maintaining them is not as
            expensive as maintaining external testing efforts. Test harnesses
            isolate code sections, many of which will not change per release.

          processes used. During the definition phase, QA should review
          requirements, specifications, and use cases created by product
          marketing. QA management should also review any outstanding defects
          and identify those that require repair in the next release. During
          the design and coding phases, QA should prepare test plans and work
          on test automation as required. During the testing phase, QA should
          execute test plans, identify defects, and back-check repairs made.
          In addition, QA should take measurements that identify the
          <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-0998"/>quality of the code during all phases.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch17s04.html#qa_activities_versus_software_life_cycle" title="Figure 17-2. QA activities versus software life cycle">Figure 17-2</a>

            team's efforts throughout the software development life cycle. QA
            team members can offer insight into product utility and ease of
            use, so allowing them to comment before engineering starts
            building the code will help ensure a higher-quality product. QA
            team members also need to understand exactly what engineering is
            building to determine how best to test the product. Before
            testing, QA will produce test plans to optimize the testing
            process and create a repeatable set of tests.</p><p>QA should be involved in reviewing the requirements and
            functional specifications of every product and should have an
            opportunity to review prototype designs. The development and QA
            teams should meet, listen to feedback, and make appropriate
            adjustments to the product definition.</p><p>The only thing worse than not allowing QA a voice in
            requirements <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1000"/>and functionality is not listening to and heeding
            what QA has to say.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="test_plans"/>Test Plans</h3></div></div></div><p>A test plan helps create a repeatable method for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1001"/>testing a product. Without a repeatable method,
            testing will be ad hoc—gaps will appear in the testing process
            that can result in post-release problems. Consequently, the QA
            team should create test plans for all products.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1002"/></p><p>Each test plan should be based on a standard template (see
            the next section) to assure consistency across the team and from
            product to product. This will allow each team member to use a
            reliable test plan to ensure consistency in construction.</p><p>Determining the scope of the testing to do is not always
            easy; for example, in small companies, some parts of a system may
            be overlooked and not tested. QA often neglects to test the
            internal tools used to maintain the product. Internal tools can
            require less strict testing than customer-facing
            products—especially regarding error messaging. However, testing
            still is required if the maintenance tool affects customer
            outcomes. Consider the following questions regarding internal
            projects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Does the code function properly for the
                administrators?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Will any usage side effects impact the customer?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is the entry error checking acceptable for an internal
                project?</p></li></ul></div><p>Produce a list of all the products and modules you use and
            review it with both the engineering and QA teams. Maintain this
            list as the product line changes. Each item on this list should
            have its own test plan.</p></div><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="test_plan_template"/>Test Plan Template</h3></div></div></div><p>Standardizing the test plan format by using a template makes
            it easy for any member of the QA team to run the appropriate
            tests. A test plan template provides a common layout and format
            for all test plans. Using a template makes it easy to review and
            execute test plans consistently.</p><p>A spreadsheet-based template allows for easy data entry,
            status summaries, and progress tracking through summary
            worksheets. The layout should include multiple worksheets that
            correspond to different components to be tested. A Summary
            Worksheet can offer an overview of the entire <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1003"/>test plan.</p><p><span>Summary Worksheet</span></p><p>Summarize the test plan data on this worksheet by collecting
            information from the component worksheets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Percent complete of all worksheets in the

            Each worksheet ideally shows one test per row, so that the sheet
            is easy to work through and scan. Each test worksheet should cover
            these areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Functional <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1005"/>testing for the intended use cases</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Functional testing for edge cases (tests that push right
                to the edge of what is allowed)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Functional testing for error cases</p></li></ul></div><p>Each test in a component worksheet will use a unique number.
            The combination of the worksheet name and the number creates a
            unique identifier, which is useful for reporting and discussing
            problems. For example, Security worksheet, test 44, could be
            written like this: <span class="emphasis"><em>security-44</em></span>.</p><p>Each worksheet will feature one test per row with multiple
            field columns. The choice of fields varies based on need, but
            here's a typical list of fields for the plan:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Test number</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Description (with enough detail to describe the test

                first line should be 53")</p></li></ul></div><p>A row can include additional fields that are set each time
            the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1006"/>test plan is used:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Actual outcome for this test run (for example, pass, or

            differs from that of manual testing. QA can perform test
            <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1008"/>planning with a higher level description, defining
            what types of tests fit the automated testing approach. The
            individual test instructions are encoded into the automated
            system, while the results of the testing are usually listed in an
            output file. It is still possible to create a summary worksheet
            that covers both automated and manual testing.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1009"/></p><p>Increasing the percentage of automation can improve speed
            and accuracy of testing, because automated testing is faster to
            run and the tools identify correct results quickly. Automation
            improves the quality when multiple delivery platforms exist or
            when time to perform complete manual testing is limited.</p><p>The workflow for test automation should cover these
            steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Collect information about the tests.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Write test scripts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Edit and build test data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Run the automated tests.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e13710"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e13715"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Correct problems in one of three ways: Fix the script,
                fix the correct results data, or have the engineer fix the
                problem the scripts identified.</p></li></ol></div><p>Keep in mind that you can invest too heavily in automation
            at the expense of under-testing some parts of the product line.
            Review the cost of creating automation against the time saved
            during the test phase. Evaluate the benefit and cost of automation
            if more than 20 percent of an application is changing per
            release.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="qa_processes"/>QA Processes</h2></div></div></div><p>Basic <span class="emphasis"><em>QA processes</em></span> are essential for any
          company, especially for small startups. Without a clear process
          defined, work will not be repeatable and cannot be improved over
          time. Good QA processes allow you to control, measure, and improve
          product quality.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1010"/></p><p>Establish core QA processes as soon as you acquire the
          responsibility for the QA team. Set up a development process, a
          defect-handling process, a defect-ranking process, and a
          defect-selection process. The first two processes have been covered
          in earlier chapters and earlier in this chapter. The following
          sections cover defect-<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1011"/>ranking and defect-selection processes.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="defect-ranking_process"/>Defect-Ranking Process</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1012"/>Defect ranking requires a method of determining in
          what order defects should be dealt with. Many different methods can
          be used to rank defects, including ranking each defect using several
          different categories, such as severity, priority, and business
          impact. Ranking scales vary considerably from company to company,
          with some choosing alphabetic ranking, some choosing text (such as
          Very Severe), and some using numeric ranking. The problem with a
          technique that uses multiple scales is that it engenders arguments
          about which defect to tackle first: How do you compare a 7 severity,
          B priority, 6 business, against a 2 severity, A priority, 8
          business?</p><p>One solution is to use a single number to encapsulate all the
          information. This number is the <span class="emphasis"><em>overall
          priority</em></span> of the defect (or feature). As many companies
          already use the term <span class="emphasis"><em>priority</em></span> for a specific
          purpose, this discussion uses a new term called
          <span class="emphasis"><em>ranking</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>number</em></span> or
          <span class="emphasis"><em>rank</em></span> to distinguish this process. The ranking
          number is the overall ranking of one defect relative to the other
          defects.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e13774"/></p><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1013"/>ranking number makes use of a simple range of numbers.
          Five categories works well, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the
          highest. Assigning a larger number to the most severe problem
          simplifies calculating <span class="emphasis"><em>defect impact</em></span>, as
          described later. You can use more numeric categories, but you may
          end up wasting time trying to fit defects into the range (for
          example, with a scale of 10, it can be difficult to select whether
          the defect is a 3 or a 4, and so on).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1014"/></p><p>You can use a table to encapsulate all the information into a
          ranking number. The table columns will list the categories of items
          to rank, and the rows will represent each ranking number. You can
          expand the number of categories as necessary by adding columns. Here
          are some potential categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Security</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Business need</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Functionality broken</p><p>How important is the broken feature relative to how often

              but it looks bad. Ranking GUI errors independently emphasizes
              their importance.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Data integrity</p><p>Risks to internal or customer data may require a separate

          would represent that <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1017"/>ranking for that category in each empty field. For
          example, a Business need rank of 4 could represent an important
          revenue opportunity of $100K or more; a Security rank of 5 could be
          a severe security risk that affects many customers with data
          exposure.</p><p>You can leave fields empty to indicate that the choice of
          category and value cannot be ranked. For example, a Security rank of
          1 may be omitted if no low-priority security issues exist.</p><p>After you have filled out the table corresponding to the
          company's values, you can use it to evaluate <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1018"/>defects. You can consider defects in more than one
          category. For example, a defect can be a Business need as well as a
          Customer-facing GUI. To rank a defect, read down each relevant
          category column until a description matches what actually exists.
          The highest <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1019"/>ranking becomes the defect's ranking number. So, for
          example, if a defect is a 4 in Security and 3 in Business need, its
          ranking number is 4.</p><p>Once a defect has been ranked, this information will be stored
          in your defect-tracking system. Most systems can show tables of
          outstanding problems, making it easy for you to sort outstanding
          defects by their rank, which allows you to focus on the
          highest-ranking defects first.</p><p>Ranking numbers provide for consistency over time. This method
          allows you to compare the ranks of defects found a year ago against
          those of new defects, so you can avoid long sessions of reviewing
          hundreds of historical defects with every release. A ranking number
          should be changed only if the information associated with it
          changes. In general, QA is the best arbiter of a ranking. Do not
          change a ranking because someone insists that the defect be repaired
          faster.</p><p>You can extend this approach to cover enhancements as well as
          defects by creating a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1020"/>ranking table for enhancements. Because of the larger
          cost associated with enhancements and the quality impact of defects,
          it is better to treat enhancements and defects as separate
          categories of decisions.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="defect_selection_process"/>Defect Selection Process</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have a long list of defects, you might find it
            difficult to select which to tackle first. You can use a
            systematic approach to ordering defect repair. The following
            system triages defects when it is clear that not enough time is
            available to remove them all in the release cycle. This system
            works well for defect lists of moderate length, with perhaps 200

            rank different defects. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1021"/>RPC is a calculation of benefits that requires you
            to assign benefit values to ranking numbers. In this example, a
            rank 5 defect is twice as important as a rank 4. A rank 4 defect
            is twice as important as a rank 3. A rank 3 is twice as important
            as a rank 2. And a rank 2 defect is 1.5 times as important as a
            rank 1. This example assigns a rank 1 defect a value of 10 so that
            you can set up a relationship between defects and the repair
            benefit. (Using 10 as the smallest value has calculation

        key driver to overall quality and QA productivity for a small company.
        The quality of the code leaving engineering at the start of testing
        and the quality of the defect repairs drive the culture of the teams
        and the company. Unfortunately, many engineers do not give either of
        these issues enough thought.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1047"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1048"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e14442"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm6_d1e14447"/></p><p>A product's defect count as it enters the testing phase defines
        the quality of the shipped product and the schedule. The quality of
        the product is proportional to the quality of the product entering
        testing, because testing finds percentages of problems, not a fixed
        number of defects regardless of how many exist. Defect counts at the
        start of testing affect the schedule by adding to the overall cycle
        time for the testing team. Defects require identification and repair
        time, and large numbers of defects require more test passes to ensure
        quality code.</p><p>You can observe the effect of defect count at the start of
        testing on the total test schedule. <a class="xref" href="ch17s06.html#defect_reduction_vs_testing_passes_with_" title="Table 17-5. Defect Reduction vs. Testing Passes with 15 Percent Error Rate">Table 17-5</a> shows an example
        that compares starting defect counts of 300, 40, and 10 entering
        testing against the number of test passes. In all cases, assume that
        engineers will repair 85 percent of the defects properly, but they
        will repair 15 percent improperly, and these defects will require more
        work. Notice how starting with 300 defects requires four test passes
        to achieve zero defects. Starting with 40 defects needs three test
        passes. Starting with 10 defects requires two test passes. This
        illustrates how the initial defect count can have a big <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1049"/>impact on schedule.</p><div class="table"><a id="defect_reduction_vs_testing_passes_with_"/><p class="title"><b>Table 17-5. Defect Reduction vs. Testing Passes with 15 Percent Error

        are not properly fixed and new failures that are caused directly by
        the repair. It is fair to characterize an organization by its correct
        repair rate or, conversely, by the repair failure rate. For example, a
        25 percent failure rate indicates a sloppy organization in which
        engineers do not check their work or communicate with QA. A reasonably
        well-run organization should have a failure rate of 10 percent or
        lower. A 5 percent (1 failure in 20) organization is performing very
        well indeed: Development engineers are working closely with QA
        engineers before implementing a repair to make sure they understand
        the problem. Engineers are also checking their work to avoid
        introducing new problems.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1051"/></p><p>Let's take a look at another example. Assume engineering builds
        100 defects into a project that QA finds in the first test pass. Each
