    To share files, people had to copy data onto a floppy disk and then carry that
    floppy disk over to another computer. This method of sharing files, dubbed the
    *sneakernet* (since the data travels via foot power), made sharing information
    slow and tedious, but it also reduced the threat that malicious software, known

    that allowed callers to connect, read and write messages, play games, or copy
    files. The number of users that could be on a BBS at any given time was limited
    by the number of phone lines physically connected to the BBS host computer. On
    some BBSs, only one user could be on at a time, while on others, dozens or even
    hundreds of users could be logged on simultaneously.

    one in return. In this way, a BBS could constantly expand its file library.

    less and much greater. Currently, there are only a handful of viruses that infect
    Macintosh and Linux computers, so the number of existing viruses that could attack
    a Macintosh or Linux computer is relatively small. However, since so few Macintosh
    and Linux users worry about viruses, few people own, let alone use, Macintosh
    or Linux antivirus programs. The moment someone invents a new way to infect and
    spread a virus among Macintosh or Linux users, it will likely spread rapidly among
    many defenseless computers. The bottom line is that if you don't have an antivirus
    program, you will get infected eventually, no matter what type of computer and
    operating system you use.

    spyware in [Chapter 20](ch20.html "Chapter 20. Adware and Spyware").) Because

    and test, so people might wonder—why would anyone do something destructive and
    harmful to someone they don't know and will likely never see? Basically, some
    people write viruses for the same reasons that other people spray graffiti on
    buildings, smash car windows, or throw rocks from overpasses. The reason why people
    do any of these things is because they can, and because they can often get away
    with doing it.

    a handful of virus groups also created virus-writing toolkits. These toolkits
    often sported fancy pull-down menus and modern graphical user interfaces to make
    virus writing as simple as clicking the features you wanted from a menu and then
    waiting for the toolkit to create your custom virus for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the earliest virus-writing toolkits was called the Dark Avenger Mutation
    Engine (MtE). Virus writers could link their creations to MtE, which would mutate
    the virus's signature, turning an ordinary virus into a polymorphic one. Theoretically,
    MtE would make functionally identical copies of the same virus appear different
    from one another, making it impossible for antivirus scanners to detect the virus
    based on its signature. In practice, however, MtE proved difficult to use and
    couldn't completely mask a virus's signature, so few virus writers actually created
    viruses using MtE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the first mutation engine, MtE achieved notoriety solely for originating
    the idea of polymorphic viruses. While MtE never unleashed the flood of undetectable
    viruses that people originally feared, it did inspire other virus programmers
    to create toolkits of their own that could be, and were, used to generate viruses
    easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following the introduction of MtE, other virus writers created similar mutation
    engines with names like TridenT Polymorphic Engine (TPE) and Dark Angel's Multiple
    Encryptor (DAME). Like MtE, these other mutation engines had various degrees of
    success in creating viruses, although none lived up to its original promise of
    altering a virus completely to avoid detection. Viruses were hard enough to create
    in the first place, and few virus writers bothered taking the additional time
    to link their viruses to a buggy, hard-to-use mutation engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as virus writers studied these later mutation engines, they adopted
    the ideas and programming techniques for use in their own viruses. So while mutation
    engines never succeeded in their original goal, they indirectly inspired virus
    writers to create viruses that were harder for antivirus programs to detect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    With user-friendly pull-down menus and interfaces, these programs let wannabe
    virus writers pick and choose the features they wanted, and the virus creation
    program would create it for them automatically. One of the first virus-creation
    programs was the Virus Creation Laboratory, shown in [Figure 4-6](ch04s07.html#the_virus_creation_laboratory_offered_pu
    "Figure 4-6. The Virus Creation Laboratory offered pull-down menus to make custom

    viruses and concentrated more on developing their own virus-writing toolkits,

    "Figure 4-7. Virus writers soon flooded the hacker underground with virus-writing
    toolkits with different names and capabilities.") shows a list of typical virus-writing
    toolkits that you can still find today being traded on various hacker websites.

    viruses. In reality, they created viruses that either didn't work or were easily
    detected, so they could not cause much damage. Despite the attempts to automate
    production, virus-writing toolkits didn't made virus writing easier, nor did they
    flood the world with undetectable viruses as originally feared. If you want to
    write a virus, you still have to learn a programming language and understand the
    weaknesses of a particular operating system, and this effectively limits the art
    of virus writing to a handful of skilled souls interested in developing something
    destructive for no other reward than anonymous fame.

    the Trojan horse would format their hard disk and erase all their files.

    of the early IBM-PC Trojan horses, Trojan horses have been around since the first
    computers. One of the simplest and oldest types of Trojan horses is a password-stealing
    program. These are especially common on shared computers used by many different
    people, such as those in a school computer laboratory. Such computers typically
    require a user to type in a user name and password, so all a hacker had to do
    to steal someone's password was create a fake program that looked like the usual
    login screen. The fake login screen would store the information, return an error
    message, and then display the real login screen. The unsuspecting user would then
    retype his user name and password and gain access to the computer, never realizing
    that he'd actually fed his personal information to a password-stealing Trojan
    horse during that first login attempt.

    programs rely on trickery. Trojan horses usually run only once, but that is enough
    to wipe out files, steal passwords, or cause other types of damage. After the
    introduction of the PC-Write Trojan horse, malicious hackers started creating
    similar Trojan horses masquerading as games or utility programs like those commonly
    found on BBSs. Most would run once and wipe out all the files stored on a hard
    disk, thereby removing the Trojan horse itself as well and preventing it from
    spreading. So while Trojan horses are dangerous, they rely on the gullibility
    of users in order to propagate themselves.

    more than open a network port—a "backdoor"—into the infected computer. Now the

    information over the Internet, they divide their physical Internet connection
    into virtual ports, with each port handling a specific type of information; for
    example, email messages are received on one port and web pages are viewed through
    another. Port numbers identify the type of information received on each port so
    that the operating system knows where to direct it. For example, by convention,
    any data arriving at a computer's port 25 should be email, and any data arriving
    at a computer's port 80 should be a web page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing a RAT's server program does after infecting a computer is to
    open one or more ports on its network connection in order to broadcast its presence
    to the RAT client program. Since a computer can theoretically use thousands of
    different numbered ports simultaneously, and the gory details are hidden from
    the casual user by the operating system, most users will never notice if a RAT
    opens one of the many available ports or if an open port is being used by a RAT
    rather than a legitimate application.
  prefs: []

- en: After opening a port on an infected computer's network connection, the RAT server
    waits to hear from the RAT client, which runs on the malicious hacker's computer.
    How does the RAT client locate instances of the RAT server? Hackers simply scan
    the open ports on every networked computer they can find, searching for the specific
    port that the RAT server opens after it installs itself. Different RATs use different
    ports, and a RAT hacker can thereby tell when its RAT is at work on a machine.
    For example, a RAT named Backage uses port 411, while another RAT named Ripper
    Pro uses port 2023, although hackers can configure RATs to connect to any port
    number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RAT client files can only control computers infected by the corresponding server
    file, so a hacker would need to use the Ripper Pro's client file to control computer
    infected by the Ripper Pro server file, for example. Once a hacker finds an open
    port used by his particular RAT, he can use the RAT client program to connect
    to the server and, through it, control the infected computer as if he were physically
    sitting at the keyboard. Anything typed on the infected computer (passwords, credit
    card numbers, Social Security numbers, etc.) can be seen by the hacker running

    you install a program that uses product activation, it gathers information about
    the computer's CPU, hard disk, graphics card, and other hardware to create a unique
    identifier. Then the program sends this information, along with the serial number
    entered by the user, to the software publisher. This ties a specific serial number

    another computer.

    people from installing and using the software they legitimately bought. Symantec
    had similar problems when it started including product activation with its Norton
    Antivirus program. In Symantec's case, the product activation would ask for a
    serial number every time the computer booted up. No matter how many times the
    user typed in his valid serial number, the product activation would eventually
    shut down after a few days and stop Norton Antivirus from working altogether.

    that is not going to change anytime soon. People in developing nations and countries
    such as China and Russia pirate software because they can't afford it otherwise.
    That doesn't make piracy right, but given that the cost of a single copy of Adobe
    Photoshop is more than most people in the world earn in a month, it's safe to
    say that piracy will always be a more enticing option than buying software honestly,
    at least for some people.

- en: To fight back against piracy, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)
    and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) have used several techniques
    with varying degrees of success. Initially, the MPAA/RIAA targeted individuals
    sharing enormous numbers of files off their computers, such as a thousand or more.
    By suing these individuals, the MPAA/RIAA hoped to scare away others from sharing
    files too.

- en: To further discourage piracy, the MPAA/RIAA also "poisoned" the filesharing
    networks with bogus files. If people kept downloading bogus files, the MPAA/RIAA
    hoped that they would abandon the filesharing networks and turn to legitimate
    ones instead.

    programs. During 2005, the MPAA/RIAA managed to sue and shut down the publishers
    of Grokster and WinMX. By taking away the software used to swap files, the MPAA/RIAA
    hoped to shut down the filesharing networks one by one.

- en: For their latest tactic, the MPAA/RIAA has targeted the search engines that
    provide access to pirated files, such as BinNews.com, which allowed people to
    search Usenet newsgroups for warez, or IsoHunt.com, which provided links to BitTorrent
    files, such as full-length movies or major applications like Adobe Photoshop.

    pirated program to work can sometimes be more frustrating than going out and buying
    it. For hackers, software piracy is a challenge. For the average user, piracy
    is appealing only when it's convenient. But to dedicated software pirates, piracy
    can be a way of life, and nothing the software publishers can do will ever stop
    it.
