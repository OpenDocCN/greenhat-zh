<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I worked on the first commercial waterjet cutter. The machine was essentially a giant squirt gun that cut out tennis shoe insoles with a high pressure jet of water.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Since it was the first one ever made, we spent a lot of time tuning it. About a year. We had a deal with the tennis shoe maker who was buying it. They would give us free raw material to test with if we sent the cut pieces back to them.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">For about a year we tested. Since we wanted to get consistent results we almost always used the same test size: 9 right. We dutifully boxed up the cut pieces and sent them to the tennis shoe maker so that they could make shoes out of them. Or so we thought.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">About a week before we were scheduled to ship the machine we got a call from someone at the tennis shoe plant.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre15">Tennis shoe plant:</i> "Are you the people who keep sending all the 9 rights to us?"</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre15">Us:</i> "Yes."</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre15">Plant:</i> "Finally, I found you people. I've been trying to track you down for a year. Purchasing has no record of any cut piece order for you and it was very difficult to find you."</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre15">Us:</i> "Is there a problem?"</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre15">Plant:</i> "Yes. Do you realize that you've shipped us 10,000 nine rights and no lefts?"</p>
