- en: The word *rootkit* tends to have a negative connotation, but rootkits are just
    systems programs. The techniques outlined in this book can be—and have been—used
    for both "good" and "evil." Regardless, I hope this book has inspired you to do
    some kernel hacking of your own, whether it be writing a rootkit, writing a device
    driver, or just parsing through the kernel source.

- en: Before wrapping up, three additional points are worth mentioning. First, unless
    you are writing a rootkit for educational purposes, you should try to keep it
    as simple as possible; being fancy, only introduces errors. Second, like writing
    any piece of kernel code, be mindful of concurrency issues (both uniprocessor
    and SMP), race conditions, and how you transition between kernel and user space;
    or else, be prepared for a kernel panic. Finally, remember that you only need
    to find a handful of reliable, unguarded locations in order for your rootkit to
    be successful, while the anti-rootkit crowd needs to defend, more or less, the
    entire kernel—and the kernel is a very big place.
