Even those who deny being gamers often find themselves caught in the act of knocking off a quick round of solitaire between work projects. As a Linux user, you will most likely find that one of the most common questions users of other operating systems will ask you about Linux is “What games does it have?” Well, although there might not be as many games in the Linux world as there are on Planet Windows, Linux still has plenty to choose from. In fact, most Linux distributions come bundled with a number of games.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0003"/></p><p>Ubuntu, for example, comes with the games AisleRiot Solitaire (a collection of more than 80 solitaire card games, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#aisleriot" title="Figure 17-1. AisleRiot">Figure 17-1</a>), FreeCell Solitaire (a standalone version of one of the most popular solitaire games around), Mahjongg (a tile-matching game similar to the Xmahjongg game introduced in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Simple Kitten Ways">Chapter 8</a>), Mines (the Linux world’s answer to Minesweeper), and Sudoku (the Japanese number puzzle).

One of the most well-known and well-liked of these is Frozen Bubble (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#frozen_bubble" title="Figure 17-4. Frozen Bubble">Figure 17-4</a>). Frozen Bubble qualifies as the ultimate Linux classic: It was written for Linux, it’s Linux (penguin) themed, and Linux versions are always released first. It has since been ported to Mac OS, Windows, and even iPhone and Android systems, but Frozen Bubble’s soul is pure penguin.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0022"/></p><p>The objective of Frozen Bubble is simple: Clear the screen by matching like-colored bubbles so you can move on to the next level. This may sound boring, but never fear—you’ll be hooked in no time.</p><p>Another Linux-themed game you might be interested in is Pingus (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#pingus" title="Figure 17-5. Pingus">Figure 17-5</a>), a traditional maze game based on the old classic Lemmings. Your goal is to lead your group of adorable little penguins safely to the end of each level, without letting them be dashed to bits on the dangerous obstacles awaiting them. The game includes 22 playable levels, and if you’re feeling adventurous, you can try playing some of the untested levels—there are more than 200 of them!

Sure, 2D games can be fun—I’ve certainly lost a significant portion of my life to Sudoku—but they don’t have the excitement factor that you get from shooting hordes of aliens or crashing a high-powered sports car into a wall. Unfortunately, game designers have traditionally neglected Linux to concentrate on the significantly larger Windows market, so up until a couple of years ago, there were few Linux-friendly 3D games to choose from. As the penguin has grown in popularity, however, people have started to take notice, and more Windows games now come with a Linux version.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0027"/></p><p>The open source gaming community has grown by leaps and bounds too, and there are some really high-quality games now. In this section, I’ll run through a few of my favorites, after first making sure that your computer can handle the strain of 3D graphics.</p><div class="sect2" title="Checking for Hardware Acceleration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="checking_for_hardware_acceleration"/>Checking for Hardware Acceleration</h2></div></div></div><p>To play 3D games, you need a graphics card that can handle <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware acceleration</em></span>. Without hardware acceleration, your computer’s processor has to try to do all of the fancy graphics rendering itself (a task for which it just isn’t designed), so your games end up running at a snail’s pace, if at all. Most modern graphics cards have hardware acceleration support built in, but whether it is enabled will depend on the state of the Linux driver for your card. You can find out how good 3D support is for your graphics card at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards/</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0028"/></p><p>If you just want to know whether you have the minimum level of acceleration required to play games, then bring up the Dash, open a Terminal, type <strong class="userinput"><code>glxinfo | grep rendering</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap">enter</span>. (That vertical line is the “pipe” symbol and can normally be inserted by pressing <span class="keycap">shift</span> and <code class="literal">\</code> on your keyboard.) If you get a message telling you that glxinfo isn’t installed, use the Ubuntu Software Center to install <span class="emphasis"><em>mesa-utils</em></span> and then try again.</p><p>If hardware acceleration is enabled, you’ll see <code class="literal">direct rendering: Yes</code> appear in the Terminal. That’s good news, because it means you can skip to the next section and sink your teeth into some 3D gaming goodness.</p><p>If you received the message <code class="literal">direct rendering: No</code> instead, you’ll need to install different graphics drivers for hardware acceleration to work.

In fact, I still have a soft spot for Doom, arguably the granddaddy of all FPSs. What could be more fun than battling endless waves of hellish monsters in a military outpost on Mars? Nothing!<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0030"/></p><p>Doom looks a little dated nowadays, but if you have similarly nostalgic thoughts of this classic game, you’ll be pleased to know that a version is available for Ubuntu. It’s called Freedoom (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#freedoom" title="Figure 17-6. Freedoom">Figure 17-6</a>), and you can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center (like all the games in this section).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0032"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="freedoom"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18056"/><img alt="Freedoom" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263926.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-6. Freedoom</p></div><p>The gameplay in Doom may have aged gracefully, but the graphics sure haven’t. If pixilated blobs are failing to intimidate you, why not try something a little smoother in the form of Nexuiz (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#nexuiz" title="Figure 17-7. Nexuiz">Figure 17-7</a>)? In terms of gameplay, Nexuiz feels similar to Unreal Tournament—you collect a wide array of weapons and power-ups as you run around dimly lit levels, shooting at opponents of varying levels of (artificial) intelligence. As with most death match-style games, the aim is generally to be the last one alive, but there are other game modes, like “capture the flag.” There’s also an online multiplayer option if you’re finding that the computer-controlled opponents aren’t providing enough of a challenge.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0033"/></p><p>Tremulous (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#tremulous" title="Figure 17-8. Tremulous">Figure 17-8</a>) is another popular open source FPS, although its gameplay also contains elements of real-time strategy. You play online, taking the side of either humans or aliens. As you work to destroy the opposing team, you build structures and collect power-ups to gain as much of an advantage as you can. It can get quite involved, so I recommend that you read the notes at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tremulous.net/">http://www.tremulous.net/</a> before you begin playing.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0035"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="nexuiz"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18091"/><img alt="Nexuiz" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263928.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-7. Nexuiz</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="tremulous"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18099"/><img alt="Tremulous" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263930.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-8. Tremulous</p></div><p>Plenty of other FPSs are available: AssaultCube, Open Arena, Red Eclipse, and Alien Arena immediately spring to mind.

Plenty of these are waiting to be discovered in the Ubuntu Software Center, but I thought I’d mention a couple of good ones here.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0038"/></p><p>Warzone 2100 (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#warzone_2100" title="Figure 17-9. Warzone 2100">Figure 17-9</a>) is broadly similar to the Command and Conquer series of games. You start off on a battleground with a small collection of vehicles, which you must command to build a base and defend it from enemies. Once your base is in good shape, you can build new units and send them to attack your foes. Your opponents are doing the same, however, so battles can turn into subtle tactical affairs, where your ability to launch successful attacks must be balanced against the limited availability of resources and the constant threat that the enemy will destroy your base.</p><div class="figure"><a id="warzone_2100"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18143"/><img alt="Warzone 2100" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263932.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-9. Warzone 2100</p></div><p>If you’re struggling to find the time to mastermind an entire military campaign, perhaps Hedgewars (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#hedgewars" title="Figure 17-10. Hedgewars">Figure 17-10</a>) is more your thing. It’s a clone of the popular Worms game, which sees you in command of a small team of heavily armed worms (or, in the case of Hedgewars, cute little hedgehogs) scattered around an oddly shaped landscape. You take turns, using your overstocked arsenal to remove opponents from the map in elaborate ways before they can do the same to you. It’s definitely worth playing, if only for the interesting sound effects. . . .<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0039"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0040"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="hedgewars"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18169"/><img alt="Hedgewars" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263934.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-10. Hedgewars</p></div><p>A few other strategy games worth looking out for include 0 A.D. and Widelands, where you command an ancient civilization as it settles (and battles) the rest of the known world; Bos Wars, which is similar to Warzone 2100; and The Battle for Wesnoth, which has more of a fantasy vibe.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Simulators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="simulators"/>Simulators</h2></div></div></div><p>Waging war isn’t everyone’s idea of escapism, which is why an extensive collection of simulation games is available for Linux. I’ve tried to cover as many bases as possible in this section, but as always, you should peruse the Ubuntu Software Center if you don’t see something here that appeals to you.</p><p>When I think of simulation games, my mind immediately jumps to Sim City, the venerable city-building game. As the mayor, you’re in charge of running your city: You plan construction work, build and maintain transport links, and set budgets and taxes. Throw the odd natural disaster into the mix, and you have a challenge on your hands! The Linux equivalents of Sim City are LinCity-NG and OpenCity. I prefer LinCity (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#lincity-ng" title="Figure 17-11. LinCity-NG">Figure 17-11</a>)—the graphics seem friendlier and more cartoonish—but you should try both and decide for yourself. The original Sim City game is available too, if you don’t mind playing a game with old-fashioned graphics. Just search for <span class="emphasis"><em>Micropolis</em></span> in the Ubuntu Software Center (it was renamed for legal reasons). Finally, if managing a whole city sounds like a bit of a chore, you could always take a look at OpenTTD instead. It’s a clone of Transport Tycoon, which “merely” has you running the transport network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0043"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="lincity-ng"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18208"/><img alt="LinCity-NG" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263936.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-11. LinCity-NG</p></div><p>The hardcore flight-simulator enthusiasts among you will want to take a look at FlightGear (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#flightgear" title="Figure 17-12. FlightGear">Figure 17-12</a>). The focus is definitely on realism, with all sorts of cockpit controls and aircraft for you to play with. If you really want the full experience, there’s even an Earth-sized online multiplayer map to fly around. If you’re not already in possession of a pilot’s license, then it might be a good idea to read the manual before you play; you can find it at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.flightgear.org/Docs/getstart/getstart.html">http://www.flightgear.org/Docs/getstart/getstart.html</a>. For something a little less involved, and a little more warlike, check out gl-117, a combat flight simulator. Or, the humanitarians among you might prefer Search and Rescue, in which you pilot aircraft on various rescue missions.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0044"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0045"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0046"/></p><p>A little less serious than FlightGear is Torcs, a motor-racing game (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#torcs" title="Figure 17-13. Torcs">Figure 17-13</a>). It’s a pretty standard track racer in which you speed around a circuit against computer-controlled opponents. It has a good choice of cars, tracks, and race styles, and more are available on the Torcs website at <a class="ulink" href="http://torcs.sourceforge.net/">http://torcs.sourceforge.net/</a>. If off-road racing is more your style, take a look at the Trigger rally game. It’s not as well developed as Torcs, but it makes for a change.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0047"/></p><p>If you’ll permit me to stretch the definition of simulator just a little, there is a neat rock-star simulator called Frets on Fire (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#frets_on_fire" title="Figure 17-14. Frets on Fire">Figure 17-14</a>). The gameplay is very much like that of Guitar Hero, but with one major difference: You use your keyboard to play notes, rather than a guitar-shaped controller. However, if you don’t mind doing a little tinkering, you can get your Guitar Hero controller to work with Frets on Fire. (See <a class="ulink" href="http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/using-guitar-hero-controller/">http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/using-guitar-hero-controller/</a>.) Plastic guitar or not, it’s an addictive game.

The installation instructions, which you can generally find somewhere on the install CD/DVD, usually amount to little more than running an install script from the Terminal. The availability of a Linux installer on the same disc as the Windows version is still some-thing of a rarity among blockbuster titles though, so it’s often necessary to look online for one. A list of commercial games, some free and some for a price, along with helpful links to their Linux installers, can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php">http://icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php</a>. Wikipedia also has a few lists of Linux games that are kept up-to-date: Start at <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_gaming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_gaming</a> and see where the links take you. . . .<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0056"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0057"/></p><p>If spending the whole afternoon scouring the Web for decent games doesn’t sound too appealing, how about letting someone else collect the real gems for you? That’s what the rather splendid <span class="emphasis"><em>Humble Bundles</em></span> are all about: They’re collections of cross-platform games (all of them can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS) that are occasionally made available on a “pay what you want” basis. Depending on how much you choose to pay, you might also get access to bonus games and features. As an added incentive, every so often some of the games in the bundle are open sourced if sales of the bundle are sufficiently good. That’s what happened to Gish (in which you play a happy little blob of tar slipping and rolling through various levels and mini games) and Lugaru (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html#lugaru_comma_where_you_play_an_angry_com" title="Figure 17-15. Lugaru, where you play an angry, karate-kicking rabbit">Figure 17-15</a>), which features a rabbit, skilled in the martial arts, on a quest to avenge the deaths of his family and friends against wolves and rabbit conspirators. Both of these are now available in the Ubuntu Software Center for free.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0058"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0059"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0060"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="lugaru_comma_where_you_play_an_angry_com"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18407"/><img alt="Lugaru, where you play an angry, karate-kicking rabbit" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263944.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 17-15. Lugaru, where you play an angry, karate-kicking rabbit</p></div><p>To get your hands on a Humble Bundle, you’ll have to be quick—typically, the offers are only available for a short time—and you’ll only be able to buy the games individually, at a fixed cost, after that. For details on upcoming bundles, take a look at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">http://www.humblebundle.com/</a>. There’s also a list of all the previous collections on Wikipedia (<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Indie_Bundle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Indie_Bundle</a>); while you can’t buy those bundles directly anymore, it’s still a useful list of good, Linux-friendly games that you might want to explore.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0061"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0062"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0064"/></p><p>Another potential source of commercial games is the Ubuntu Software Center. It’s only recently started accepting paid-for titles into its listings, but the number of commercial games that you can obtain through its familiar interface is growing all the time. To see what’s on offer, fire up the Software Center and click the small downward-facing arrow immediately to the right of the All Software button. From the menu that pops up, select <span class="strong"><strong>For Purchase</strong></span>; then browse through the list that appears in the main pane of the Software Center window. As I write this, most of the software in the list consists of games (though other types of commercial software are available here too), with the majority priced from $5 to $20. For example, the award-winning puzzle game World of Goo, which sets you the challenging task of building wobbly structures out of blobs of black gloop, comes in at a pretty reasonable $19.95 (a demo version is available as a DEB package if you’d like to try before you buy; check out <a class="ulink" href="http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo">http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo</a>). Another top-notch puzzler is Braid (a bit cheaper at $10), in which you must solve puzzles by modifying the flow of time itself. As you saw in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a>, installing commercial software is very similar to installing anything else from the Software Center, except for an additional payment step. See <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#a-4_colon_commercial_vs._free_software" title="6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software">6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#a-4_colon_commercial_vs._free_software" title="6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software">6A-4: Commercial vs. Free Software</a> to get the full story.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0065"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0066"/></p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Penguins at the Gates">Chapter 19</a>, I’ll explain how you can also run Windows games in Ubuntu using Wine. Indeed, this is how many people enjoy big commercial titles that don’t have Linux versions: Guild Wars, Spore, and Call of Duty are just a few examples of games that can be run flawlessly in this way. If this sounds like your sort of thing, <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#project_19c_colon_running_windows_progra" title="Project 19C: Running Windows Programs">Project 19C: Running Windows Programs</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#project_19c_colon_running_windows_progra" title="Project 19C: Running Windows Programs">Project 19C: Running Windows Programs</a> will be of particular interest to you; there you’ll learn how to use a neat little app called PlayOnLinux, which can be used to handle most of the fiddly configuration stuff that is often required to get less well-supported games running under Wine.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0067"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0068"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0069"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0070"/></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 17B: Installing a Java-Based Game: Schnapsen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_17b_colon_installing_a_java-base"/>Project 17B: Installing a Java-Based Game: Schnapsen</h1></div></div></div><p>As you can see from most of the games discussed thus far in this chapter, the Ubuntu Software Center is a great one-stop shop for most Linux games. As you have also learned, however, there are also many games beyond those in the Ubuntu Software Center. These include the games you worked with in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Simple Kitten Ways">Chapter 8</a> that were written in scripting languages, such as the Python-based pyWings and the Tcl/Tk-based Briscola, but it just wouldn’t be right to leave out games written in what might be considered the mother of all scripting languages—Java. In this project, you’ll learn how to install the Java Runtime Environment and how to install and run the Java-based version of a classic Austrian card game, Schnapsen.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-17-0071"/></p><div class="sect2" title="17B-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_installing_the_java_runtime_en"/>17B-1: Installing the Java Runtime Environment</h2></div></div></div><p>To run Java-based applications, or <span class="emphasis"><em>scripts</em></span>, you need to first install the Java Runtime Environment. If you opted to install third-party software during the installation of your system, you already have the Java Runtime Environment installed, so you can skip this part of the project and go on to 17B-2. If not, then you can download it now via the Ubuntu Software Center. Just search for and install <span class="emphasis"><em>openjdk java 6 runtime</em></span>. The whole set of Java packages is pretty hefty in terms of download weight, so don’t get freaked out if this download takes longer than usual.
