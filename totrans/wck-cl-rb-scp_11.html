    <p class="calibre4">Well, this is the end of our adventure through a collection of wicked cool Ruby scripts. When we started, I recommended that you write down any ideas you had about creating your own wicked cool scripts. Now is the time to begin your own journey. I've enjoyed being able to share my passion for Ruby with you, and I hope you will continue to use the power of Ruby to solve any problems you may have. It's truly a wonderful language.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p class="calibre4">I'd love to hear your feedback about the scripts—like which ones were your favorites or more graceful examples that you've written. Through shared knowledge, we all benefit. I know technologies constantly evolve, especially on the Web, so if you find any errors in this book, be sure to drop me a line. Check out the book's website at <a class="calibre6" href="http://www.nostarch.com/wcruby.htm/" shape="rect">http://www.nostarch.com/wcruby.htm/</a>. Thanks again, and keep on programming!</p>&#13;
