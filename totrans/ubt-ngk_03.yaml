    goof around a bit by revisiting our precocious piscean pal, Wanda. Knowing what
    you now do about Wanda the fish, you might find it odd for me to start talking
    about her again, but Wanda has a few more tricks beneath her fins. In fact, she
    is a good means by which to introduce two of GNOME's most famous Easter eggs.
    *Easter eggs*, in case you don't know, are hidden snippets of code that programmers
    seem to love to sneak into their programs. They are usually pretty useless things,
    but they can be found in all operating systems, numerous applications, and even
    on DVDs (to find out more about those, go to [http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/](http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/)).
    A good example of an Easter egg is my first encounter with one on my first Mac,
    an ancient Mac SE with a whopping 2MB of RAM. On that machine, you could bring
    up an image (or was it a slide show?) of the Mac SE development team by pressing
    the seldom used debug key on the side of the machine and then typing **`G 41D89A`**.
    Pretty cool, I guess, but I would never ever have stumbled upon it had I not read
    about it in some magazine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    maneuvers, ones that you would never perform in the normal course of things. To
    see a Wanda-related Easter egg in action, click the **Run Application** button
    you just added to the panel, type **`gegls from outer space`** in the Command
    box, and then click **Run**. You will then see an odd little game of the Space
    Invaders genre, shown in [Figure 3-16](ch03s07.html#one_of_gnome_apostrophy_s_wanda-relate
