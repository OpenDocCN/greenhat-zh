    dancing randomly above the white paraffin cylinders that fueled them. I was too
    young to think candlelight romantic, but still I found it magical—because of the
    flickering images created by the fire. They shifted and morphed, grew and waned,
    all without apparent cause or plan. Surely, I believed, there must be rhyme and
    reason underlying the flame, some pattern that scientists could predict and explain
    with their mathematical equations. “Life isn’t like that,” my father told me.
    “Sometimes things happen that cannot be foreseen.” He told me of the time when,
    in Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp in which he was imprisoned and starving,
    he stole a loaf of bread from the bakery. The baker had the Gestapo gather everyone
    who might have committed the crime and line the suspects up. “Who stole the bread?”
    the baker asked. When no one answered, he told the guards to shoot the suspects
    one by one until either they were all dead or someone confessed. My father stepped
    forward to spare the others. He did not try to paint himself in a heroic light
    but told me that he did it because he expected to be shot either way. Instead
    of having him killed, though, the baker gave my father a plum job, as his assistant.
    “A chance event,” my father said. “It had nothing to do with you, but had it happened
    differently, you would never have been born.” It struck me then that I have Hitler
    to thank for my existence, for the Germans had killed my father’s wife and two
    young children, erasing his prior life. And so were it not for the war, my father
    would never have emigrated to New York, never have met my mother, also a refugee,
    and never have produced me and my two brothers.'

    it dawned on me that whenever he shared his ordeals, it was not so much because
    he wanted me to know of his experiences but rather because he wanted to impart
    a larger lesson about life. War is an extreme circumstance, but the role of chance
    in our lives is not predicated on extremes. The outline of our lives, like the
    candle’s flame, is continuously coaxed in new directions by a variety of random
    events that, along with our responses to them, determine our fate. As a result,
    life is both hard to predict and hard to interpret. Just as, looking at a Rorschach
    blot, you might see Madonna and I, a duck-billed platypus, the data we encounter
    in business, law, medicine, sports, the media, or your child’s third-grade report
    card can be read in many ways. Yet interpreting the role of chance in an event
    is not like intepreting a Rorschach blot; there are right ways and wrong ways
    to do it.

    uncertain situations. Those processes no doubt carried an evolutionary advantage
    when we had to decide whether a saber-toothed tiger was smiling because it was
    fat and happy or because it was famished and saw us as its next meal. But the
    modern world has a different balance, and today those intuitive processes come
    with drawbacks. When we use our habitual ways of thinking to deal with today’s
    tigers, we can be led to decisions that are less than optimal or even incongruous.
    That conclusion comes as no surprise to those who study how the brain processes
    uncertainty: many studies point to a close connection between the parts of our
    brain that make assessments of chance situations and those that handle the human
    characteristic that is often considered our prime source of irrationality—our
    emotions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, for example, shows that risk
    and reward are assessed by parts of the dopaminergic system, a brain-reward circuit
    important for motivational and emotional processes.[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts1a)

- en: The mechanisms by which people analyze situations involving chance are an intricate
    product of evolutionary factors, brain structure, personal experience, knowledge,
    and emotion. In fact, the human response to uncertainty is so complex that sometimes
    different structures within the brain come to different conclusions and apparently
    fight it out to determine which one will dominate. For example, if your face swells
    to five times its normal size three out of every four times you eat shrimp, the
    “logical” left hemisphere of your brain will attempt to find a pattern. The “intuitive”
    right hemisphere of your brain, on the other hand, will simply say “avoid shrimp.”
    At least that’s what researchers found in less painful experimental setups. The
    game is called probability guessing. In lieu of toying with shrimp and histamine,
    subjects are shown a series of cards or lights, which can have two colors, say
    green and red. Things are arranged so that the colors will appear with different
    probabilities but otherwise without a pattern. For example, red might appear twice
    as often as green in a sequence like red-red-green-red-green-red-red-green-green-red-red-red,
    and so on. The task of the subject, after watching for a while, is to predict
    whether each new member of the sequence will be red or green.

    notice occurs more frequently. That is the route favored by rats and other nonhuman
    animals. If you employ this strategy, you are guaranteed a certain degree of success
    but you are also conceding that you will do no better. For instance, if green
    shows up 75 percent of the time and you decide to always guess green, you will
    be correct 75 percent of the time. The other strategy is to “match” your proportion
    of green and red guesses to the proportion of green and red you observed in the
    past. If the greens and reds appear in a pattern and you can figure out the pattern,
    this strategy enables you to guess right every time. But if the colors appear
    at random, you would be better off sticking with the first strategy. In the case
    where green randomly appears 75 percent of the time, the second strategy will
    lead to the correct guess only about 6 times in 10.

    to be outperformed by a rat. But there are people with certain types of post-surgical
    brain impairment—called a split brain—that precludes the right and left hemispheres
    of the brain from communicating with each other. If the probability experiment
    is performed on these patients such that they see the colored light or card with
    only their left eye and employ only their left hand to signal their predictions,
    it amounts to an experiment on the right side of the brain. But if the experiment
    is performed so as to involve only their right eye and right hand, it is an experiment
    on the left brain. When researchers performed those experiments, they found that—in
    the same patients—the right hemisphere always chose to guess the more frequent
    color and the left hemisphere always tried to guess the pattern.[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts3a)

- en: IN 2002 THE NOBEL COMMITTEE awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to a scientist
    named Daniel Kahneman. Economists do all sorts of things these days—they explain
    why teachers are paid so little, why football teams are worth so much, and why
    bodily functions help set a limit on the size of hog farms (a hog excretes three
    to five times as much as a human, so a farm with thousands of hogs on it often
    produces more waste than the neighboring cities).[⁵](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts5a)
    Despite all the great research generated by economists, the 2002 Nobel Prize was
    notable because Kahneman is not an economist. He is a psychologist, and for decades,
    with the late Amos Tversky, Kahneman studied and clarified the kinds of misperceptions
    of randomness that fuel many of the common fallacies I will talk about in this
    book.

    although the basic principles of randomness arise from everyday logic, many of
    the consequences that follow from those principles prove counterintuitive. Kahneman
    and Tversky’s studies were themselves spurred by a random event. In the mid-1960s,
    Kahneman, then a junior psychology professor at Hebrew University, agreed to perform
    a rather unexciting chore: lecturing to a group of Israeli air force flight instructors
    on the conventional wisdom of behavior modification and its application to the
    psychology of flight training. Kahneman drove home the point that rewarding positive
    behavior works but punishing mistakes does not. One of his students interrupted,
    voicing an opinion that would lead Kahneman to an epiphany and guide his research
    for decades.[⁶](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts6a)'

    at people for badly executed maneuvers, and by and large the next time they improve.
    Don’t tell me that reward works and punishment doesn’t work. My experience contradicts
    it.” The other flight instructors agreed. To Kahneman the flight instructors’
    experiences rang true. On the other hand, Kahneman believed in the animal experiments
    that demonstrated that reward works better than punishment. He ruminated on this
    apparent paradox. And then it struck him: the screaming preceded the improvement,
    but contrary to appearances it did not cause it.'

    mean. That is, in any series of random events an extraordinary event is most likely
    to be followed, due purely to chance, by a more ordinary one. Here is how it works:
    The student pilots all had a certain personal ability to fly fighter planes. Raising
    their skill level involved many factors and required extensive practice, so although
    their skill was slowly improving through flight training, the change wouldn’t
    be noticeable from one maneuver to the next. Any especially good or especially
    poor performance was thus mostly a matter of luck. So if a pilot made an exceptionally
    good landing—one far above his normal level of performance—then the odds would
    be good that he would perform closer to his norm—that is, worse—the next day.
    And if his instructor had praised him, it would appear that the praise had done
    no good. But if a pilot made an exceptionally bad landing—running the plane off
    the end of the runway and into the vat of corn chowder in the base cafeteria—then
    the odds would be good that the next day he would perform closer to his norm—that
    is, better. And if his instructor had a habit of screaming “you clumsy ape” when
    a student performed poorly, it would appear that his criticism did some good.
    In this way an *apparent* pattern would emerge: student performs well, praise
    does no good; student performs poorly, instructor compares student to lower primate
    at high volume, student improves. The instructors in Kahneman’s class had concluded
    from such experiences that their screaming was a powerful educational tool. In
    reality it made no difference at all.'

    universal? Do we, like the flight instructors, believe that harsh criticism improves
    our children’s behavior or our employees’ performance? Do we make other misjudgments
    when faced with uncertainty? Kahneman knew that human beings, by necessity, employ
    certain strategies to reduce the complexity of tasks of judgment and that intuition
    about probabilities plays an important part in that process. Will you feel sick
    after eating that luscious-looking seviche tostada from the street vendor? You
    don’t consciously recall all the comparable food stands you’ve patronized, count
    the number of times you’ve spent the following night guzzling Pepto-Bismol, and
    come up with a numerical estimate. You let your intuition do the work. But research
    in the 1950s and early ’60s indicated that people’s intuition about randomness
    fails them in such situations. How widespread, Kahneman wondered, was this misunderstanding
    of uncertainty? And what are its implications for human decision making? A few
    years passed, and Kahneman invited a fellow junior professor, Amos Tversky, to
    give a guest lecture at one of his seminars. Later, at lunch, Kahneman mentioned
    his developing ideas to Tversky. Over the next thirty years, Tversky and Kahneman
    found that even among sophisticated subjects, when it came to random processes—whether
    in military or sports situations, business quandaries, or medical questions—people’s
    beliefs and intuition very often let them down.

    petty annoyances and adolescent emotions,” and “even if the work had come to light
    five years ago, when the subject [World War II] was timely, I don’t see that there
    would have been a chance for it.” That book, *The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne
    Frank, has sold 30 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books in
    history. Rejection letters were also sent to Sylvia Plath because “there certainly
    isn’t enough genuine talent for us to take notice,” to George Orwell for *Animal
    Farm* because “it is impossible to sell animal stories in the U.S.,” and to Isaac
    Bashevis Singer because “it’s Poland and the rich Jews again.” Before he hit it
    big, Tony Hillerman’s agent dumped him, advising that he should “get rid of all

    to Kill* was rejected by twenty-six publishers; his second manuscript, for *The

    Hollywood drew a $600,000 offer for the movie rights. Dr. Seuss’s first children’s

    and for him the trend was significant, for those six numbers represented the market
    share of Paramount’s Motion Picture Group for the final six years of Lansing’s
    tenure. The trend caused *BusinessWeek* to speculate that Lansing “may simply
    no longer have Hollywood’s hot hand.”[^(14)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts14a)
    Soon Lansing announced she was leaving, and a few months later a talent manager
    named Brad Grey was brought on board.'

    fail practically overnight? There were plenty of theories explaining Lansing’s
    early success. While Paramount was doing well, Lansing was praised for making
    it one of Hollywood’s best-run studios and for her knack for turning conventional
    stories into $100 million hits. When her fortune changed, the revisionists took
    over. Her penchant for making successful remakes and sequels became a drawback.
    Most damning of all, perhaps, was the notion that her failure was due to her “middle-of-the-road
    tastes.” She was now blamed for green-lighting such box office dogs as *Timeline*
    and *Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.* Suddenly the conventional wisdom
    was that Lansing was risk averse, old-fashioned, and out of touch with the trends.
    But can she really be blamed for thinking that a Michael Crichton bestseller would
    be promising movie fodder? And where were all the *Lara Croft* critics when the
    first *Tomb Raider* film took in $131 million in box office revenue?'

    abruptly her demise occurred. Did she become risk averse and out of touch overnight?
    Because Paramount’s market share plunged that suddenly. One year Lansing was flying
    high; the next she was a punch line for late-night comedians. Her change of fortune
    might have been understandable if, like others in Hollywood, she had become depressed
    over a nasty divorce proceeding, had been charged with embezzlement, or had joined
    a religious cult. That was not the case. And she certainly hadn’t sustained any
    damage to her cerebral cortex. The only evidence of Lansing’s newly developed
    failings that her critics could offer was, in fact, her newly developed failings.

    for the following year were already in the pipeline when Lansing left the company.
    So if we want to know roughly how Lansing would have done in some parallel universe
    in which she remained in her job, all we need to do is look at the data in the
    year following her departure. With such films as *War of the Worlds* and *The
    Longest Yard,* Paramount had its best summer in a decade and saw its market share
    rebound to nearly 10 percent. That isn’t merely ironic—it’s again that aspect
    of randomness called regression toward the mean. A *Variety* headline on the subject

    when I took a course in probability and began applying its principles to the sports
    world. That is easy to do because, as in the film business, most accomplishments
    in sports are easily quantified and the data are readily available. What I discovered
    was that just as the lessons of persistence, practice, and teamwork that we learn
    from sports apply equally to all endeavors of life, so do the lessons of randomness.
    And so I set out to examine a tale of two baseball sluggers, Roger Maris and Mickey
    Mantle, a tale that bears a lesson for all of us, even those who wouldn’t know
    a baseball from a Ping-Pong ball.

- en: The year was 1961\. I was barely of reading age, but I still recall the faces
    of Maris and his more popular New York Yankees teammate, Mantle, on the cover
    of *Life* magazine. The two baseball players were engaged in a historic race to
    tie or break Babe Ruth’s beloved 1927 record of 60 home runs in one year. Those
    were idealistic times when my teacher would say things like “we need more heroes
    like Babe Ruth,” or “we never had a crooked president.” Because the legend of
    Babe Ruth was sacred, anyone who might challenge it had better be worthy. Mantle,
    a courageous perennial slugger who fought on despite bad knees, was the fans’—and
    the press’s—overwhelming favorite. A good-looking, good-natured fellow, Mantle
    came across as the kind of all-American boy everyone hoped would set records.
    Maris, on the other hand, was a gruff, private fellow, an underdog who had never
    hit more than 39 home runs in a year, much less anywhere near 60\. He was seen
    as a nasty sort, someone who didn’t give interviews and didn’t like kids. They
    all rooted for Mantle. I liked Maris.

    54 home runs. Maris broke Ruth’s record with 61\. Over his career, Babe Ruth had
    hit 50 or more home runs in a season four times and twelve times had hit more
    than anyone else in the league. Maris never again hit 50 or even 40 and never
    again led the league. That overall performance fed the resentment. As the years
    went by, Maris was criticized relentlessly by fans, sportswriters, and sometimes
    other players. Their verdict: he had crumbled under the pressure of being a champion.
    Said one famous baseball old-timer, “Maris had no right to break Ruth’s record.”[^(17)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts17a)

    think about Maris’s achievement in a new light. To analyze the Ruth-Mantle race
    I reread that old *Life* article and found in it a brief discussion of probability
    theory[^(18)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts18a) and how it could
    be used to predict the result of the Maris-Mantle race. I decided to make my own
    mathematical model of home run hitting. Here’s how it goes: The result of any
    particular at bat (that is, an opportunity for success) depends primarily on the
    player’s ability, of course. But it also depends on the interplay of many other
    factors: his health; the wind, the sun, or the stadium lights; the quality of
    the pitches he receives; the game situation; whether he correctly guesses how
    the pitcher will throw; whether his hand-eye coordination works just perfectly
    as he takes his swing; whether that brunette he met at the bar kept him up too
    late or the chili-cheese dog with garlic fries he had for breakfast soured his
    stomach. If not for all the unpredictable factors, a player would either hit a
    home run on every at bat or fail to do so. Instead, for each at bat all you can
    say is that he has a certain probability of hitting a home run and a certain probability
    of failing to hit one. Over the hundreds of at bats he has each year, those random
    factors usually average out and result in some typical home run production that
    increases as the player becomes more skillful and then eventually decreases owing
    to the same process that etches wrinkles in his handsome face. But sometimes the
    random factors don’t average out. How often does that happen, and how large is
    the aberration?'

    a home run at each opportunity—that is, on each trip to the plate.[^(19)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c01-nts19a)
    In 1960, the year before his record year, Roger Maris hit 1 home run for every
    14.7 opportunities (about the same as his home run output averaged over his four
    prime years). Let’s call this performance normal Maris. You can model the home
    run hitting skill of normal Maris this way: Imagine a coin that comes up heads
    on average not 1 time every 2 tosses but 1 time every 14.7\. Then flip that coin
    1 time for every trip to the plate and award Maris 1 home run every time the coin
    comes up heads. If you want to match, say, Maris’s 1961 season, you flip the coin
    once for every home run opportunity he had that year. By that method you can generate
    a whole series of alternative 1961 seasons in which Maris’s skill level matches
    the home run totals of normal-Maris. The results of those mock seasons illustrate
    the range of accomplishment that normal Maris could have expected in 1961 if his
    talent had not spiked—that is, given only his “normal” home run ability plus the
    effects of pure luck.'

    a rather strong wrist, and a leave of absence from college. In practice the mathematics
    of randomness allowed me to do the analysis employing equations and a computer.
    In most of my imaginary 1961 seasons, normal Maris’s home run output was, not
    surprisingly, in the range that was normal for Maris. Some mock seasons he hit
    a few more, some a few less. Only rarely did he hit a lot more or a lot less.
    How frequently did normal Maris’s talent produce Ruthian results?

    equal to Jack Whittaker’s when he plopped down an extra dollar as he bought breakfast
    biscuits at a convenience store a few years back and ended up winning $314 million
    in his state Powerball lottery. That’s what a less talented player’s chances would
    have been. But normal Maris, though not Ruthian, was still far above average at
    hitting home runs. And so normal Maris’s probability of producing a record output
    by chance was not microscopic: he matched or broke Ruth’s record about 1 time
    every 32 seasons. That might not sound like good odds, and you probably wouldn’t
    have wanted to bet on either Maris or the year 1961 in particular. But those odds
    lead to a striking conclusion. To see why, let’s now ask a more interesting question.
    Let’s consider *all* players with the talent of normal Maris and the *entire*
    seventy-year period from Ruth’s record to the start of the “steroid era” (when,
    because of players’ drug use, home runs became far more common). What are the
    odds that *some* player at *some* time would have matched or broken Ruth’s record
    by chance alone? Is it reasonable to believe that Maris just happened to be the
    recipient of the lucky aberrant season?'

    both the talent and the opportunities comparable to those of normal Maris in 1961\.
    When you add it all up, that makes the probability that by chance alone one of
    those players would have matched or broken Ruth’s record a little greater than
    50 percent. In other words, over a period of seventy years a random spike of 60
    or more home runs for a player whose production process merits more like 40 home
    runs is to be expected—a phenomenon something like that occasional loud crackle
    you hear amid the static in a bad telephone connection. It is also to be expected,
    of course, that we will deify, or vilify—and certainly endlessly analyze—whoever
    that “lucky” person turns out to be.
