    as a singer or an instrument are converted to digital form for recording and editing,
    then converted back to analog for playback. A CD player is a DAC. Your computer
    sound card is an ADC/DAC. An ADC is a crucial piece of equipment. A good one performs
    a good clean accurate conversion without introducing noise. Bad ones sound strange
    and add noise. Some are designed to add some color, for example to sound like
    a certain classic tube amp or recording style from the old days.

    see it; this is what comes out of your speakers and is what you see on your television.
    If we can see it, it can be photographed, and if we can hear it, so can a microphone.
    Of course, making copies in these ways results in lower-quality copies, but it
    shows there is no way to prevent copying by technological means. The industry’s
    efforts to “close the analog hole” have resulted in crippled home entertainment
    receivers that send a purposely degraded signal to the analog outputs or that
    have disabled the analog outputs. This sort of crippling does not differentiate

    is a 24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. Audacity and many other audio recording
    applications and DAWs use 32-bit float internally because the floating decimal
    point allows for a very high level of precision and creates all kinds of extra

    3 dB is about half as loud. The intensity, or amplitude, of a sound is not proportional
