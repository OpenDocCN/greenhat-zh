    first proposed a German-language version of Wikipedia in early 2001\. By May 2001,
    within months of the English-language Wikipedia's founding, Wikipedias had been
    started in Catalan, Chinese, German, French, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Japanese,
    Russian, Portuguese, and Esperanto.

    Languages" below. As of mid-2008, the largest Wikipedias were in English (2.3
    million articles), German (755,000 articles), French (665,000 articles), Polish
    (505,000 articles), and Japanese (494,000 articles). Size alone should not be
    taken as the only criterion of prominence, however. For instance, the Chinese-language
    Wikipedia has often attracted media attention, in part because the Chinese government
    continues to partially limit access to the site within China (as part of the so-called
    Great Firewall of China). Despite this, the Chinese-language Wikipedia has more
    than 178,000 articles, written in large part by the many Chinese editors in Taiwan,
    Hong Kong, and outside East Asia.

    have been started but, at this time, have only a few hundred articles. What function
    do these sites serve? No one could call them a comprehensive encyclopedic resource
    yet. The truth is that they are just beginning wikis—much like the English-language
    Wikipedia in 2001 or 2002\. If you do speak one of these languages fluently enough
    to contribute, working on a smaller Wikipedia can be a great deal of fun. You'll
    find the culture of a small site with few users is very different from the giant
    English-language Wikipedia, which has so many customs, rules, and (obviously)
    so many more articles already written. Even on the small Wikipedias, articles
    are, for the most part, not translations but instead newly written pieces in that
    particular language.

    not many people speak the language, and thus, the potential contributor base is
    small. Alternatively, Wikipedias may exist in widely spoken languages that do
    not have a strong presence on the Internet, such as Telugu, the third-most spoken
    language on the Indian subcontinent and one of the top fifteen spoken languages
    in the world ([Figure 15-2](#the_front_page_of_the_telugu_edition_of_ "Figure 15-2. The
    front page of the Telugu edition of Wikipedia at , from April 2008") shows the
    front page of the Telugu Wikipedia). These languages may not have a strong written
    tradition, or perhaps Internet access is limited in the areas where most native
    speakers live. Some of these Wikipedias quite possibly constitute the largest
    online corpus for their language; in any case, they represent the language online
    in a place where others can easily find it.

    in constructed languages (*Esperanto* [eo] and *Volapük* [vo] with their internationalist
    aim) and significant dead languages (*Latin* [la] and *Old Church Slavonic* [cu]),
    which have no native speakers.^([[33](#ftn.CHP-15-FNOTE-2)]) (The two-letter codes
    are language identifier codes, explained in "Links Between Languages" on [Links
    Between Languages](hw-wkpd-wk_19.html "Links Between Languages")). The issue of
    language preservation, when few native speakers of a smaller language are living,
    is not an explicit Wikimedia Foundation goal. But, on the other hand, providing
    free information to all people in the world, regardless of their language, certainly
    is, and many of the smaller Wikipedias represent the *only* online reference works
    in that language. In some cases, Wikipedia may be the *only encyclopedia* in a
    particular language! Despite this diversity, the 250+ languages already supported
    by Wikimedia come nowhere close to representing all of the world's active languages.
    SIL, creators of the *Ethnologue*, a standard reference work for languages and
    one of the maintainers of the ISO standard for identifying languages, suggests
    the total count of world languages is closer to 5,000.

    this work? The key requirement is that you can provide evidence of a potential
    active user base. Active volunteers for the new Wikipedia will be needed to provide
    the content and watch the wiki for spam and vandalism. Wikipedia has a procedure
    for beginning a new language project, and all new requests must be approved by
    the site developers, who can create the project. Meta, the Wikimedia wiki discussed
    in [Chapter 17](hw-wkpd-wk_21.html "Chapter 17. The Foundation and Project Coordination"),
    has a special page for making these requests. Once a request has been submitted,
    a committee on new language editions, or *langcom*, reviews the request. Someone
    fluent in the language must commit to translating the Mediawiki interface (including
    the text of tabs, buttons, and key pages) for the new project. You can see (and
    participate in) some new projects in the translation process at [http://incubator.wikimedia.org/](http://incubator.wikimedia.org/).

    involved in Wikipedia. Because editors are relatively anonymous, you'll often
    have no idea where your on-wiki friends are from or even their nationality. To
    get around cultural differences, remember the guidelines on interacting politely
    with others online, and don't rely too heavily on regional slang or Internet jargon,
    which not everyone will understand.

    on Wikipedia. Notability is not culture- or language-specific; geographical features,
    important individuals, and other notable regional topics should clearly be included
    in Wikipedia, no matter where they are or relate to in the world.

- en: The *Simple English* Wikipedia is a separate project from the English-language
    Wikipedia. This Wikipedia aims to provide articles in simplified English and is
    designed for people learning English and children. The whole interface has been
    rewritten to use simpler language, so that, for example, the Random Page link
    is the Show Any Page link. Most articles are "translated" from the English-language
    Wikipedia version into shorter, simpler articles. These articles, in turn, can
    be a resource for people working in other languages. Simple English is an ideal
    project for those interested in teaching or learning English as a second language.
    Simple English lives at [http://simple.wikipedia.org/](http://simple.wikipedia.org/),
    and as of mid-2008, had around 33,000 articles.

    WikiProject India, which focuses on writing articles about India, reviewing the
    existing articles about India, and supporting a community portal for editors interested
    in India-related topics. A list of WikiProjects that deal with geographical topics
    can be found at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Geographical]].

    other Wikipedias into English (other-language Wikipedias have similar projects
    that focus on translating articles into their local language). The place to coordinate
    translations in English is [[Wikipedia:Translation]]. Translation offers a double
    challenge: writing good English that is also good Wikipedia content.'

    speakers. Cleanup work on these articles helps make worthwhile material available.
    When evaluating an article according to the criteria laid out in [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html
    "Chapter 4. Understanding and Evaluating an Article"), or in a deletion debate,
    take into account that the article may have been written by a non-native speaker
    with expertise in the topic.

- en: When writing articles in English about topics from non-English speaking parts
    of the world, sources can be problematic. Finding source material in English can
    be much more difficult, for instance. Checking interwiki links to find the relevant
    article on other-language Wikipedias can be helpful for finding sources and more
    information.

- en: Although citing non-English sources is not ideal, you can do this. You can use
    special templates to identify sources in other languages; for instance, placing
    the optional template `{{it icon}}` before a link to an Italian website alerts
    the reader that the source is in Italian (the language codes are the same standard
    ISO codes already mentioned). Citing a source that is not in a Wikipedia's native
    language is better than not citing a source at all. Try to locate English-language
    sources as well, so readers can verify your facts more easily. (If sources in
    different languages disagree, this can be useful information to note and include.)

- en: While English remains the largest single Wikipedia community, less than a quarter
    of the total number of articles across all language Wikipedias are written in
    English. Other languages, taken together, are growing twice as fast as the English-language
    Wikipedia.

- en: Each language Wikipedia includes many original articles and its own unique topics.
    The various sites attract communities, develop their own procedures and customs,
    and sustain themselves over time. The cross-linking (interwiki linking) of corresponding
    articles draws every Wikipedia into a larger network. To truly get a feel for
    the global Wikipedia, spend time in a number of these communities.
