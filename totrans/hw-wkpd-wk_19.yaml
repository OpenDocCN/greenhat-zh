    Wikipedias have been created in over 250 languages, each representing its own

    first proposed a German-language version of Wikipedia in early 2001\. By May 2001,
    within months of the English-language Wikipedia's founding, Wikipedias had been
    started in Catalan, Chinese, German, French, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Japanese,
    Russian, Portuguese, and Esperanto.

    million articles), German (755,000 articles), French (665,000 articles), Polish
    (505,000 articles), and Japanese (494,000 articles). Size alone should not be
    taken as the only criterion of prominence, however. For instance, the Chinese-language
    Wikipedia has often attracted media attention, in part because the Chinese government
    continues to partially limit access to the site within China (as part of the so-called
    Great Firewall of China). Despite this, the Chinese-language Wikipedia has more
    than 178,000 articles, written in large part by the many Chinese editors in Taiwan,
    Hong Kong, and outside East Asia.

    have been started but, at this time, have only a few hundred articles. What function
    do these sites serve? No one could call them a comprehensive encyclopedic resource
    yet. The truth is that they are just beginning wikis—much like the English-language
    Wikipedia in 2001 or 2002\. If you do speak one of these languages fluently enough
    to contribute, working on a smaller Wikipedia can be a great deal of fun. You'll
    find the culture of a small site with few users is very different from the giant
    English-language Wikipedia, which has so many customs, rules, and (obviously)
    so many more articles already written. Even on the small Wikipedias, articles
    are, for the most part, not translations but instead newly written pieces in that
    particular language.

    not many people speak the language, and thus, the potential contributor base is
    small. Alternatively, Wikipedias may exist in widely spoken languages that do
    not have a strong presence on the Internet, such as Telugu, the third-most spoken
    language on the Indian subcontinent and one of the top fifteen spoken languages
    in the world ([Figure 15-2](#the_front_page_of_the_telugu_edition_of_ "Figure 15-2. The
    front page of the Telugu edition of Wikipedia at , from April 2008") shows the
    front page of the Telugu Wikipedia). These languages may not have a strong written
    tradition, or perhaps Internet access is limited in the areas where most native
    speakers live. Some of these Wikipedias quite possibly constitute the largest
    online corpus for their language; in any case, they represent the language online
    in a place where others can easily find it.

    is not an explicit Wikimedia Foundation goal. But, on the other hand, providing
    free information to all people in the world, regardless of their language, certainly
    is, and many of the smaller Wikipedias represent the *only* online reference works

    for beginning a new language project, and all new requests must be approved by

    in [Chapter 17](hw-wkpd-wk_21.html "Chapter 17. The Foundation and Project Coordination"),
    has a special page for making these requests. Once a request has been submitted,
    a committee on new language editions, or *langcom*, reviews the request. Someone
    fluent in the language must commit to translating the Mediawiki interface (including
    the text of tabs, buttons, and key pages) for the new project. You can see (and

    […] Work was limited by the fact that the Klingon vocabulary is closed and incomplete."

    more than one meaning, finding an exact equivalency can sometimes be difficult—take
    care to not link to the wrong concept. Also be careful about linking to disambiguation
    pages, which may exist in one Wikipedia but not another. Obviously, not all articles
    exist in all languages; since the English-language Wikipedia is the largest, it
    often has articles that other languages do not, but you may be surprised at the
    coverage of smaller Wikipedias. If you have created an interwiki link that appears
    to lead nowhere, check to make sure you haven't entered the title incorrectly.

    add an interwiki link back to the first article (for instance, the page [[Hauskatze]]
    should also link to the English [[Cat]]). When creating interwiki links, add a
    simple *+en:* or *interwiki* as an edit summary. You may also find more interwiki
    links to that article to add to the original article you were working on. Today
    bots do much of this missing interwiki linking automatically.

- en: The English-language Wikipedia has a global community of editors, and as an
    editor, you'll regularly collaborate with people from many time zones. A typical
    contributor to the English-language Wikipedia may well be a native speaker in
    an Anglophone country—the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
    and others—but many editors are neither native speakers nor in one of those places.
    Getting to know people from all over the world is one of the benefits of getting
    involved in Wikipedia. Because editors are relatively anonymous, you'll often
    have no idea where your on-wiki friends are from or even their nationality. To
    get around cultural differences, remember the guidelines on interacting politely
    with others online, and don't rely too heavily on regional slang or Internet jargon,
    which not everyone will understand.

    the reader that the source is in Italian (the language codes are the same standard
    ISO codes already mentioned). Citing a source that is not in a Wikipedia's native
    language is better than not citing a source at all. Try to locate English-language
    sources as well, so readers can verify your facts more easily. (If sources in
