- en: MySQL is an open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database management
    system. SQL is the most popular computer language used to interface with relational
    database management systems. A relational database management system (RDBMS) generally
    stores data and their relationships in a table using rows and columns. To be considered
    an RDBMS, the data must also be editable in this format.
