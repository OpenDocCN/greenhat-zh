    process and using your experience—even intuition—to make adjustments. You will
    rarely have the exact information you need to create a highly accurate estimate
    for a project. Part of improving your estimating skills is realizing that you
    will be making many assumptions and guesses, some of which will be wrong. You
    will succeed when your assumptions and guesses are mostly right and when you can
    successfully split the larger processes into smaller pieces to estimate.

    data you need to collect and how you need to assemble it into the estimate. Then

    estimates and data and discuss the project and its requirements with others. Finally,
    you''ll construct the estimate by assembling the pieces of data into a coherent
    picture that lets you determine the amount of time and effort required to finish
    the work.'

    estimate might comprise a short series of steps with an estimated *cost in effort*
    and *cost in calendar days. Cost in effort* refers to the time required to complete
    a task, assuming the worker is devoting all of his time to the task. This is often
    captured in hours or days of work. *Cost in calendar time* refers to the time
    required to complete a task, assuming the employee won't be able to devote all
    of his time to the task because of overhead tasks, company meetings, vacations,
    and sometimes other projects. This is often recorded in calendar days. For example,
    a cost of effort of 20 hours for a person who works 8-hour days and can work on
    the task 60 percent of the time yields 1.5 calendar days (20 hours × 0.6 ÷ 8 hours
    = 1.5 calendar days).

- en: Ideally, the project has been sufficiently divided into tasks that each make
    up no more than 5 to 10 percent of the project duration and last less than two
    weeks. To estimate a project with dozens of tasks to track, you need to split
    apart the project into smaller tasks, understand the assumptions, identify the
    risks, and then assemble the results. Dividing the project into a series of smaller
    tasks improves the accuracy of your estimate, because estimates of time required
    for smaller tasks are more likely to be accurate, as the pieces are easier to
    understand and often relate to previous work for which effort is known. If smaller
    estimates are created properly and without *estimation biases* (discussed later
    in this chapter), they will, on average, be more accurate. Per-task estimates
    that miss the mark on the high or low end tend to average out statistically for
    the entire project if no single estimated component is considerably larger than
    the others. If a single estimated component is considerably larger than the others,
    break it down into smaller tasks and estimate these tasks.

    product it creates. If the business provides many small and similar type jobs,
    an estimating model with a list of choices and a quick summary can work well.
    If the business builds large projects over a period of several months, creating
    a custom spreadsheet for each estimate might be necessary. Another alternative
    for projects with many dependencies is to use a *Gantt chart program*, such as

    back at past projects and use the time required to finish each project step as
    a rough guide for what you'll need for the current project. This approach requires
    that you keep information on past estimates and the amount of time each task actually
    took to implement. Adjust these values only as needed to scale the task to your
    current estimate needs. In addition, consider that historic project data is valuable
    for identifying tasks that didn't get considered in the original estimate.

- en: A second approach to get task estimates is to talk individually to developers
    and ask for their opinions. This approach requires that you engage in multiple
    conversations in which you explain the task and ask for help in creating the estimate.
    Make sure you ask what assumptions the engineer is making (for example, are the
    estimates in calendar time, or is the engineer counting on any specific tools
    or approach?) to ensure that these assumptions match your understanding of the
    efforts required.

    estimation team. This group would meet to create estimates for new projects and

    costs of tasks in that area.

    as a group. With this approach, you can describe each task to everyone and request
    that each participant create an estimate independently. Moving around the table
    and asking for suggestions can provide estimates, but people can show a first
    speaker bias, in which everyone adjusts their numbers to be closer to those of
    the first speaker. Consequently, you can ask that everyone write down his or her
    number and show the estimates at the same time. An alternative is to use a specially
    made estimation deck of cards that team members can use to hold up their estimates
    simultaneously.

    *estimation bias*. Estimation biases have multiple causes. For example, engineers
    are generally optimistic, especially about tasks they *want* to do. On the other
    hand, they might forget about a few mundane details. Since estimates turn into
    schedules by which the engineers are judged, some engineers will pad time estimates—as
    a matter of human nature. Another common bias is estimating more time required
    for tasks that an engineer doesn't want to do, especially if he or she believes
    the solution is technically inferior. Finally, some engineers might not be interested
    in estimation and will spend too little time thinking through what is involved.

    factor to account for past biases. For some engineers' estimates, the multiplier

    a destination, decide who is going with you, figure out the costs, determine how
    you'll get there, plan for the unexpected, and finally take the first step out
    the door. With a project, you define the goal, assemble a team, set the priorities,
    create a plan, prepare for risks, define the framework for carrying out the project,

    with the technology required for the project, or whether he or she will need to
    spend time learning it. If a candidate needs to learn, can you build this into
    the project costs and timeline and still deliver a successful project on time?

    section of the code that can be evaluated on its own when the work is accomplished).
    First, the replacement engineer doesn't have the same level of project identification
    as the full-time team member, which can lead to low-quality work. Second, the
    substitute engineer doesn't have the full-product perspective. He or she might
    make assumptions that can cause problems that are discovered only later. Finally,
    many engineers find it easier to rewrite others' work than to spend time understanding
    it, leading to wasted effort—which sometimes occurs twice, if the original engineer
    returns to the project and reinstates the original code.

    of the project to the new engineer in detail and walk through the specific deliverable
    with the engineer. Having another kickoff meeting with the entire team can be
    very effective—it allows the team to describe project status, open issues, and

    or problems, you might be tempted to ignore a forecast of late delivery because
    a particular due date has not yet arrived. You might convince yourself into thinking
    you can still make the deadline. Or perhaps you decided that a task will take
    only half the time it normally takes, just to make the plan look good on paper
    (and to make yourself feel better). If you haven't come up with a realistic plan
    for reducing the time for the effort, don't fool yourself. Take the opportunity

    team's status—in the worst cases, this deception continues up until the software
    is due to be delivered. This results in a huge impact due to delays, with little
    chance to resolve serious problems. Instead, as the project progresses, you must
    provide factual information to those who have a stake in your project's outcome,
    including management and the development team.

    their success can depend on your meeting your rollout promises. Waiting until

    approach uses a *Gantt chart* that lets you graphically track a project's progress
    against your original plan and predict a schedule outcome. As illustrated in [Figure 14-1](ch14s02.html#simple_gantt_chart
    "Figure 14-1. Simple Gantt chart"), a Gantt chart uses horizontal bars that each
    represent the length of time required for a task shown at the left. Arrows connecting
    bars are called *dependencies*. A dependent task requires the completion of an
    earlier task before it can start. In this example, the pizza must be delivered
    and the table set before dinner can be eaten. Diamonds are used to mark milestones—in
    this case, the diamond marks that dinner is over.

    a moderate number of parallel tasks are required to complete the project. As Gantt
    charts typically allow for only simple calculations, they are not appropriate
    if you need more complex numeric analyses, such as the ability to track multiple
    ranges of outcomes or base times for events on formulas.

    started late, move the task start to reflect the reality of what happened. If
    a step took more or less time, change the bar length to reflect that. If a staffing
    assignment changes, reflect this in the chart.

    you can use the chart to communicate status. In addition, the Gantt continually
    predicts the future end dates of the project during development, based on dates
    and deadlines already passed along with your current best estimates. Good predictions
    help you plan for the future (or change a potential outcome before it happens)
    by adding staff, removing features, or sometimes rearranging tasks. Finally, the
    Gantt stores project history, which is especially useful after the project is
    complete, during improvement reviews. In addition, you can use this information
    to create estimates for new projects in the future and to compare how engineers
    performed on their estimates versus actual delivery times.

    or continuous time estimates. As discussed in [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. PROJECT
    ESTIMATING"), a *calendar-day estimate* incorporates any non-project time expected
    for the person doing the work. In making an estimate, the engineer accounts for
    other tasks and overhead tasks required during the week in addition to the task
    at hand. So if the estimate is for five days, the engineer is accounting for not
    only time directly working on the task, but time for overhead tasks and work on
    other projects.

    task. Work hours are the actual hours required to complete the task if the engineer
    were working on the task full time. To create this estimate, use a multiplier
    to convert work hours into calendar days. The multiplier accounts for overhead
    and other tasks that prevent a worker from spending 100 percent of his time on
    only assigned tasks. Software company overhead percentages can vary, but a common
    number is 30 percent, which leads to a multiplier of 1 ÷ (1 - 0.30) = 1.42\. See

    estimates added as required to complete the project (from the Left column), as
    shown for Projected Date 1\. Alternatively, you can calculate the end date based
    on the project start date, plus the spent time, plus the estimate for time remaining
    (from the Left column, or column D) until the project is complete, as shown in
    Projected Date 2\. The Projected Date 1 approach will shift the end date as you
    check the worksheet daily unless you continually update the Left column values
    or type in today's date as a number instead of using the `today()` function. The
    Projected Date 2 approach will not shift daily but can accumulate small errors

    status throughout the project effort. If you construct a model, it can be combined
    with project status information to predict future outcomes. If you don't like
    the outcomes, you can make changes to your project by asking *what if* questions
    through your model. Change happens in most projects—staff changes, requirements
    change, and new opportunities and problems arise. A good model lets you deal with
    change rather than being buffeted by it.

    to make changes to improve the outcome. You can identify improvements through
    *what if* calculations—What if I remove a task? What if I add a feature? What

    the change makes sense and gets the plan closer to the desired goal.

    tasks will often leave you with an unbalanced set of assignments—that is, some
    engineers will be done with their assignments while others are still toiling away.
    Some rebalancing of workload can help, and you can use a simple approach to see

    some later steps to begin before the team has completed earlier steps. Most modified
    waterfalls provide monitored feedback loops so that when people find a problem
    while tackling one step, they can rework an earlier step to help fix it. For example,
    if the team detects a definition problem in the design step, the team reopens
    the definition step to work on it. Modified waterfalls usually define what to
    do in the feedback loops to keep the effort from turning into chaos. [Figure 15-2](ch15s02.html#simple_modified_waterfall_process

    about a year to complete each product. On my first effort, my manager told me
    to add features iteratively after creating the skeleton of the program. As I got

    the system, and to add support throughout the system.

    uses fixed-length release cycles called *sprints* that are usually 30 days long.
    At the start of the cycle, the team negotiates the definition for the sprint.
    A *Scrum master* holds daily standup meetings and creates specific reports showing
    progress of the work toward completion. The team builds functioning code daily.
    When projected delivery exceeds the sprint length, the scrum master decreases
    the functionality until the team can meet the original delivery date. If marketing
    determines that the functionality must change, then the sprint resets and the
    team starts a new sprint. Scrum also uses specific project management methods
    during the cycle, which include daily reviews and specific reports.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scrum has the benefit of fixing the maximum functionality along with fixing
    the timeline at the beginning of the cycle. The functionality planned does not
    increase or change during a sprint, but the Scrum master can reduce it to fit
    the time available. The staff size remains constant for a cycle. Having potential
    variables fixed up front makes a Scrum process predictable.

    spend time understanding the core issues. Processes usually require enforcement,
    which can mean talking to people when the process isn't followed to understand
    what happened. (You may need to modify the process if problems are uncovered.)
    Without enforcement, some people will skip steps to wait to see if any repercussions
    follow. Ensuring that the team follows the process is key to its success.

    when working with short development cycles and firm delivery dates, a significant
    process change can be risky. However, if the process is seriously broken or would

    improvement programs took too much time and offered too few results. Some larger

    attempt to improve the process can result in political maneuvering, unnecessary

    the step is complete. Parallel tasks can also be calculated to the side of the

    items as a single process step. For the entire process step, the minimum total

    in 2.5 days. Your goal is to look at the typical cases and determine what reductions
    you can make. For typical cases, look at decision points and determine whether
    you can reduce the percentage for the slower decisions. In this case, can you

    ask sales to give their responses in 4 hours on average, the time drops to 3.2

    most of the delay is caused by the availability of the manager and not the total

    improvements can be greater. If improving the overall process requires work shifting
    or reduction from someone other than an engineer, a development manager can lose
    perspective on the other team member's needs in the workflow. Instead of simply
    making requests, involve people outside your team in discussing process improvements
    and the impacts on their work. Negotiate for changes you would like others to
    make and be flexible in requests made of you. You might discover that changes
    in your team's steps can greatly ease the efforts for other groups.

    of the company's software product. Effective QA requires much more than simply
    testing new products, however. As discussed in earlier chapters, QA teams should

    As customers continue to pour more requirements into the development mix, and
    as the company grows, the development manager faces challenges other than simply
    insuring that the team implements the new features. In fact, an exclusive focus
    on implementing new features is a trap that can make a manager lose focus on important,
    core issues. Continually adding new features and ignoring core issues is comparable
    to adding new floors to a building that has a weak foundation.

    of the bigger picture, the result will be a poor-quality product. Engineers might
    produce more features rapidly, but the features aren't as quality built as they
    should be, and the product and customer will suffer. Lack of quality critically
    affects small companies and development departments, as old issues take up time
    that should be spent for ongoing development. Quality problems can consume huge
    amounts of the development and QA teams' time.

    customer and is working on a groundbreaking new product, but as the customer list
    grows, past quality issues will come back to haunt you. They can also lead the
    company into a *crisis mentality*, where each new customer crisis results in the
    team scrambling to patch together a solution. Poor-quality products lead to lost
    sales and drive existing customers to other companies' products. Once customers
    label your company and its product's quality as poor, you will find it difficult
    to change their impressions.

    a *feature change*? From a development perspective, an issue can look like a feature
    change, while the customer sees the same issue as an obvious defect.'

    keeping track of prerelease and post-release defects is very important, other
    aspects of quality should also be examined, such as accurate requirements, elegant
    design, utility, and long-term customer satisfaction. Finally, defects are only
    detected by way of focused efforts to locate them. Without a focused QA effort

    defects or because the product does not meet the customer's expectations. In fact,
    products with a large number of defects found and repaired are often still plagued
    with more defects yet to be found. Extensive testing of high-quality products
    often results in fewer defects, because they were built with quality in mind by
    a development team that used good design, best development practices, careful
    code construction, and attention to quality. A great QA team can assist by encouraging
    positive practices, providing valuable feedback, helping instill an attitude of

    to think about quality as an *attitude* rather than simply a product goal or state.
    Building a "quality attitude" among members of the development team improves quality
    more than even the best QA practices. Why? Because having an attitude that values
    quality from the start will encourage the development team to build a quality
    product by getting clear requirements and by spending time understanding those
    requirements—through thoughtful design and with careful coding and review. In
    contrast, quickly coded solutions that are only polished through limited testing
    and repair will result in a product with poor quality baked in.

    to success in many small firms. A development team cannot maintain a focus on
    quality if its products continue to be defective. Focus on fixing existing problems
    built into the product. Depending on the extent of the problems, you might be
    able to set aside time during a longer release cycle to undergo extensive bug
    repairs. If the problems are too extensive for a single release, schedule major
    defect repairs (sometimes called "bug scrubs") for the next few releases.

    Test automation makes sense when the product is stable enough that repeatable
    testing is cost effective. For startups with rapidly changing products, test automation
    may not be effective because of the cost of maintaining a rapidly changing product.
    As the company enters the foothold and growth phases, test automation can be more
    practical and its value increases considerably. Automation can increase test accuracy
    while significantly reducing testing time.

    and compare the resulting outputs against past results. Differences in results
    do not necessarily indicate an error in the code; differences can be caused by
    intended changes in the code since the last regression results were stored, for
    example. When QA has reviewed all the results for accuracy, the outputs are saved
    as the correct values for later comparisons.

    be for your product, evaluate the rate of change in the automation output per
    release versus the cost of maintaining the scripts. If more than 20 percent of
    the automation output changes per release, the product may not be a good candidate
    for script automation.

    (a software framework to simplify the creation, running, and evaluation of unit
    tests) is used to test internal sections of the code. Often, the engineering team
    creates the unit tests and continues to maintain them. Test harnesses are worthwhile
    even if the GUI and features in code are changing, because maintaining them is
    not as expensive as maintaining external testing efforts. Test harnesses isolate
    code sections, many of which will not change per release. JUnit ([http://www.junit.org](http://www.junit.org))

    business impact. Ranking scales vary considerably from company to company, with
    some choosing alphabetic ranking, some choosing text (such as Very Severe), and
    some using numeric ranking. The problem with a technique that uses multiple scales

    The *return-per-cost (RPC)* of effort allows you to rank different defects. RPC
    is a calculation of benefits that requires you to assign benefit values to ranking
    numbers. In this example, a rank 5 defect is twice as important as a rank 4\.
    A rank 4 defect is twice as important as a rank 3\. A rank 3 is twice as important
    as a rank 2\. And a rank 2 defect is 1.5 times as important as a rank 1\. This
    example assigns a rank 1 defect a value of 10 so that you can set up a relationship

    simple 1- and 2-ranked defects are good choices to implement first if their costs

    of change in a release can't be based merely on lines of code written. Sometimes
    changes take considerable effort, and the effort involves refactoring existing
    code. A practical normalization approach is to use an approximate calculation
    of number of hours of development effort planned for the release. If a release
    has twice as many engineering hours planned as the last release, for example,
    use 2 as the normalization factor—divide defect counts by 2 to compare these against
    data from the last release.

    or lower. A 5 percent (1 failure in 20) organization is performing very well indeed:
