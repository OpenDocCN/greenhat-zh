Well, you will be happy to know that using your device on your Ubuntu system is quite easy—easier than ever before. No longer do you have to mess around with mount and unmount commands or edit system tables, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, consider yourself lucky. Just plug in your device, and Ubuntu will do the rest.</p><div class="sect1" title="Knowing Your Limits"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="knowing_your_limits"/>Knowing Your Limits</h1></div></div></div><p>Assuming you downloaded and installed the recommended audio codecs mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. TUX ROCKS">Chapter 14</a>, you shouldn't encounter any problems handling music or podcasts on your digital media device in Ubuntu. Even if you didn't install them, Ubuntu should automatically help you find the necessary items if you try to play a file it doesn't support out of the box. Nevertheless, not all formats will work with equal degrees of comfort or success—it depends on your device and the file format's compatibility with Ubuntu. As a general rule of thumb, most players will be able to handle MP3 files and unlocked AAC (<span class="emphasis"><em>.m4a</em></span>) files. Check your device's manual for specifics about other file formats (or just give them a try).<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1291" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1292" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1293" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1294" class="indexterm"/></p><p>As far as Ubuntu goes, it can work with all the file formats mentioned with the exception of locked AAC files, but you will learn how to deal with this later in the chapter.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Although working with your digital media devices in Ubuntu has become increasingly simple, it is still a relatively new procedure.

Basically, just plug it in via a USB connector, and Ubuntu will mount the device so you can access it. An icon for your device will then appear on the desktop (<a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#ubuntu_instantly_recognizes_your_ipod_or" title="Figure 15-1. Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone.">Figure 15-1</a>) and in the left pane of any Nautilus window you happen to have open. Two of those what-do-you-want-me-to-do-with-this-stuff type of windows that appear when you insert a music CD or DVD into your drive or connect a digital camera to your machine via USB cable—one for the music and podcasts on your device and one for the photos (also shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#ubuntu_instantly_recognizes_your_ipod_or" title="Figure 15-1. Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone.">Figure 15-1</a>)—will also appear, usually one directly above the other. By default, Ubuntu will point you to Rhythmbox for music-handling chores and to F-Spot for photo handling, both of which will be discussed later in the chapter. Click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> in each window to accept Ubuntu's choices.</p><p>To "eject" your iPod or iPhone, either right-click the desktop icon for the device and select <span class="strong"><strong>Eject</strong></span> or, from a Nautilus window, click the eject button next to the icon for your device in the side pane of the window.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ubuntu_instantly_recognizes_your_ipod_or"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject15_d1e20160"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656571.png.jpg" alt="Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-1. Ubuntu instantly recognizes your iPod or iPhone.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="(Not) Auto-updating Your iPod or iPhone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="open_parenthesis_not_close_parenthesis_a"/>(Not) Auto-updating Your iPod or iPhone</h1></div></div></div><p>With the simple instructions as to how to use your iPod or iPhone with Ubuntu out of the way, it's worth thinking about a couple of other things. Most important of these is the device's auto-updating settings. When you enable auto-update on your iPod or iPhone via iTunes, the function is set up within the device itself. You can use your iPod in Windows, Mac OS, or Linux—or all of them interchangeably. If you set up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, however, you are leaving yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection on all of your machines.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1295" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1296" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The reason for this is simple. Although iTunes allows you to add files to your iPod, it does not allow you to copy files from it. The auto-update feature is thus strictly a one-way street. This means that whenever you hook up your auto-update–enabled iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will automatically add the tracks in its library to your iPod; more frighteningly, it will remove any tracks from your iPod that are not present in that machine's iTunes library. I learned this the hard way when I took my wife's loaded iPod to work and plugged it into my office Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library. When I brought the little Podster back home to her with nothing at all on it, well . . . what ensued wasn't pretty.</p><p>Make sure to disable your iPod's auto-update function before bringing the device into the Linux world. To do this, connect your iPod to your Mac or Windows machine, and open iTunes. In the left pane of the iTunes window, click your iPod in the Devices section, and then in the <span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span> tab in the right pane, check the box next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Manually manage music</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>Manually manage music and videos</em></span> in video-capable iPods), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15s03.html#disabling_the_auto-update_function_on_yo" title="Figure 15-2. Disabling the auto-update function on your iPhone/iPod in iTunes">Figure 15-2</a>. Next, if you have a photo-capable device, repeat nearly the same process for your photos by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Photos</strong></span> tab in the right pane and then unchecking the box next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>Sync photos from</em></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="disabling_the_auto-update_function_on_yo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject15_d1e20203"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656573.png.jpg" alt="Disabling the auto-update function on your iPhone/iPod in iTunes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-2. Disabling the auto-update function on your iPhone/iPod in iTunes</p></div></div>

As I have already shown, Android-based phones are also quite popular, and there are still other devices, ranging from simple $15 USB MP3 players to the Linux-based Palm Pre cellular phone.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1301" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1302" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1303" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1304" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1305" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1306" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1307" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1308" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1309" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1310" class="indexterm"/></p><p>How to work with these devices in Ubuntu can vary by device, but for the most part, they should work either in the same manner as an iPod or Android device or in the same manner as a USB data device. The Palm Pre, which uses a Linux-based operating system, works in Ubuntu in the same way as the iPhone, while the $19 generic MP3 player I bought at Office Depot acts like a USB thumb drive. The simplest way to see how your device will work is to connect it to your computer via a USB cable. If windows asking you how to deal with the device do not appear, open a Nautilus window to see whether you find an icon for the device there. If so, you can work with your device using the tried-and-true drag-and-drop method. You can also use Rhythmbox to work with the audio files on your generic device by doing the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Create a <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder if there isn't one already on the device.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Music</strong></span> folder, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Open with Other Application</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Open with window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Rhythmbox</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch15s06.html#selecting_rhythmbox_as_the_application_t" title="Figure 15-4. Selecting Rhythmbox as the application to use when working with the audio files on your generic MP3 player">Figure 15-4</a>), and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div>

Luckily, Rhythmbox allows you to do this quite easily.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1311" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1312" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1313" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1314" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1315" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1316" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1317" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1318" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1319" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To copy music from your iPhone/iPod, Android based phone, or other digital media device with Rhythmbox, select the tracks you want to export (hold down the <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span> key to make multiple selections, or use the tabs to select whole artists or genres if you like), and drag the selected items to your desktop, music folder, or wherever you want them. The only catch with this seemingly simple approach is that when copying files from an iPod/iPhone, you end up with files on your hard disk with funky filenames, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>ZPAD.m4a</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>ATDT.mp3</em></span>, rather than the name that appeared on your iPhone/iPod or within Rhythmbox. This means you'll have to rename the files once they have been transferred to your hard disk, which isn't much of a chore unless you're dealing with lots and lots of files or if you just forget which file is which. In case of the latter, right-click the file, click <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span> tab, where you will find the original filename (<a class="xref" href="ch15s06.html#finding_the_file_properties_of_a_mislabe" title="Figure 15-6. Finding the file properties of a mislabeled audio file">Figure 15-6</a>).

It is most likely that your iPod is formatted in Apple's native HFS+ filesystem, although this in itself is not a problem. The problem is that HFS+ formatted iPods have journaling enabled. <span class="emphasis"><em>Journaling</em></span> is an HFS+ feature that acts to protect the filesystem from damage due to power surges, power failures, or hardware breakdowns.</p><p>As fate would have it, however, the Linux kernel doesn't deal well with journaling-enabled, HFS+ formatted devices. Fortunately, the tweak to fix this is quite simple, and it isn't even particularly geeky: You just have to disable journaling on your iPod.</p><p>Disabling journaling on an HFS+ formatted iPod is a very easy task if you have a Mac nearby. Just plug your iPod into a Mac, close iTunes when it automatically opens, and then run Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder). When Disk Utility opens, select your iPod (by name) in the left pane of the window, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>option</strong></span> key, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Disable Journaling</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu. After a moment, journaling on your iPod will be disabled without any loss of data. If you connect your iPod to your Linux machine again, you will be able to use it more or less like normal.</p></div>

If Rhythmbox was running while the installation process was taking place, however, you will need to restart it before it will be able to handle the files.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ubuntu_lets_you_know_what_plug-ins_it_fi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject15_d1e20688"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656591.png.jpg" alt="Ubuntu lets you know what plug-ins it finds to allow you to play locked AAC files."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 15-11. Ubuntu lets you know what plug-ins it finds to allow you to play locked AAC files.</p></div></div>

Now, I am not advocating that you do this (and I most certainly have not done so myself), but some folks are interested in geeking around with whatever gadget they have in their hands. If you're such a person or if you're just curious, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ipodlinux.org/">http://www.ipodlinux.org/</a>, or the even more popular Rockbox (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.rockbox.org/">http://www.rockbox.org/</a>), which also runs on a number of other, non-Apple, devices.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1331" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-15-1332" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

Your iPad?</h1></div></div></div><p>Apple's newest offering, the iPad, has been on the shelves only a short time, and yet Linux enthusiasts are already trying the iPad out with Linux machines. Reports are that the iPad "mostly" works as of the current version, Ubuntu 10.04. If you want to see how the iPad works with your Ubuntu-powered PC, just connect the two by USB cable, and play around to see how it goes. Just remember that you're doing so at your own risk.<a id="IDX-CHP-15-1333" class="indexterm"/></p></div></body></html>
