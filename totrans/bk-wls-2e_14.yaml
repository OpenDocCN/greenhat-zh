    running full-size operating systems. Palms, BlackBerries, Pocket PCs, iPhones,
    and other handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) can all use wireless links
    to synchronize data with other computers, send and receive email, and download
    data from the Internet. This new category of hybrid devices automatically switches

    that can store and play music and video, and GPS receivers that offer driving

    away from your own home or office, when you want to send and receive email or
    text messages, or when you want to consult an online information source. The combination
    of a telephone, a camera, a text and voice recorder, a music player, an Internet
    appliance, and a small general-purpose computer in a convenient pocket-size package
    is a huge advance in the way people use technology. Fifty years ago, having all
    that technology in your pocket was inconceivable; even 5 or 10 years ago it would
    have required half a dozen separate devices (and of course, 50 years from now

    service provider whose network you want to use. You can either choose the model
    you want and look for a service provider that supports it, or you can select a

    have squeezed a lot of program icons and other information into a tiny space.
    This can make it considerably more difficult to operate a handheld device than
    a full-size computer with a big screen, a mouse, and a keyboard. Of course, there's
    usually a learning curve that will make any device easier to use over time, but
    it's still important to try more than one of them before you buy. "Easy to use"
    is a subjective call that will not be the same for everyone. Some people will
    be happier with the iPhone's touch screen, while others will prefer a BlackBerry's
    keyboard or a simple keypad on a Windows Mobile or Symbian device. Your best bet
    is to visit one or more retail stores and compare several phones with different
    operating systems, different feature sets, and different physical layouts.

    coverage in all the places you expect to use the device? Of course, some smartphones
