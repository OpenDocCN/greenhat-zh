- en: If we have a paper width of 8.5 inches and use 1 inch for margins (1/2 inch
    each side), how much usable space do we have left? Anyone can see that the result

    to commend you. Ever since this project began, we''ve had daily visits from Bill
    (the head of marketing). Every day he comes in, plays with the software, and then
    insists on changes. But in the past week, he''s spent all his time playing Adventure,
    giving him no time to make change requests. I just wanted to thank you for keeping
    him out of my hair."'
