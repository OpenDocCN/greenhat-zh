</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When notebook computers first came out,  the greatest thing about them was that they  freed people from their desks. People could  do whatever they needed or wanted to do on  their computer, wherever they wanted. As a  cross-legged-on-the-floor kind of guy, a laptop was really  great for me, as I could plop it down on the floor in front  of the TV, and then sit there writing and gaming while  playing my copy of <i class="calibre11">Wall Street</i> for the umpteenth time on  the VCR. Yes, everything was great, but then came the  Internet. Laptops suddenly became tethered to telephone  lines and Ethernet cables.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fortunately, laptops have been unleashed again as the computer world goes  wireless. With the right wireless hardware, you can now use your computer just about  anywhere you can catch a wave, so to speak. Whether you happen to be at your </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">breakfast table, on your backyard deck, in the library of your university, or at your  local Starbucks, you can now go online without having to physically hook your  computer up to anything. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Whether or not you should join the fray and go wireless is still primarily a  question of personal choice and need. For example, if you don’t have a laptop,  there is little reason to bother, as you can’t really move a desktop computer  around easily; and the fact that Linux support for desktop wireless hardware is  not really ready for prime time doesn’t help matters. If, on the other hand, you  have a laptop that you would like to use while sitting in the Santa Fe Depot in San  Diego waiting for your train to L.A., or while sitting in your hotel room looking  for things to do during your vacation in Seattle, or while sitting on your front  porch taking in a bit of sun, then why not go for it? Whether you are ready to  commit, still considering, or just plain curious, read on. . . .</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get up to speed in the wireless world, you should first be aware of the three  wireless protocols commonly in use today: 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, which  are collectively referred to as <i class="calibre11">Wi-Fi</i> (short for wireless fidelity). In case you are  wondering, a <i class="calibre11">protocol</i> is basically a data transmission format that has been  generally agreed upon, in this case by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE). Of these three 802.11 protocols, average home users need  only concern themselves with 802.11b and 802.11g, as the hardware for these  protocols is considerably less expensive than that for 802.11a, which is primarily  used in large office environments.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The faster of the two protocols is 802.11g, which has a transmission speed of  54 Mbps compared to the 11 Mbps speed of 802.11b. Linux support for 802.11g  wireless cards, however, is still developmental at best, which means that for now  you had better stick to the 11 Mbps 802.11b protocol when selecting a wireless  card. Although this may sound like an undesirable limitation, it is pretty much  irrelevant in the real-world scheme of things. The somewhat lower speed of the  802.11b devices will most likely matter very little to you unless you are forking out  an awful lot of money to your Internet provider each month for some extreme  bandwidth. After all, the average transmission speed of most home cable Internet  connections is still less than the 11 Mbps speed of 802.11b, so don’t fret too  much. Just remember that a traditional dial-up telephone modem has a  transmission speed of 56 Kbps, or 56<i class="calibre11"> thousand</i> bits per second; 11 Mbps is 11  <i class="calibre11">million</i> bits per second. That is plenty fast for the average mortal.<a name="809" id="809"/><a name="IDX-252" id="IDX-252"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another reason you shouldn’t feel so hampered by having to use an 802.11b  wireless card is that the 802.11b protocol is still more commonly used than the  newer 802.11g. Most public wireless access areas <i class="calibre11">(hot spots)</i>, such as airports,  university campuses, and hotels still use the 802.11b protocol. Even if the 802.11g  protocol is used in such places, or even if someone in your family has an 802.11g- based system up and running in your house, you can still connect to the Net over that system with your 802.11b network card, because the two protocols are  compatible (though your 802.11b card won’t be able to use the extra speed of  the 802.11g network). </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To create your own home Wi-Fi setup, you need at least two pieces of hardware: a  wireless access point (WAP) and a wireless network interface card (NIC), both of  which you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU183">Figure 18-1</a>. These two devices act like a pair of transceivers,  communicating with each other via radio signals rather than over a wired  connection. The WAP transmits data it receives from the Internet source device  (such as your cable or ADSL modem) and receives data transmitted by your  computer’s NIC. The NIC, for its part, receives transmitted data from the WAP  and transmits data from the computer back to the WAP.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The basic differences between a wired and wireless Internet connection setup  can be seen in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU184">Figure 18-2</a> on the next page. In the typical wired setup, a cable  from your high-speed Internet source device is directly connected to your  computer by an Ethernet cable. If you are using a cable modem, for example,  you would have an Ethernet cable going from your cable modem directly into  the Ethernet port of your computer. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In a Wi-Fi setup, the Ethernet cable connects your Internet source device  directly to the wireless access point, rather than to your computer. The wireless  NIC is connected to your computer. This is frequently a PC Card, which you  plug into one of the PCMCIA ports on your laptop (or into a special adapter  on desktops). The NIC and access point then communicate with each other via radio waves rather than a hard wire connection — a sort of virtual wire, if  you like.<a name="814" id="814"/><a name="IDX-253" id="IDX-253"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you want to set up a wireless system in your home or office, the first thing you  will need to get is a wireless access point. Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not  really much of an issue in this department because the access point doesn’t  physically interface with your computer. In addition, as your 802.11b wireless  NIC will work with access points using either the 802.11b or 802.11g protocols, it  doesn’t really matter what kind of wireless access point you choose. This is not to  say that you needn’t pay attention to what you are getting, though. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While whatever Wi-Fi access point you use should work right out of the box  without the need for any special settings, there are a number of settings that you  might want to consider specifying, especially for security reasons. For example,  you may wish to restrict access to your wireless access point to certain hardware  devices so that someone parked out on the street can’t access your network. Each  piece of hardware <i class="calibre11">(node)</i> on a network has its own unique ID, referred to as a  <i class="calibre11">MAC</i> (Media Access Control) <i class="calibre11">address</i>. If you want to make sure that only your  wireless NIC can access your WAP, you can do so in your WAP settings by  specifying your wireless card’s MAC address.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can usually change the WAP settings by opening a Web browser and  then punching up the IP address of the wireless access point, which is generally  printed somewhere in the user’s manual. This will present you with a Web page  in which you can change or input the various settings. As Web browsers are not  native to any one system, changing your settings with a Linux machine is no  different from changing the settings with a machine running another operating  system. <a name="816" id="816"/><a name="IDX-254" id="IDX-254"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, a few WAPs require you to use Internet Explorer to handle such  browser-based settings, and because a Linux version of Internet Explorer does not exist, you will find yourself stuck unless you have a Mac or Windows machine  to complete the job. Worse yet is the fact that some WAPs do not support browser-based settings at all. Instead, they require you to install special Windows  software to do the job. When selecting hardware for your wireless setup, it is  obviously best to stay clear of this sort of WAP.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Whether you set up a home or office wireless access point, or you only need to access public WAPs (like at Starbucks), your machine will need a wireless NIC.  Because these cards plug directly into your system, you must find and use a card  that is Linux-compatible. Fedora Core comes with several wireless drivers built in,  so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those drivers, all will be smooth  sailing for you. Most wireless NICs are PC Cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot  on the side of your laptop computer (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU185">Figure 18-3</a>). </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Unfortunately, built-in Linux support is still pretty much limited to wireless NICs  of the PC Card variety. Although there are also NICs that plug into one of your  machine’s USB ports or PCI slots, the drivers available for such devices do not  come with your Linux system. Therefore, I don’t really recommend using a non- PC-Card NIC, because adding a driver to Linux is not the simple slip-in-the-CD- and-double-click procedure that it can be on other systems. In fact, adding a  driver to Linux involves mucking around with the Linux kernel itself, which is a  cumbersome and even daunting process, especially for a beginner. Most drivers  eventually make their way into future releases of the Linux kernel, so I strongly  recommend sticking to hardware that is supported by the drivers included with  your system.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you would like to find out a bit more about the state of Linux wireless  support, there is an excellent site that you will be pointed to by almost everyone  you ask about such things: <a target="_top" href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/">www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/</a> Wireless.html. As you will soon find out, the only problem with the site is that  there is so much information that you may end up being more confused than  when you started out. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Rather than baffling yourself needlessly, it is probably better to just look at  what wireless NICs are supported by the drivers included in Fedora Core. The  following list is taken directly from the configuration files in Fedora Core, so  choosing a card from any of the following lists should ensure compatibility.<a name="820" id="820"/><a name="IDX-256" id="IDX-256"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite the large number of cards listed, you should be aware that many of these  are no longer manufactured, while several others are now sold under different  names, either through Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) arrangements  or because of corporate mergers or acquisitions. If you already have one of the  listed cards, you can try it out easily enough by simply plugging it in and seeing  how things go by following the setup steps in the following <a href="DDU0137.html#821" target="_parent">“Setting Up Your  Wireless Card”</a> section. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you already have a card but it is not listed above, you might want to check  it too, because it might be one of those supported cards under a different brand  or model label. You can find out your card’s make and model by using<b class="calibre13"> cardctl</b>(a PCMCIA card control utility). To do this, insert your wireless NIC into the </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">PCMCIA slot of your computer, open a Terminal window, become root by using  the <b class="calibre13">su </b>command, and then type <span>/sbin/cardctl ident</span> and press ENTER. The actual  hardware make and model of the card will then appear in the Terminal window. If it matches one of those listed, you can be pretty sure that it is going to work.  If not, you can still go through the setup steps in the following section to see what  happens.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are going to go out and buy a card and do not want to waste your hard- earned cash experimenting, you will want to check things out more thoroughly.  As always, a direct call for advice on one of the many Linux lists would be a good  way to get such advice. I took a look at the archives of the Fedora_List mailing list  and came up with a few reports of cards that were said to work “out of the box,”  without the need for any special drivers. I then punched up those devices on  froogle.google.com to see what was still available (and in what price range).  These included the Dell Truemobile 1150 ($39 to $49), the Compaq WL 110 ($110 to $200), and the Netgear MA401 ($42 to $65). The Cisco 350 was also  mentioned as working without a hitch for some, but it was also a source of grief  for others. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Not mentioned anywhere on the list (at least not where I could find it) was  the Buffalo AirStation WLI-PCM-L11GP ($43 to $61), which is the card I’ve been  using for some time now without a hitch. Although the card, as labeled, does not  appear on the previous compatibility lists, performing a check with cardctl  revealed that the card is telling my machine it is a Melco WLI-PCM-L11, which is  on the list, so looks can be deceiving — even in the computer world.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="822" id="822"/><a name="IDX-257" id="IDX-257"/>Setting up a Linux-compatible wireless PC Card is relatively simple. It is probably best, though not essential, to go through the setup process in the vicinity of a  wireless access point so that you know that you’ve succeeded. Therefore, if you  have your own WAP at home or in the office, connect your WAP to your Internet  source, and then turn the WAP on. If you are only going to be using public  WAPs, perform the setup process on your next visit to Starbucks or another  wireless hot spot.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’re within reach of a WAP that is up and running, plug your  wireless NIC into the PCMCIA slot on your computer. Almost immediately after  doing that, you should hear two beeps, which tells you that all is going to be well.  Any LEDs on the card may light up at this time. If not, they will do so after you finish configuring the card. If you hear only one beep after inserting the card,  then it is most likely not compatible with any of the preinstalled drivers.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your machine does not allow you to hear system beeps or other sounds for  some reason, or if you’re just the double-checking kind, you can visually check to  see whether or not the drivers for your card have been loaded by using the <b class="calibre13">lsmod </b>(list loaded modules) command. To do this, open a new Terminal window, type  in <span>/sbin/lsmod</span>, and then press ENTER. The results should look something like  those in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU186">Figure 18-4</a> on the next page. The driver for your card (<b class="calibre13"><span>orinoco_cs</span></b> in the  example) should appear near the top of the list and also next to <b class="calibre13"><span>pcmcia_core</span></b>. Of  course, your card may use one of the other drivers listed earlier, so your results  may be considerably different.<a name="823" id="823"/><a name="IDX-258" id="IDX-258"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you have configured your wireless NIC, you need to activate it in order  to use it, and there are two ways to do this. As you were warned when setting up  the card, though, you may have to restart your computer before you can use your  new device, so if your card doesn’t work immediately when you activate it, restart  your computer and try again. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The more traditional way of activating a wireless card is essentially a point- and-click approach, utilizing the Network Device Control window. To open the  window, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">System Tools </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Network Device  Control</b>. Once the Network Device Control window opens (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU191">Figure 18-9</a> on  the next page), you can conveniently activate and deactivate your configured  network devices without having to enter root mode. To activate your device, select it in the device list by clicking on it once and then clicking the <b class="calibre13">Activate </b>button. After a moment or two of probing (the progress of which will be shown  in a small window), your device will be activated and that will be indicated in the  Status column. This point-and-click approach can be used not only to activate  and deactivate wireless devices, but wired devices as well, making it convenient if you use both connection methods.<a name="832" id="832"/><a name="IDX-261" id="IDX-261"/>

</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The other way to activate your wireless card is rather simple: Pull your card out  until you hear your machine beep once, and then reinsert the card, after which your machine will beep twice, the LEDs on the NIC will start blinking, and all will  be well with the world. I like to call this the <i class="calibre11">tactile approach</i>. It is quick, effective,  and exceedingly straightforward. That said, it is only fair to point out that  hardware is hardware, and as such it can wear out or become damaged over time, so keep that in mind if you take a shine to this manner of doing things. After all,  some PCMCIA slots can seem a bit flimsy. Just use your best judgment.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While using certain wireless NICs under Linux, you may experience what seems  like a system freeze. It doesn’t happen very often, but it usually occurs while some  sort of Internet operation is going on, either in the background or foreground. I  like to call this the <i class="calibre11">Wi-Fi quirkies,</i> though you can just call it a pain in the posterior  if you like. You will know when the quirkies strike because you won’t be able to  do anything, not even move your mouse. <a name="835" id="835"/><a name="IDX-262" id="IDX-262"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fortunately, the solution to this is quick and easy — the tactile approach,  which I explained in the <a href="DDU0138.html#831" target="_parent">previous section</a>. Just pull your wireless card out of the  computer for a second and — <i class="calibre11">beep</i> — everything will go back to normal. Stick the  card back in to reactivate and use it, and — <i class="calibre11">beep beep</i> — you can go right back to  whatever it was you were doing on the Internet. It’s a simple and sure-fire way of  solving the problem (and it sure beats kicking the machine).</p>
