    has a powerful command-line interface. It allows you to perform many tasks (exporting,
    document modifications, queries, and so on) from scripts or from a console, without
    using Inkscape’s graphical user interface (GUI).

    does not load the GUI at all; after completing the task, Inkscape simply quits.

    wasted on creating and destroying the GUI.
