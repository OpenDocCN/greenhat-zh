- en: Well, this is the end of our adventure through a collection of wicked cool Ruby
    scripts. When we started, I recommended that you write down any ideas you had
    about creating your own wicked cool scripts. Now is the time to begin your own
    journey. I've enjoyed being able to share my passion for Ruby with you, and I
    hope you will continue to use the power of Ruby to solve any problems you may
    have. It's truly a wonderful language.

- en: I'd love to hear your feedback about the scripts—like which ones were your favorites
    or more graceful examples that you've written. Through shared knowledge, we all
    benefit. I know technologies constantly evolve, especially on the Web, so if you
    find any errors in this book, be sure to drop me a line. Check out the book's
    website at [http://www.nostarch.com/wcruby.htm/](http://www.nostarch.com/wcruby.htm/).
    Thanks again, and keep on programming!
