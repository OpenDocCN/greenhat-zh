<p class="docText1"><a name="is an" class="calibre8" id="is an"/>Courier-IMAP is an open source IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server that functions in conjunction with an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) such as Postfix. Courier-IMAP provides access to Maildir mailboxes, a system for email storage first introduced in Qmail.<a name="IDX-CHP-5-0091" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0091"/><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0092" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0092"/><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0093" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0093"/><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0094" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0094"/><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0095" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0095"/><a name="IDX-CHP-5-0096" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-5-0096"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="a POP" class="calibre8" id="a POP"/>Courier-IMAP also includes a POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) server that provides POP3 protocol access to Maildir mailboxes. POP3 is currently the most popular email retrieval protocol; virtually all email providers support it. A POP3 mail transaction consists of a client-initiated connection to the server, the downloading of messages, deletion of those messages from the server, and connection termination. This method of email retrieval is well suited to users who access their email from the same computer on a consistent basis, but it can be cumbersome for users who need email access from a variety of different computers (e.g., work, home, Internet café, etc.).</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="Mark Crispin" class="calibre8" id="Mark Crispin"/>IMAP was written by Mark Crispin in 1986 to provide an alternative to POP. Some advantages IMAP provides over POP are on-demand message downloading (only selected messages are downloaded to the client instead of the whole mailbox), support for multiple mailboxes (IMAP users can create and move messages between folders on the server), and portable mailbox access (IMAP users may move between different computers and have full access to their mail; POP users are restricted to the machine where their email was downloaded).</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="in " class="calibre8" id="in "/>Sam Varshavchik wrote Courier-IMAP in 1999. He did so to provide IMAP support to MTAs employing the Maildir format; none existed at the time.</p>
