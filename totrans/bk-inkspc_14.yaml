- en: Historically, one of the names of vector editors was *vector drawing*—or even
    simply *drawing*—applications. Bitmap editors, on the other hand, are sometimes
    called *paint programs*. The difference between drawing and painting, established
    in traditional media (such as paper and canvas), is thus carried on into the digital
    realm. Even though vector programs are now used—perhaps even preferentially—for
    more high-level tasks such as composition and layout, “simply drawing” is still
    the most basic application of this kind of tool.

    as bitmaps; even the best vector art has that recognizable smooth, computer-generated
    look. Often, however, this look is not a problem; it can even be an advantage.
    Also, vector editors have something that no bitmap editors can match: the ability
    to treat each stroke as a separate object that never merges or “flattens” into
    others (unless you tell it to). As it turns out, this infinite tweakability is
    sometimes more important for producing a good freehand drawing than the ability
    to imitate pastel strokes or wet-on-wet watercolor.'

    of art you want to create. If you need strict geometric or Bézier-shaped paths
    with precise placement of nodes, use the Pen tool (**[14.1 The Pen Tool](ch14s01.html
    "14.1 The Pen Tool")**). For freehand paths, smoothed to some degree, use the
    Pencil tool (**[14.2 The Pencil Tool](ch14s02.html "14.2 The Pencil Tool")**).
    Finally, for complex, naturalistic, pressure-sensitive filled strokes imitating
    various physical effects such as trembling or inertia, use the Calligraphic pen
    (**[14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool](ch14s03.html "14.3 The Calligraphic Pen Tool")**).
    We will also discuss the Paint bucket tool (**[14.4 The Paint Bucket Tool](ch14s04.html
    "14.4 The Paint Bucket Tool")**) for filling bounded areas, most often used in
    cartoons and freehand drawings.

    you want to place the nodes of your path. It can be thought of as a sibling of

    of this node (**[12.1.4 Bézier Curves](ch12s01.html#one2dot1dot4_beacutezier_curves

    is fixed—but the path is not finished; it now expects you to click or click-and-drag
    for a second node. In this mode, just moving the mouse around (without clicking)
    displays a red Bézier segment that shows you how the path would look if you create
    the next node at this point.

    always perpendicular to the direction of movement, which makes angle irrelevant

    displaced by automatic halftone screens. *Hatching*—filling space with many parallel
    straight or variously curved lines of varying width to represent gradual shading—is
    a very labor-intensive process. Inkscape’s guide tracking, along with background
    tracing (**[14.3.1.2 Tracing Background](ch14s03.html#one4dot3dot1dot2_tracing_background

    **[17.2 Blend Modes](ch17s02.html "17.2 Blend Modes")**), but this method is not
    too flexible and produces too obviously computer-generated output without the
    “human touch.” Manual drawing of hatch lines, on the other hand, is tedious and
    nearly impossible to do uniformly. However, the guide tracking capability allows
    you to hatch quickly and uniformly, at the same time giving you sufficient manual
    control over the process.

    You will see a gray *track circle* centered at your mouse pointer and touching
    the closest point on the selected guide path. (If you have no guide path selected,
    a status bar message will tell you to select it.)
  prefs: []

- en: Now move your mouse closer to the guide path, so that the track circle radius
    is equal to the desired spacing of your hatch pattern, and start drawing along
    the guide path. As soon as you start drawing, the radius of the circle locks and
    the circle turns green; now the circle slides along the guide path—and the actual
    stroke is drawn by the center of the tracking circle, *not* by your mouse point.
    As a result, you are getting a smooth stroke going parallel to the guide path,
    always at the same distance from it.

    yet, because as long as you have it pressed, the tool remembers the hatch spacing
    you set when you started drawing. Since you have just created a new stroke, that
    stroke object is selected instead of what was selected before—which means it now
    becomes the new guide path. Next, draw a second stroke along the first one, then
    a third one along the second, and so on. Eventually, you can fill any desired
    space with nice uniform hatching, as shown in [Figure 14-20](ch14s03.html#creating_uniform_hatching

    similarly to simple drag, except from each point of the drag path, the fill spreads
    to the neighbors (if any) whose colors are similar to the color of the *initial
    point* (the point where you started the drag), not the point through which you’re
    dragging. This lets you fill a series of similarly colored yet separated areas
    (for example, multiple cells in a cartoon) by starting the drag in one of those
    areas and ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg)-dragging
    through all the other areas.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When looking for color boundaries to stop at, the Paint bucket looks by default
    at the colors as they are seen on the canvas. However, you can also restrict its
    vision to a specific color channel. The **Fill by** drop-down menu, apart from
    the default **Visible Colors**, allows you to choose any of the three RGB channels
    (**Red**, **Green**, **Blue**), any of the HSL channels (**Hue**, **Saturation**,
    **Lightness**), or the **Alpha** channel (opacity).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you select the **Red** channel, even the sharpest green/blue
    color boundaries won’t stop the fill. Choosing the **Alpha** channel makes the
    tool ignore any colors and only look at where opacity changes; for example, if
    you have a complex, multicolored, but fully opaque object over a transparent background,
    clicking this object in **Alpha** mode will fill up to the outline of the entire
    object.

- en: The **Threshold** parameter, with a range from 0 to 100, controls how different
    a point’s color must be, compared to the initial click point, in order to stop
    the propagation of the fill. Zero tolerance means only the area of strictly the
    same color will be filled; the larger the tolerance, the larger the filled area
    will be, and the easier it will be for the fill to leak away into adjacent color
    areas. The default value is 10.

- en: Using the **Grow/shrink by** parameter, you can control the amount of inset
    or outset (**[12.4 Offsetting](ch12s04.html "12.4 Offsetting")**) to be applied
    to the created fill path. It works much the same as the **Outset** and **Inset**
    path commands, except it’s done automatically after every fill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A positive **Grow/shrink** value causes the fill path to be larger than the
    filled bitmap area it represents; this is often useful for eliminating anti-aliasing
    gaps between the fill and its boundary. A negative value makes the path smaller,
    ensuring a constant-width gap between the fill and the boundary.

    (**[11.1.2 The Style of New Shapes](ch11s01.html#one1dot1dot2_the_style_of_new_shapes
    "11.1.2 The Style of New Shapes")**) for the objects it creates (this is the default),
    or it can use its own fixed style. You can switch between these modes in the tool’s
    **Inkscape Preferences** (double-click the tool icon to access it). As with other
    tools, the style swatch on the far right of the controls bar shows the style that
    will be used for the next fill object you create. To change the last set color
    without affecting any object, just deselect (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735372.png.jpg))
