    recordings. As I keep saying, your best approach is to make the cleanest
    recordings you can, because that is a lot easier than fixing them. There
    is no TV crime-show magic; there are limits to what you can do.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0002" class="indexterm"/></p><p>However, there is a lot you can do to fix problems, so we’re going
    to learn how to do that in this chapter. (If you need a refresher, <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> covers the basics of using
    Audacity, and <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap">Chapter 2</a>
    goes into building a simple recording studio.</p><div class="sect1" title="Split Stereo Tracks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="split_stereo_tracks"/>Split Stereo Tracks</h1></div></div></div><p>Oftentimes only half of a stereo track will have a defect. So, you
      should split the track (<span class="strong"><strong>Split Stereo
      Track</strong></span> in the Track menu), apply repairs to each track
      independently, and then rejoin them with <span class="strong"><strong>Make
      Stereo Track</strong></span> from the Track menu. Then you’ll have the
      advantage of the good half helping to mask imperfect repairs.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0003" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>

      This is a fast way to apply the same effect with the same settings over
      and over. The Effects menu is a bit inconvenient because the effects go
      away when you click OK, so when you need the same effect over and over,
      it gets a bit tedious to wade through the whole menu again and
      again.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0006" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Noise Removal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="noise_removal-id2"/>Noise Removal</h1></div></div></div><p>There is no Hollywood magic wand like those used by the TV-crime
      lab techs who take a damaged lo-fi recording, clean it up, separate all
      the different elements, and magically isolate a voice print of the bad
      guy from way in the background ... or match the exact waveform of the
      engine noise of the getaway vehicle and identify the make and model,
      identify the rare custom shoes from the sound of footsteps, or any of
      the other fanciful things TV writers come up with. It just isn’t so.
      Trying to separate multiple sounds on a single track is like trying to
      decompile a mixed drink; once everything is mixed together, there really
      isn’t a practical way to separate it again. Noise removal is always a
      compromise with its side effects, and that is why recording studios use
      multitrack recorders in soundproofed rooms—because getting a clean
      recording is always better than trying to clean up a mucky
      one.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>However, sometimes unwanted noises sneak in, and you don’t have
      the luxury of redoing the recording. Audacity’s Noise Reduction effect
      works pretty well when the noise is distinctly different from what you
      want to keep and you have a sample of pure noise to build a noise
      profile. A common example is the stylus hiss or turntable rumble from a
      vinyl record album. These are easy to clean up: First select a section
      of just the hiss or rumble, then click <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Noise
      Removal</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Get Profile</strong></span>
      to create a profile of the noise. Make sure nothing but noise is
      selected and make it as long as possible, up to 30 seconds. Even 5- to
      10-second profiles will work, but longer ones are more accurate. When
      Audacity is finished building the profile, the Noise Removal panel will
      disappear.</p><p>The next step is to select the track segment you want to fix,
      select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Noise Removal</strong></span>, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. It is better to apply Noise Removal as
      surgically as you can because it alters your recording. The difference
      might not be obvious unless you’re listening for it, but it does make
      perceptible changes to the parts you want to keep.</p><p>If you don’t like the results, press <span class="keycap">ctrl</span>-Z to undo, change some settings, and try
      it again. The default noise reduction level is -24 dB, which means
      frequencies identified as noise are attenuated by -24 dB. If this
      removes too much of the recording, set a higher decibel value, such as
      -20 dB, and try it again. A trick that often works well to reduce bad
      side effects is to go back to your noise sample, decrease its amplitude
      a few dB, create a new profile, and try again. Chances are you won’t be
      able to erase the noise completely because doing so may erase things you
      want to keep, but you can lower it to where it’s not so
      noticeable.</p><p>The Frequency Smoothing slider is more surgical at smaller values
      and affects a wider range of frequencies as you move the slider right to
      set larger values. Try smaller values first, because they’ll affect less
      of your recording.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Attack/decay time slider determines how fast the Noise Removal
      effect responds to change in the audio signal. For noise that is fairly
      steady, use a larger value. If the noise fluctuates rapidly, then use a
      smaller value for a faster response time (<a class="xref" href="ch12s03.html#this_shows_some_gentle_noise_removal_set" title="Figure 12-1. This shows some gentle Noise Removal settings: Frequencies identified as noise are reduced by 19 dB, frequency smoothing is narrow, and attack and decay times are moderately slow.">Figure 12-1</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0013" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="this_shows_some_gentle_noise_removal_set"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e16889"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797797.png.jpg" alt="This shows some gentle Noise Removal settings: Frequencies identified as noise are reduced by 19 dB, frequency smoothing is narrow, and attack and decay times are moderately slow."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-1. This shows some gentle Noise Removal settings: Frequencies

<div class="sect1" title="Normalization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="normalization-id4"/>Normalization</h1></div></div></div><p>The Normalize effect (<span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span>
      &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Normalize</strong></span>) is the workhorse of
      many a digital recording studio, because it is common to record to a
      peak of -12 dB or lower, sometimes all the way down to -24 dB.
      Normalization is usually the last step before export to bring your
      recording up to a higher peak volume level. Digital audio has such a
      wide dynamic range that you can record to conservative peak levels to
      avoid distortion and then later normalize your tracks to bring the peak
      levels up to a comfortable playback level.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Normalization is also used to bring multiple tracks up to the same
      peak volume level. Do not use Normalize if you want to preserve the
      relative volume levels of different tracks. For example, if you have one
      track that peaks at -6 dB and another one that peaks at -12 dB and you
      want to keep the 6 dB spread, don’t use Normalize; use Amplify. With
      Amplify you can raise or lower them a set amount, for example +3 dB,
      which would raise them to -3 dB and -9 dB, respectively. But if you want
      both tracks raised to a peak of -3 dB, then Normalize is the tool for
      the job.</p><p>Always leave “Remove any DC offset” checked, because DC offset is
      not something you want to keep. If there is any DC offset, this
      indicates that your mean amplitude is not zero. A little bit of offset
      is no big deal, but if the offset is big enough, it will mess up your
      dynamic range, and it could even cause some distortion (<a class="xref" href="ch12s04.html#always_check_lremove_any_dc_offsetr_and" title="Figure 12-2. Always check “Remove any DC offset” and “Normalize maximum amplitude to” and set a maximum decibel value of zero or less.">Figure 12-2</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0020" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>DC offset</em></span> is short for <span class="emphasis"><em>DC offset

<div class="sect1" title="Remove Clicks and Scratches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="remove_clicks_and_scratches"/>Remove Clicks and Scratches</h1></div></div></div><p>Audacity offers a couple of fast ways to clean up a scratchy
      recording of a vinyl LP. Digital recordings can also pick up clicks from
      various sources. The first of these is Click Removal: It’s not as
      reliable as manually correcting scratches, but it’s fast and pretty
      good.</p><div class="sect2" title="Click Removal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="click_removal"/>Click Removal</h2></div></div></div><p>The Click Removal effect (<a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html#the_click_removal_effect_takes_only_two" title="Figure 12-4. The Click Removal effect takes only two settings.">Figure 12-4</a>) looks for spikes
        in the waveform that are typical of pops caused by scratches, deletes
        the scratch, and then does a bit of interpolation to reconstruct the
        waveform. The Select Threshold setting determines the sensitivity for
        deciding when a spike is a scratch; it uses an algorithm that compares
        the audio on both sides of the spike to figure out what part is the
        scratch and what part is the good audio. Its value is the square of
        the required ratio between the amplitudes inside and outside the loud
        section. In other words, smaller Select Threshold values are more
        sensitive, and larger values are less sensitive. Higher sensitivity
        means it may alter peaks that are not clicks, and a too-low Select
        Threshold will miss some clicks. The Max spike width determines the
        maximum length of a segment, in milliseconds, that the Click Removal
        tool will operate on.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_click_removal_effect_takes_only_two"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e16978"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797803.png.jpg" alt="The Click Removal effect takes only two settings."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-4. The Click Removal effect takes only two settings.</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="here_is_a_click_that_is_less_than_3_ms_l"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e16986"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797805.png.jpg" alt="Here is a click that is less than 3 ms long."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-5. Here is a click that is less than 3 ms long.</p></div><p>To get an idea of the Max spike width value to use, first set
        the Selection Start value on the Selection toolbar to Length, and set
        the time parameter to hh:mm:ss + milliseconds. Then zoom in on a click
        in the waveform and select it, and you’ll have its length in
        milliseconds. The Max spike width should be large enough to include
        some good audio samples on both sides of the click so that it will
        have enough good audio to compare to. <a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html#here_is_a_click_that_is_less_than_3_ms_l" title="Figure 12-5. Here is a click that is less than 3 ms long.">Figure 12-5</a> shows a spike
        that is less than 3 ms long. I usually stick with the default of 20
        ms, which gives good results most of the time.</p><p>Loud, obvious scratches are the easiest. The Click Removal
        effect doesn’t handle sections of light, crackly static very well; the
        Noise Removal effect is better for this. Click Removal is fast and
        pretty good, but it’s not 100 percent, and it may mistake percussion
        effects for scratches.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Repair"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="repair"/>Repair</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="a_brief_clipped_segment_smoothed_over_wi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17003"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797807.png.jpg" alt="A brief clipped segment smoothed over with the Repair effect"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-6. A brief clipped segment smoothed over with the Repair

        has to be applied manually, one scratch at a time, but it does a great
        job. Zoom in until you can precisely select a region no more than 128
        samples long, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Repair</strong></span>. It will delete the selection and then

        it less noticeable. The sound itself doesn’t change because you’re

      minutes, without losing any audio? Perhaps you have a recording with a
      lot of silences you would like to trim. The pauses between songs are too
      long, your deep thoughts are interspersed with long pauses, or you have
      a sound-activated recording with a lot of dead air. The Truncate Silence
      effect will automatically find and shorten those silent
      intervals.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0027" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Don’t use the Truncate Silence effect after you have created

      duration, Max silence duration, Silence compression, and Threshold for
      silence. The simplest way to use this effect is to set the min and max
      duration to the same values and adjust your threshold so that it catches
      only silent passages. In <a class="xref" href="ch12s06.html#these_settings_for_truncate_silence_look" title="Figure 12-8. These settings for Truncate Silence look for silent passages longer than 800 ms and then shorten any silence of -40 dB or quieter to 800 ms.">Figure 12-8</a>, any silent
      passages (-40 dB or quieter) greater than 800 ms long will be shortened
      to 800 ms. (1,000 ms is 1 second.)</p><p>Don’t set Max silence duration to zero because it might crash or
      do some other unpredictable behavior. The minimum I have found to be
      reliable is 5 ms, though some folks push it down to 1. If you want no
      silences at all, you’ll have to delete them manually, though to my ears
      1 ms is as good as zero.</p><p>Threshold for silence tells it what threshold to use to mark where
      the silent passages begin. A value of -35 or -40 dB works well when the
      silent passages are really silent; when they’re noisy like on an LP,
      with stylus noise between songs or turntable hum, you might have to kick
      it up to -25 dB.</p><p>The Silence compression setting configures a ratio, rather than a
      fixed length of silence duration, so that your silences will vary in
      length. You might want to use this to preserve the natural cadence of a
      speaking voice or to make a live performance sound more realistic.
      Suppose your min duration is 100 ms and your max duration is 5,000 ms.
      If you set the silence compression to 4:1, a 10-second silence will then
      be reduced to 2 seconds. The results will vary according to the
      difference between your max duration and your longest silences. To get a
      predictable result, you can use Truncate Silence to shorten the longest
      silences to whatever maximum you want and then apply it again using
      silence compression.</p></div>

      mixing multiple tracks and the tempo is off by a small bit on any of
      them. It changes tempo without changing the pitch. You can apply it to
      selections, whole tracks, or multiple tracks. There are a couple of ways
      to approach this. One is by trial and error; just fiddle with the
      Percent Change setting until it sounds right. Some folks have great ears
      and can do this quickly. You can also set the Beats per Minute (BPM). If
      your other tracks follow a known BPM, then use this. If you don’t know
      the correct BPM, play a minute of a track with the correct tempo and
      count the beats. I do this with a stopwatch, and it works great when no
      one else is around to bother me and interrupt my counting.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0029" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0030" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0031" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="change_tempo_gives_you_three_ways_to_cor"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17111"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797813.png.jpg" alt="Change Tempo gives you three ways to correct the tempo, as well as a Preview button."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-9. Change Tempo gives you three ways to correct the tempo, as well

      So, you can speed up your audio to play fast and high, like an
      over-caffeinated Alvin and the Chipmunks, or low and slow like Samuel
      Ramey, the famous bass-baritone opera singer, on tranquilizers. It
      supports the standard turntable speeds of 33 1/3, 45, and 78 RPM and a
      range of arbitrary speeds controlled by a slider or by typing in a
      percentage value (<a class="xref" href="ch12s09.html#change_speed_changes_both_pitch_and_temp" title="Figure 12-11. Change Speed changes both pitch and tempo.">Figure 12-11</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0035" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="change_speed_changes_both_pitch_and_temp"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17164"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797817.png.jpg" alt="Change Speed changes both pitch and tempo."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-11. Change Speed changes both pitch and tempo.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Compress Dynamic Range"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="compress_dynamic_range"/>Compress Dynamic Range</h1></div></div></div><p>This is a dynamic range compressor, not to be confused with file
      compression. Dynamic range compression is commonly thought of as “make
      the loud bits quieter and the quiet bits louder.” Most compressors only
      reduce gain; they narrow the dynamic range by attenuating the louder
      parts so that the range between the soft and loud parts is reduced. It
      is overused and abused in commercial recordings, which is a shame
      because it is a useful effect when it is used carefully and with good
      purpose. My preference is to use compression as little as possible,
      because I think many “fixes” done with compression are better worked out
      during recording, with the Amplify or Normalize effects, or with the
      Envelope tool.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0038" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can use compression to improve the balance of recordings by
      reducing the dynamic range of tracks that are supposed to be more in the
      background and not drawing attention to themselves. Apply some
      compression to level out changes in volume and maybe lower their overall
      volume, and they become good little supporting players. You can tailor
      recordings for different playback devices and environments. You can
      apply compression to an entire recording or to individual tracks or
      parts of tracks.</p><p>For example, if you want background music for playing in a noisy
      environment, compressing its dynamic range will make it easier to listen
      to because you’ll have a more consistent volume level, rather than
      having unexpected peaks interspersed with inaudible passages. A podcast
      with several different people speaking will benefit from careful volume
      control and compression, especially when you’re recording people who are
      not experienced with talking into microphones and who don’t speak at a
      consistent level. For this kind of recording, you’ll get best results by
      manually adjusting the amplitude until it’s as consistent as you can get
      it (the Envelope tool is great for this) and then applying some careful
      compression to the final mix for a last bit of polish. Adjusting voice
      tracks can take a fair bit of finessing, because some voices sound
      louder even when they’re not. You should also keep in mind how your
      audience is likely to listen to your recording—if they’re at work or
      listening on earbuds or listening to something designed to soothe them
      to sleep, be kind and don’t surprise them with sudden spikes in
      volume.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0042" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0043" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0044" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0045" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Compression can smooth out uneven volume levels caused by an
      inexperienced performer or one who is having a bit of an off day. For
      example, your bass guitar player is tired and hits some notes too hard
      and some not hard enough. Or your singer has bad mic technique and moves
      around too much, so she fades in and out. Maybe you have a vocalist or
      other soloist who needs to stand out from the mix, so applying a bit of
      careful compression to their track and then increasing the amplitude
      will push them to the front.</p><p>Most compressors make your selection quieter, so you may have to
      use the Amplify or Normalize effect after applying compression.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Apply dynamic range compression conservatively, because when it
        is overdone, it can create a bellows effect, with the volume rising
        and lowering on a regular beat. Another side effect is raising your
        noise floor, because noise becomes relatively louder along with the
        quieter passages. Yet one more side effect is giving greater emphasis
        to background sounds, such as audience noise. Too much compression can
        introduce distortion.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="How Much Dynamic Range?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="how_much_dynamic_range_question"/>How Much Dynamic Range?</h2></div></div></div><p>So, what is a good dynamic range to aim for when you’re applying
        dynamic range compression to a recording? The definitive answer is “It
        depends.” First let’s talk about what is possible and what we hear,
        and then we’ll look at some examples for various situations.</p><p>Human hearing can perceive a range of roughly 120 dB. The
        maximum real-life dynamic range in digital audio is about 115 dB. The
        dynamic range of a CD is about 96 dB. Vinyl LPs can deliver as much as
        60 dB. A live symphony might encompass 80 dB. A comfortable listening
        range for most folks is going to be narrower than that, more like 20
        to 30 dB, which is still a nice wide range. What works for you might
        take some trial and error. My own rule of thumb is under ideal
        listening conditions, at home using my good stereo hi-fi, without
        distractions or people talking to me, I’m comfortable with a dynamic
        range of no more than 50 dB. And that’s when I’m in the mood for a
        dramatic opera or symphony or a raucous live rock show. Most of the
        time I prefer something a little quieter.</p><p>Sometimes you hear new things in familiar recordings when you
        narrow the dynamic range, because this “raises” the quiet parts. (It’s
        all relative; reducing the gain on the louder frequencies makes the
        quieter ones sound louder.) You might hear feet hitting piano or drum
        pedals, performers muttering asides, more nuances in quiet parts—you
        just don’t know until you try.</p><p>You can easily experiment in Audacity to get a feel for
        different dynamic ranges by recording a simple test file and then
        using <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span> to set different parts of it at
        different dB levels. <a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html#a_simple_dynamic_range_test_colon_starti" title="Figure 12-12. A simple dynamic range test: Starting at -50 dB, each 10-second segment is 10 dB louder.">Figure 12-12</a> shows a simple
        recording where, starting at -50 dB, each 10-second segment is 10 dB
        louder until it reaches the maximum of 0.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_simple_dynamic_range_test_colon_starti"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17249"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797819.png.jpg" alt="A simple dynamic range test: Starting at -50 dB, each 10-second segment is 10 dB louder."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-12. A simple dynamic range test: Starting at -50 dB, each
          10-second segment is 10 dB louder.</p></div><p>Modern popular music is typically mashed into a 5 dB or even
        smaller range, at peak amplitude or over, which is a horrible thing to
        do to good music. In many modern recordings and remastered old
        recordings, the dynamic range is so narrow that it’s like pushing
        everything to the redline. There are no quiet passages, no nuance, and
        no contrast; it’s just one loud schmear. It destroys nuance and
        flavor. The reasons for doing this are a splendid combination of
        simplicity and stupidity—when we hear two recordings at different
        volume levels, our initial impression favors the louder one as
        sounding better. It’s also used to make a track stand out from the
        pack when it’s played on radio or TV or in a public place. But that
        hardly works anymore since they all do it.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0046" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The end result is compressing the life out of a recording. It’s
        aural junk food—sure, that first hit of a candy bar or potato chip, or
        whatever your particular favorite goody is, is mighty nice. But you
        can’t live on junk food, and it soon becomes unsatisfying. It’s the
        same way with overdone compression; that first impression might be
        “the louder one is better!” But after a few minutes of listening, most
        folks change their minds and prefer a better-engineered recording.
        Even if you’re not consciously aware that a recording has been
        butchered beyond hope with compression, you’ll likely experience
        fatigue and get tired of listening. A web search on <span class="emphasis"><em>loudness
        wars</em></span> will return a lot of interesting information.</p><p>You can see this as well as hear it by ripping a song from a
        music CD, importing it into Audacity, and viewing the waveform. <a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html#quotation_mark_the_magazine_comma_quotat" title="Figure 12-13. &quot;The Magazine,&quot; by Rickie Lee Jones, was engineered with some actual dynamic range.

        selection from Rickie Lee Jones’s “The Magazine”; compare this to any
        Top 40 contemporary CD. “The Magazine” is a wonderful work that
        rewards attentive listening on a good sound system, and you can see in
        the waveform that it has not been compressed into a useless tiny
        dynamic range, nor have all the levels been maxed out. In fact, it
        doesn’t come anywhere near the red line. I prefer recordings made with
        the assumption that I know what to do with a volume knob.</p><div class="figure"><a id="quotation_mark_the_magazine_comma_quotat"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17271"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797821.png.jpg" alt="&quot;The Magazine,&quot; by Rickie Lee Jones, was engineered with some actual dynamic range.

        point fingers, but you can find plenty with a quick web search and
        probably in your own music collection. It’s that same old race to the
        bottom, the familiar battle of quality and artistry against pandering
        to the lowest common denominator. In this modern era, that is lo-fi
        MP3s played on tiny, lo-fi portable devices and computer speakers, and
        loud systems with horrid powered subwoofers that are to music what hot
        sauce is to food—a little bit adds punctuation and contrast; a big
        whacking overdose kills off all the flavor and enjoyment and turns it
        into an act of aggression.</p><p>One more horrid example of dynamic range compression abuse is
        television commercials. They are supposedly not allowed to be louder
        than the programming, but they get around this by having no dynamic
        range at all but with everything pushed to the maximum. (I think they
        are louder, too.)<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0047" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0048" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0052" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Compressor Settings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="compressor_settings"/>Compressor Settings</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="audacityas_compressor_effect_is_simple_c"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17309"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797823.png.jpg" alt="Audacity’s Compressor effect is simple, with just a few settings."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-14. Audacity’s Compressor effect is simple, with just a few
          settings.</p></div><p>That’s enough complaining about the state of the world. Let’s
        fire up <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Compressor</strong></span> and learn what the different
        settings do (<a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html#audacityas_compressor_effect_is_simple_c" title="Figure 12-14. Audacity’s Compressor effect is simple, with just a few settings.">Figure 12-14</a>). Most times,
        using compression is two steps: Apply the Compressor, and then raise
        the volume level of the compressed segment back up to where you want
        it.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0053" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This is a simple compressor with only four settings. The pros
        use expensive hardware compressors, and Audacity’s Compressor does not
        quite match these in ability. But it’s good enough for performing
        basic compression chores.</p><p>The Threshold setting determines the starting point, in
        decibels, where the audio signal is attenuated. A threshold of -50 dB
        means all parts of the signal with an amplitude of -50 dB and above
        will be attenuated. This on most recordings will be everything.
        Usually you don’t want to compress everything; you get better results
        with a light touch and tailoring it for a specific purpose.</p><p>The Noise Floor setting holds the gain at a constant level on
        audio below the Noise Floor setting. If your track has a lot of quiet
        sections, this keeps them from being amplified.</p><p>The Ratio setting determines how much compression will be
        applied. A 4:1 ratio means an input signal of 4 dB higher than your
        threshold will be reduced to 1 dB higher than the threshold. A ratio
        of infinity brings everything down to the threshold level. In
        Audacity’s Compressor effect, the maximum is 10:1. Other compressors
        go up to 60:1, which in practice is the same as infinite. The graph in
        the Compressor gives you a nice visual of this, showing that low
        ratios are more gentle and higher ratios result in greater gain
        reduction.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0054" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Again, my approach is “Less is better.” It’s easy to experiment
        with this in Audacity and listen to how your audio quality is affected
        by different settings. I use compression sparingly, rarely going over
        a -20 dB threshold or a 4:1 ratio. If I’m thinking a recording needs
        more than that, I stop and think about what it really needs—some
        careful adjustments with the Envelope tool? Rerecording?</p><p>Attack Time determines how quickly the compressor reaches its
        maximum effect, and Decay Time determines how long it takes to phase
        out the compression. A too-short Attack Time setting could result in
        some audible distortion, and a too-long Decay Time might miss some
        short peaks. You can get some different effects with different attack
        times. For example, a longer Attack Time setting such as 0.5 seconds
        will not catch and attenuate a sharp drumbeat, so this adds some
        punch. A fast Attack Time dampens percussion and other sharp peaks.
        You probably want the fastest Attack Time for vocalists, which is 0.1
        seconds, unless you’re trying for some unusual effects.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0056" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A slower Decay Time can create a long, almost soaring fade-out.
        This is a common technique used to extend a guitar note. Audacity’s
        Compressor is medium good at this, and it goes up to 10 seconds. If
        you’re going for a natural sound, a fast Decay Time is better. Play
        around with it to see what it does to different instruments and
        vocals. For example, a drum track with a fast Attack Time setting and
        a slow Decay Time setting will sound interesting, almost backward or
        echoey, because the beats are not allowed to decay naturally but are
        held longer at a louder level.</p><p>A common side effect of compression is <span class="emphasis"><em>pumping and
        breathing</em></span>. This happens when you select a high Threshold
        setting and there is a lot of variation in the track. The fluctuation
        of the compressor causes the attack/decay to become audible. Sometimes
        this is fun to do on purpose.</p><p>Sometimes some odd-sounding artifacts will be appended by the
        Compressor to the end of your recording. This is a normal by-product
        of compression, so deal with it by padding the end of your recording
        with something you can delete after applying compression.</p><p>“Make-up gain for 0dB after compressing” saves a step if you
        were going to normalize to zero anyway.</p><p>There is a checkbox for “Compress based on Peaks.” When this box
        is unchecked, which is the default, the compressor reduces the gain on
        sounds above the threshold level. “Compress based on Peaks” raises the
        gain on quieter sounds that are above the threshold level. I don’t
        think that it sounds very good; to me, it’s harsh, and the pumping
        effect is hard to avoid. But then it’s your ears that have to be
        pleased, not mine.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Chris's Dynamic Compressor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="chris_apostrophy_s_dynamic_compre"/>Chris's Dynamic Compressor</h2></div></div></div><p>There is another compressor, Chris’s dynamic compressor (<a class="ulink" href="http://pdf23ds.net/software/dynamic-compressor/">http://pdf23ds.net/software/dynamic-compressor/</a>), that
        is tailor-made for compressing classical music in a pleasing way. I

        Audacity Compressor effect.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0057" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0060" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The author, Chris Capel, was inspired to write this compressor
        because he often listened to classical music in noisy environments.
        After spending a lot of time fiddling with the volume controls, which
        wasn’t very rewarding, he decided that applying some dynamic range
        compression to his recordings was the solution. But the compressors he
        tried didn’t sound good enough, so he wrote his own Nyquist compressor
        plug-in for Audacity. Since it is a Nyquist plug-in, it will work on
        Linux, Mac, and Windows; just download and copy it to your plug-ins
        directory. It will appear in the Effect menu as “Compress dynamics.”
        It has good instructions right on the plug-in itself, as <a class="xref" href="ch12s10.html#the_default_simple_view_of_chrisas_compr" title="Figure 12-15. The default simple view of Chris’s compressor">Figure 12-15</a> shows.</p><p>Mr. Capel is continually changing and improving his plug-in, so

        adjusts the gain in anticipation of what is coming next. Most
        compressors do not do this but rather react to changes in volume, so
        there is always a bit of lag. Sometimes this results in a loud peak
        abruptly reduced or, worse, some distortion. Chris’s compressor
        operates more smoothly and handles percussion and other loud transient
        events gracefully. It is worth reading the comments on his web page,
        and he includes some audio samples. The source file,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>compress.ny</em></span>, is a plaintext file and contains
        useful information.</p><p>Chris’s compressor is a nice piece of work, so let’s review its
        options.</p><p>Compress ratio operates differently from compression ratio
        settings on most other compressors. It works two ways:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic compression</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic
        expansion</em></span>. Values range from -0.50 to +1.25. Negative
        values make the quiet frequencies quieter, which is called
        <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic expansion</em></span>. Positive values reduce the
        gain on the louder frequencies, which is called <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic
        compression</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0063" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The default of 0.5 is pretty nice. It preserves a lot of the
        original dynamic range and sounds natural. According to some posts in
        the Audacity forums, 0.77 matches the NPR radio station KPCC Pasadena.
        So if you want to be like KPCC Pasadena, now you know how.</p><p>Release speed is like the Decay Time setting in the Audacity
        compressor, controlling how quickly the compression is phased out.
        Values are in milliseconds, so fewer milliseconds equal a faster
        release speed.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0064" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Attack speed is similar to the Attack Time setting in the
        Audacity compressor, controlling how quickly the compression is
        applied, until it reaches its peak ratio. If your recording has a lot
        of rapid peaks, you probably want a faster attack speed to catch them.
        However, you can add some punch to drumbeats, for one example, with a
        slower attack time so that they are not compressed as much. Generally,
        music has faster increases in volume than decreases, so to keep pace
        with the music, attack times should be faster, and release times
        should be slower.</p><p>The effects of the release and attack speeds are more subtle
        than their counterparts in the Audacity compressor and less prone to
        introducing typical compression artifacts.</p><p>Compression hardness controls how quickly compression is applied
        and released. A higher hardness value equals slower attack and release
        speeds, and a lower value is a faster, more aggressive attack and
        release. This appears only in the simplified view and is like a
        shortcut for setting the release and attack speeds, except you can’t
        adjust them individually.</p><p>Floor sets a floor, or <span class="emphasis"><em>noise gate</em></span>; the
        default is -32 dB, which means nothing below -32 dB is changed. Use
        this setting to define a range of the quieter frequencies that won’t
        be changed. You might want to do this if you have a some low-level
        background noise you don’t want amplified or you just don’t want the
        quieter frequencies altered.</p><p>Noise gate falloff takes values from -2 to 10. Positive values
        reduce the gain on everything below your Floor setting, and higher
        values reduce the gain to a greater degree. Negative values do the
        opposite and boost frequencies that are below your Floor setting. I
        usually leave this at zero so it does nothing, though occasionally I
        will use it to boost the lower frequencies a little bit.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0066" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Maximum amplitude raises the amplitude after compressing, so you
        can save a normalization step. It is not a decibel scale, so it may
        take a bit of trial and error to get it right. (I think it’s easier to
        just apply normalization.)</p><p>Attack and Release Exponents take values from 1 to 6, with 1
        meaning do nothing and 6 meaning do the most. What do these do to your
        recording? They work in concert with your Attack speed and Release
        speed settings to control the responsiveness of the compressor. Mr.
        Capel advises that the default values of 2.00 and 4.00 should give
        pleasing results most of the time.</p><p>Chris’s Compressor doesn’t remember your last settings after you
        close Audacity but instead reverts to the defaults in
        <span class="emphasis"><em>compress.ny</em></span>. If you figure out some different
        settings that you like better, you can make those the defaults by
        editing <span class="emphasis"><em>compress.ny</em></span>. Here are some settings as
        they appear in the file:</p><a id="I_programlisting12_d1e17487"/><pre class="programlisting">;control compress-ratio "Compress ratio" real "" .5 -.5 1.25
;control floor "Floor" real "dB" -32 -96 0</pre><p>The first numbers are the defaults, and the second set of
        numbers are the minimum and maximum values. So if you prefer 0.6 as
        the default for the Compress ratio and -25 for the Floor setting,
        change them like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting12_d1e17491"/><pre class="programlisting">;control compress-ratio "Compress ratio" real "" .6 -.5 1.25

Careful manual
        adjustment of amplitude, compression, and normalization gives better
        results than using the Leveller effect. Leveller is simple and fast,
        but it also introduces noticeable distortion as you apply higher
        degrees of leveling. Why use it? It’s fast and easy. It sounds decent
        on spoken-word recordings and works best on ringtones. For ringtones,
        try a Moderate degree of leveling and a Threshold for Noise setting of
        -40 dB. This will flatten the whole waveform nicely, so it will sound
        richer and fuller on tiny phone speakers.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0068" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Equalization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="equalization"/>Equalization</h1></div></div></div><p>An equalizer gives you control over amplitude according to the
      frequency. Instead of the usual bass-midrange-treble controls we’re all
      used to, the Equalization effect is like having nearly infinite tone
      controls.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0069" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0070" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The modern trend in tone controls on less-expensive playback
        devices is to do away with bass-midrange-treble knobs and replace them
        with presets like Rock, Classical, Jazz, and Live. I hate these. I
        want knobs to twiddle, by dang, not cheapo microchips with a limited
        set of somebody else’s notions of what sounds good.</p></div><p>The Equalization effect has useful prefab options and many custom
      tweak options. It has preset equalization correction curves for old
      vinyl and acetate records, such as RCA 1938 and 1947, Columbia LP and
      78, Decca, and several others. Recordings made before 1955 didn’t follow
      any industry standards; only then did the RIAA equalization curve become
      widely used and eventually the industry standard.</p><p>Equalization curves were invented to overcome the physical
      limitations of vinyl and acetate recordings, because the lower
      frequencies occupy more physical space on the records. Without applying
      an equalization curve, the recordings would be very short, and the
      record would be mostly bass grooves with barely perceptible treble. To
      compensate, the lower frequencies are attenuated, and the higher
      frequencies are amplified so much that the uncorrected signal sounds
      tinny, with hardly any midrange or bass.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When you play a record, you can hear the uncorrected signal by
        putting your ear close to the stylus.</p></div><p>Your phono gear compensates for this by applying equalization
      correction, which is exactly the reverse of the original equalization
      curve: Lower frequencies are amplified, and higher frequences are
      attenuated. This is why turntables require a special phono preamp.
      Adopting the RIAA curve industrywide meant that all phono gear could
      then apply the same equalization correction.</p><p>For contemporary LPs and 45s, all you need is a standard phono
      preamp. This is the phono plug-in on your hi-fi amplifier or computer
      recording interface. For older records or for custom tweaks on modern
      vinyl, you can use a standard nonphono preamp to get the uncorrected
      signal and then apply the appropriate equalization curve using the
      Equalization effect. Or customize it to suit your own tastes. Once you
      have a custom curve tweaked to your satisfaction, use the Save As button
      to preserve it.</p><p>Try some of the equalization presets to get different effects. For
      example, some folks love that old AM radio sound, and now you have an
      easy way to replicate it with the <span class="emphasis"><em>amradio</em></span> curve.

      view, changes the scale from the default logarithmic view to linear. Use
      the logarithmic view when you want to see the lower frequencies in more
      detail and the linear view when you want to see all frequencies
      represented equally. The logarithmic view is closer to how we actually
      perceive sounds.</p><p>There are two colored lines in the graph: a thick blue line and a
      thin green line. The blue line is the one that you manipulate, and the
      green line shows the actual equalization curve. If they diverge, that is
      because you are trying to make your curve too steep. Either adjust your
      curve or try a larger length of filter. This controls the number of
      samples that Audacity operates on at a time. The default value of 4,001
      should work fine most of the time. A smaller value produces a smoother
      curve and might sound better, though you’ll need good ears and good gear
      to hear the difference.</p><p>You can go over 0 well into the +dB range, and this is okay
      because it’s not the same scale as in the track waveforms. It shows how
      many decibels of gain you’re applying (or attenuation). The RIAA curve
      applies nearly 19 dB of gain to the 20 to 40 Hz range, for example, with
      no ill effects. But you must still be careful to not create distortion
      by going too high, and only trial and error will show you where this is

      automatically time-shifts overdubbed tracks to compensate for latency.
      The default latency correction value is -130 ms, which probably is not

      is trial and error. A more precise method is to use a loopback cable.
      You need a cable to connect your playback output to your recording
      input. On an internal sound card, this is easy—line out to record in.
      For other recording interfaces, such as USB or FireWire, you’ll have to
      find the correct type of cable and sort out your outputs and
      inputs.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0079" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Then set Latency Correction to 0. Make sure that the “Snap To”

      different frequencies. It has all kinds of different algorithms and
      functions to choose from. I ignore most of these and use a Hanning
      window, Spectrum algorithm, and 512 or 1024 Size. A smaller Size value
      shows more details. The option that is meaningful to me is Axis. Axis
      offers the standard choices of Logarithmic or Linear view. When I use
      Plot Spectrum, I’m looking for obvious indicators, not molecule-sized
      differences.</p><p>One handy use of Plot Spectrum is to measure your ambient noise.
      You can get an idea of your ambient noise level with the Input Level
      Meter in the main Audacity window, but Plot Spectrum gives you a lot
      more information. Set up your mics as usual, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Transport</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Timer

      are the loudest. Since the lowest frequencies are the loudest, I can
      switch to Logarithmic view to get a more detailed look at the lower
      frequencies (<a class="xref" href="ch12s13.html#logarithmic_view_shows_the_lower_frequen" title="Figure 12-25. Logarithmic view shows the lower frequencies in more detail.">Figure 12-25</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="logarithmic_view_shows_the_lower_frequen"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17799"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797845.png.jpg" alt="Logarithmic view shows the lower frequencies in more detail."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-25. Logarithmic view shows the lower frequencies in more

      recording, and now I know to look for the source of low-frequency
      noises. That turned out to be the subwoofer of the living room hi-fi. A
      pretty good level to aim for is -50 dB, and -60 dB guarantees that no
      background noises will be audible on your recordings.</p><p>Another good use for Plot Spectrum is to get a more precise idea
      of the dynamic range of a recording that you are going to apply
      compression to. Take readings of several of your highest peaks and
      lowest lows, and then you’ll have some actual numbers to help you figure
      out what threshold to use. A good starting point is to split the
      difference: If your highest peak is -5 dB and your lowest is -35 dB, try
      a Threshold setting of -20 dB. Your own ears will tell you what works;
      this just gives you a reasonable place to start.</p><p>It can be helpful to generate sine waves at different frequencies

      frequencies ranging from 6,000 Hz to 10,000 Hz. The frequency range
      narrows as amplitude increases, from 7,500 to 8,500 at -48 dB to 7,800

      single track and want to find the song breaks and create labels at the
      breaks automatically. Then you can select <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span> to break up the track into individual
      songs. If you want to use the song names for labels, you will still have
      to type them yourself. It doesn’t work very well if the silences are not
      clean and well defined. For example, Silence Finder would be a handy
      time-saver when you are converting vinyl LPs to CDs, but vinyl records
      often have enough noise in the song breaks to confuse it.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-0083" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0084" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-0085" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can use Plot Spectrum to get an idea of the volume level in
      the song breaks and then set the Treat audio below this level as silence
      value with less trial and error. There is a funny little gotcha with
      this: Don’t enter a minus sign, because that seems to be applied
      automatically (<a class="xref" href="ch12s13.html#some_example_settings_for_the_silence_fi" title="Figure 12-27. Some example settings for the Silence Finder">Figure 12-27</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="some_example_settings_for_the_silence_fi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17849"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages797849.png.jpg" alt="Some example settings for the Silence Finder"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-27. Some example settings for the Silence Finder</p></div></div></body></html>
