This can include pretty much anyone who has anything to do with the software: The people who use it, the people who design it, the people who help others with problems . . . every last one of them is a valued community member.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0006"/></p><p>Consider the commercial software world, where things tend to be quite top-down. When you have a problem, you go to some company that provides you with support. This company probably also designed and sold you the software, and you probably played no part in that process—you’re the customer; it’s the vendor. Open source is different: Rather than one business managing everything, everyone pitches in together and helps each other. People write software and fix faults because doing so helps other people and because they want to help. Everyone can play a part in offering feedback and suggestions and helping others with problems, and no one is in absolute control of the whole process. All in all, it’s much more democratic and, in my opinion, much more fun!</p><p>The Ubuntu community in particular is large, vibrant, and notoriously friendly. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to get the most out of it and how you can play your part by joining in and giving something back (if you like).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0017"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Take Me to Your SABDFL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="take_me_to_your_sabdfl"/>Take Me to Your SABDFL</h1></div></div></div><p>Open source communities tend to have a well-defined structure, and Ubuntu is no exception. At the top of the pile is Ubuntu’s founder, Mark Shuttleworth, whom you met in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Becoming a Penguinista">Chapter 1</a>. He’s the Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life (SABDFL), and according to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/governance/">http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/governance/</a>, his role is to “provide clear leadership on difficult issues and set the pace for the project.” This doesn’t mean that he makes all of the plans and decisions—that’s more the job of the Technical Board, a group of senior Ubuntu contributors who figure out what shape the next Ubuntu release will take. Mark is just there to step in if no one can agree.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0021"/></p><p>There’s also the Community Council, which oversees the teams of contributors who make up the bulk of the project. There are lots of teams with all sorts of responsibilities: The Documentation Team writes the documentation for each release of Ubuntu, the Installer Team looks after the software used for installing Ubuntu, and so on. You can find a list of them at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams/</a>. Teams consist of members from all over the world (<a class="xref" href="ch21.html#a_world_map_showing_the_locations_of_the" title="Figure 21-1. A world map showing the locations of the members of the Ubuntu Documentation Team">Figure 21-1</a>), and people on the team may have all sorts of responsibilities. Developers, for example, are the people who write and update the software. Last, but certainly not least, are the millions of Ubuntu users worldwide who form the biggest part of the community.

Renowned computer scientist Grace Hopper, on retrieving a moth from a relay in one such giant, taped the offending insect into her logbook and remarked that she had found a “bug” in the computer. Well, computers may have changed a lot since the 1940s, but some of the terminology hasn’t. Whether it’s as major as a program crashing or freezing or as minor as a missing icon, any problem that you find with a piece of software is still referred to as a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span>.</p><p>You’ve almost certainly come across a bug before—no software, whether commercial or open source, is ever perfect. The difference with open source is that you’re strongly encouraged to report problems wherever you see them. Developers need feedback in the form of bug reports so they know what needs fixing, and problems get fixed more quickly if they’re reported sooner. Filing a bug report is a relatively easy way of giving something back to the community; it doesn’t take long, it helps to improve the software for everyone, and you get an annoying software problem fixed for free!</p><div class="sect2" title="What Counts as a Bug?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="what_counts_as_a_bug_question"/>What Counts as a Bug?</h2></div></div></div><p>There are lots of different types of bugs, but you can usually fit them into one of the following categories:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0042"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>When a program crashes, freezes, or shows an error message for no good reason (as, for example, in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#if_a_program_crashes_open_parenthesis_li" title="Figure 21-3. If a program crashes (like Chromium here), it’s probably got a bug.">Figure 21-3</a>)<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0043"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="if_a_program_crashes_open_parenthesis_li"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject21_d1e21298"/><img alt="If a program crashes (like Chromium here), it’s probably got a bug." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264042.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-3. If a program crashes (like Chromium here), it’s probably got a bug.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>When something doesn’t work (for example, when a button does nothing when you click it)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When hardware (such as a printer or your sound card) misbehaves or doesn’t work at all<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0044"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0045"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0046"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0047"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0048"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Typos, missing icons, and other cosmetic mistakes</p></li></ul></div><p>If your problem fits any of these descriptions, then you likely have a bug on your hands! You should be aware of a few notable exceptions, though. First, if a program is missing a feature, that’s not really a bug. You can still report it as a bug, but it probably won’t get much attention; try discussing it on the Ubuntu Forums first. Second, you shouldn’t ask for help with software by reporting a bug, since you probably won’t get a response. Use the forums, Ask Ubuntu website, or IRC instead; find out more on those in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#the_ubuntu_forums" title="The Ubuntu Forums">The Ubuntu Forums</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#the_ubuntu_forums" title="The Ubuntu Forums">The Ubuntu Forums</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#ask_ubuntu" title="Ask Ubuntu">Ask Ubuntu</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#whatas_all_this_bean_business_question" title="What’s All This Bean Business?">What’s All This Bean Business?</a>. Finally, it’s important that the bug be <span class="emphasis"><em>reproducible</em></span>. This means that you can provide a set of instructions for someone else to follow, and they will experience the same problem as you.

The sheer volume of bugs isn’t easy to cope with, and dealing with them has been likened to “drinking from a fire hose.” To calm the chaos, an army of volunteers called the Bug Squad pore over all the new bugs, categorizing them, identifying ones that have already been reported, asking for details on how the bugs happen, and generally trying to get enough information together for a developer to be able to swoop in and fix the issue. In practical terms, this means it can take quite a while for a problem to be fixed, although the actual timescale will depend on how important the bug is judged to be. I normally reckon on waiting two to three months for an “average” bug. Having said that, my Rhythmbox bug hasn’t been fixed yet—five years later!

The most important, interesting questions, as determined by the community, bubble up to the top of the list, get the most attention, and are thus more likely to get answered. You may have seen a similar sort of system in place on news websites and sites like YouTube; insightful comments receive lots of votes and appear at the top of the list, whereas less useful comments are buried further down the page.</p><p>Click any of the questions at the top of the Top Questions list, and you’ll find, in addition to the original text of the question, a number of comments discussing possible solutions. Some of these are marked as “answers,” which directly propose a solution to the question. Other users can vote answers up or down, so the best answer will (in principle) also bubble to the top. All in all, Ask Ubuntu is an efficient way of getting the information you need if you have a specific problem or question. If you’re not sure exactly what you’re looking for, however, the Ubuntu Forums are probably a better bet.</p><p>If you want to give Ask Ubuntu a go, the first thing to do is <span class="strong"><strong>log in</strong></span>.

Why shouldn’t it? Ubuntu is a very international venture, and communicating online is the most practical way of getting things done. Regardless, there are plenty of opportunities to contact and meet other Ubuntu users in your area through Local Community (LoCo) teams and Linux User Groups (LUGs). These groups often have a membership with diverse computing skills, so they can be a good place to go to get help with Linux, among other things.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0128"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0129"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>LoCos</em></span> tend to cover reasonably large geographic areas, normally on the scale of whole countries or states.

I stumbled into contributing to Ubuntu in early 2006, when I started tidying up some bug reports that were missing information. It was something to pass the time and took up about half an hour per day. This was back when Launchpad was new and all the bugs were being transferred from the old system, so the work was pretty fun. The members of the Bug Squad were incredibly encouraging, and I soon found myself spending more and more time doing Ubuntu stuff. As time went on, I started editing help pages on the wiki (<a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/</a>) and eventually found my way to the Documentation Team, where I coauthored a guide on switching from Windows to Ubuntu. Nowadays I’m one of the maintainers of the “upstream” help files at the GNOME project, among other things. Being a contributor has been a great experience—I’ve met tons of interesting new people, indulged my interests in writing and computers, traveled to conferences around the world, and, most importantly, had tons of fun in the process.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0137"/></p><p>Browse to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/">http://www.ubuntu.com/community/</a> to get some ideas on how you might be able to help. You don’t need to be a geek to get involved: Artists, writers, multilinguists, marketers . . . the list of ways to participate just goes on. You might even like to attend a conference and have as much fun as the contributors in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#just_a_few_of_ubuntuas_many_contributors" title="Figure 21-14. Just a few of Ubuntu’s many contributors at a conference (image created by Kenneth Wimer; used under Creative Commons license; original can be found at )">Figure 21-14</a>! To get started, all you need to do is join the relevant team and introduce yourself on its mailing list.

Intended to help you find a way to get involved with Ubuntu, it works a bit like a game. You start out by completing one or two relatively simple community-oriented tasks, like getting a Launchpad account (as you already learned how to do in “Launchpad: Your Passport to the Ubuntu Community”). For each task you complete, you’re awarded a trophy (a digital one, mind; don’t expect any engraved plaques through the mail), so you can flaunt your achievements. As you earn more trophies, other “levels” are unlocked, giving you access to more tasks that can earn you even more trophies. Each task comes with instructions on how to complete it, so you learn how things work as you go. In the process, you explore the Ubuntu community, contribute to it a little, and have some fun at the same time. And even if you ultimately decide that contributing to Ubuntu isn’t your cup of tea, you’ll at least be left with a trophy or two for your troubles.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0144"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0145"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-21-0146"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="just_a_few_of_ubuntuas_many_contributors"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject21_d1e22622"/><img alt="Just a few of Ubuntu’s many contributors at a conference (image created by Kenneth Wimer; used under Creative Commons license; original can be found at )" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264064.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-14. Just a few of Ubuntu’s many contributors at a conference (image created by Kenneth Wimer; used under Creative Commons license; original can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uds_karmic.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uds_karmic.jpg</a>)</p></div><p>You can find more information about Ubuntu Accomplishments, including installation instructions, at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accomplishments/">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accomplishments/</a>.
