- en: '**I**N THEIR WORK, Cardano, Galileo, and Pascal assumed that the probabilities
    relevant to the problems they tackled were known. Galileo, for example, assumed
    that a die has an equal chance of landing on any of its six faces. But how solid
    is such “knowledge”? The grand duke’s dice were probably designed not to favor
    any face, but that doesn’t mean fairness was actually achieved. Galileo could
    have tested his assumption by observing a number of tosses and recording how often
    each face came up. If he had repeated the test several times, however, he would
    probably have found a slightly different distribution each time, and even small
    deviations might have mattered, given the tiny differential he was asked to explain.
    In order to make the early work on randomness applicable to the real world, that
    issue had to be addressed: What is the connection between underlying probabilities
    and observed results? What does it mean, from a practical point of view, when
    we say the chances are 1 in 6 a die will land on 2? If it doesn’t mean that in
    any series of tosses the die will land on the 2 exactly 1 time in 6, then on what
    do we base our belief that the chances of throwing a 2 really are 1 in 6? And
    what does it mean when a doctor says that a drug is 70 percent effective or has
    serious side effects in 1 percent of the cases or when a poll finds that a candidate
    has support of 36 percent of voters? These are deep questions, related to the
    very meaning of the concept of randomness, a concept mathematicians still like
    to debate.'

  zh: 在他们的工作中，卡尔达诺、伽利略和帕斯卡假设他们所面对的问题相关的概率是已知的。例如，伽利略假设骰子落在任何一面上的机会是相等的。但这种“知识”有多可靠？大公的骰子可能被设计成不偏袒任何一面，但这并不意味着公平性实际上得到了实现。伽利略可以通过观察多次投掷并记录每个面出现的频率来测试他的假设。然而，如果他重复进行多次测试，他可能会发现每次测试的结果都有所不同，而且即使是很小的偏差也可能很重要，考虑到他需要解释的微小差异。为了使早期关于随机性的工作适用于现实世界，这个问题必须得到解决：潜在概率和观察结果之间有什么联系？当我们说骰子落在2上的概率是1/6时，从实际的角度来看这意味着什么？如果这不是说在任何一系列投掷中骰子恰好落在2上的次数是6次中的1次，那么我们基于什么相信投掷2的概率确实是1/6？当医生说一种药物有70%的有效性或1%的病例有严重副作用，或者当民意调查显示候选人得到了36%的选民支持时，这意味着什么？这些问题很深刻，与随机性概念的含义密切相关，这是一个数学家们仍然喜欢争论的概念。

    astronomer Simon Newcomb. Around 1881, Newcomb noticed that the pages of books
    of logarithms that dealt with numbers beginning with the numeral 1 were dirtier
    and more frayed than the pages corresponding to numbers beginning with the numeral
    2, and so on, down to the numeral 9, whose pages, in comparison, looked clean
    and new. Assuming that in the long run, wear was proportional to amount of use,
    Newcomb concluded from his observations that the scientists with whom he shared
    the book were working with data that reflected that distribution of digits. The
    law’s current name arose after Frank Benford noticed the same thing, in 1938,
    when scrutinizing the log tables at the General Electric Research Laboratory in
    Schenectady, New York. But neither man proved the law. That didn’t happen until
    1995, in work by Ted Hill, a mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

    digit 9, which should appear as the first digit about 5 percent of the time. A
    similar law, though less pronounced, applies to later digits. Many types of data

    wheels is pretty good evidence that legitimate psychics don’t exist, for in Monte

    my chances of winning, 1 out of 37\. That means that for every $1 I bet, the casino

    the laggards to catch up. Instead, some numbers are bound to come up more often
    than average and others less often. And so even after six days of observations,
    there remained a chance that Jagger was wrong. The higher frequencies he observed
    for certain numbers may have arisen by chance and may not have reflected higher
    probabilities. That means that Jagger, too, had to face the question we raised
    at the start of this chapter: given a set of underlying probabilities, how closely
    can you expect your observations of a system to conform to those probabilities?

    it remained an object of intense scrutiny, its path recorded in great detail.
    In 1687, Isaac Newton would use these data as an example of his inverse square
    law of gravity at work. And on one clear night in that parcel of land called Basel,
    Switzerland, another man destined for greatness was also paying attention. He

    Huygens presented severe limitations. It might be sufficient for games of chance,

    definite probability to the credibility of legal testimony? Or to who was the
    better golfer, Charles I of England or Mary, Queen of Scots? (Both were keen golfers.)
    Bernoulli believed that for rational decision making to be possible, there must
    be a reliable and mathematical way to determine probabilities. His view reflected
    the culture of the times, in which to conduct one’s affairs in a manner that was
    consistent with probabilistic expectation was considered the mark of a reasonable
    person. But it was not just subjectivity that, in Bernoulli’s opinion, limited
    the old theory of randomness. He also recognized that the theory was not designed
    for situations of ignorance, in which the probabilities of various outcomes could
    be defined in principle but in practice were not known. It is the issue I discussed
    with Moshe and that Jagger had to address: What are the odds that an imperfect
    die will come up with a 6? What are your chances of contracting the plague? What
    is the probability that your breastplate can withstand a thrust from your opponent’s
    long sword? In both subjective and uncertain situations, Bernoulli believed it

    the underlying probabilities, and with what level of confidence? We’ll return
    to those questions in the next chapter, but they are not quite the questions Bernoulli
    was able to answer. Instead, he answered a closely related question: how well
    are underlying probabilities reflected in actual results? Bernoulli considered
    it obvious that we are justified in expecting that as we increase the number of
    trials, the observed frequencies will reflect—more and more accurately—their underlying
    probabilities. He certainly wasn’t the first to believe that. But he was the first
    to give the issue a formal treatment, to turn the idea into a proof, and to quantify

    the English and many of the French from Newton’s. From the modern standpoint there
    is very little difference between the two, but in the long run Newton’s contribution

    here for convenience, but the same argument holds for a mile or any other measure.)
    Before she arrives there, she first must arrive at the halfway point. But in order
    to reach the halfway point, she must first arrive halfway to the halfway point—that
    is, at the one-quarter-way point. And so on, ad infinitum. In other words, in
    order to reach her destination, she must travel this sequence of distances: ¹/[2]
    meter, ¹/[4] meter, ¹/[8] meter, ¹/[16] meter, and so on. Zeno argued that because
    the sequence goes on forever, she has to traverse an *infinite* number of *finite*

    is allowed to move at constant speed without pausing at Zeno’s imaginary checkpoints—and
    why not?—then the time it takes to travel each of Zeno’s intervals is proportional

    given by his formula to be of practical use. Unfortunately, in most practical
    applications it isn’t. For instance, here is a numerical example Bernoulli worked
    out himself, although I have changed the context: Suppose 60 percent of the voters
    in Basel support the mayor. How many people must you poll for the chances to be
    99.9 percent that you will find the mayor’s support to be between 58 percent and
    62 percent—that is, for the result to be accurate within plus or minus 2 percent?
    (Assume, in order to be consistent with Bernoulli, that the people polled are
    chosen at random, but with replacement. In other words, it is possible that you
    poll a person more than once.) The answer is 25,550, which in Bernoulli’s time
    was roughly the entire population of Basel. That this number was impractical wasn’t
    lost on Bernoulli. He also knew that accomplished gamblers can intuitively guess
    their chances of success at a new game based on a sample of far fewer than thousands

    answer (an answer that differed more than 2 percent from the true one) less than
    1 time in 1,000\. That is a very demanding standard. Bernoulli called it moral
    certainty, meaning the degree of certainty he thought a reasonable person would
    require in order to make a rational decision. It is perhaps a measure of how much
    the times have changed that today we’ve abandoned the notion of moral certainty

  zh: 不。正如前面的分析所示，即使首席执行官们都有60%的成功率，在特定的五年期间，一个特定首席执行官的表现反映出这种潜在率的概率也只有1/3！转换到《财富》500强，这意味着在过去五年中，大约有333位首席执行官的表现没有反映出他们的真实能力。此外，我们应预期，仅凭偶然，大约有1/10的首席执行官将连续五年赢或输。这告诉我们什么？通过分析能力来判断人比仅仅看成绩单更可靠。或者，如伯努利所说，“人们不应根据其结果来评价人类行为。”

- en: Going against the law of small numbers requires character. For while anyone
    can sit back and point to the bottom line as justification, assessing instead
    a person’s actual knowledge and actual ability takes confidence, thought, good
    judgment, and, well, guts. You can’t just stand up in a meeting with your colleagues
    and yell, “Don’t fire her. She was just on the wrong end of a Bernoulli series.”
    Nor is it likely to win you friends if you stand up and say of the gloating fellow
    who just sold more Toyota Camrys than anyone else in the history of the dealership,
    “It was just a random fluctuation.” And so it rarely happens. Executives’ winning
    years are attributed to their brilliance, explained retroactively through incisive
    hindsight. And when people don’t succeed, we often assume the failure accurately
    reflects the proportion with which their talents and their abilities fill the
    urn.

  zh: 违反小数定律需要性格。因为虽然任何人都可以坐下来指着底线作为理由，但评估一个人的实际知识和实际能力则需要自信、思考、良好的判断力，以及，嗯，勇气。你不可能在会议上站起来对同事大喊，“不要解雇她。她只是站在了伯努利序列的错误一端。”如果你站起来说，刚刚卖掉比任何人都多的丰田凯美瑞的那位洋洋得意的家伙，“这只是随机波动。”这也不太可能赢得你的朋友。所以这种情况很少发生。高管们成功的年份被归功于他们的才华，通过敏锐的回顾性解释来解释。而当人们没有成功时，我们常常认为失败准确地反映了他们的才华和能力填充罐子的比例。
- en: Another mistaken notion connected with the law of large numbers is the idea
    that an event is more or less likely to occur because it has or has not happened
    recently. The idea that the odds of an event with a fixed probability increase
    or decrease depending on recent occurrences of the event is called the gambler’s
    fallacy. For example, if Kerrich landed, say, 44 heads in the first 100 tosses,
    the coin would not develop a bias toward tails in order to catch up! That’s what
    is at the root of such ideas as “her luck has run out” and “He is due.” That does
    not happen. For what it’s worth, a good streak doesn’t jinx you, and a bad one,
    unfortunately, does not mean better luck is in store. Still, the gambler’s fallacy
    affects more people than you might think, if not on a conscious level then on
    an unconscious one. People expect good luck to follow bad luck, or they worry
    that bad will follow good.

  zh: 与大数定律相关的另一个错误观念是，一个事件更有可能发生或不太可能发生，因为它最近发生了或没有发生。一个事件具有固定概率，其概率根据事件最近的发生与否而增加或减少的观念被称为赌徒谬误。例如，如果Kerrich在前100次投掷中得到了44次正面，硬币不会偏向反面以赶上！这就是“她的运气已经用完了”和“他该赢了”这类想法的根源。这种情况不会发生。就其价值而言，一段好运气不会给你带来厄运，一段坏运气，不幸的是，也不意味着好运即将到来。尽管如此，赌徒谬误影响的人比你想象的要多，如果不是在意识层面上，那么在无意识层面上。人们期望好运随后接踵而至，或者他们担心好运之后会接踵而至。
- en: I remember, on a cruise a few years back, watching an intense pudgy man sweating
    as he frantically fed dollars into a slot machine as fast as it would take them.
    His companion, seeing me eye them, remarked simply, “He is due.” Although tempted
    to point out that, *no, he isn’t due,* I instead walked on. After several steps
    I halted my progress owing to a sudden flashing of lights, ringing of bells, not
    a little hooting on the couple’s part, and the sound of, for what seemed like
    minutes, a fast stream of dollar coins flying out of the machine’s chute. Now
    I know that a modern slot machine is computerized, its payoffs driven by a random-number
    generator, which by both law and regulation must truly generate, as advertised,
    random numbers, making each pull of the handle completely independent of the history
    of previous pulls. And yet…Well, let’s just say the gambler’s fallacy is a powerful
    illusion.

- en: THE MANUSCRIPT in which Bernoulli presented his golden theorem ends abruptly
    even though he promises earlier in the work that he will provide applications
    to various issues in civic affairs and economics. It is as if “Bernoulli literally
    quit when he saw the number 25,550,” wrote the historian of statistics Stephen
    Stigler.[^(20)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c05-nts20a) In fact, Bernoulli
    was in the process of publishing his manuscript when he died “of a slow fever”
    in August 1705, at the age of fifty. His publishers asked Johann Bernoulli to
    complete it, but Johann refused, saying he was too busy. That may appear odd,
    but the Bernoullis were an odd family. If you were asked to choose the most unpleasant
    mathematician who ever lived, you wouldn’t be too far off if you fingered Johann
    Bernoulli. He has been variously described in historical texts as jealous, vain,
    thin-skinned, stubborn, bilious, boastful, dishonest, and a consummate liar. He
    accomplished much in mathematics, but he is also known for having his son Daniel
    tossed out of the Académie des Sciences after Daniel won a prize for which Johann
    himself had competed, for attempting to steal both his brother’s and Leibniz’s
    ideas, and for plagiarizing Daniel’s book on hydrodynamics and then faking the
    publication date so that his book would appear to have been published first.

  zh: 伯努利在其中的手稿中提出了他的黄金定理，但结尾突然中断，尽管他之前在作品中承诺将提供应用于公民事务和经济问题的应用。历史学家、统计学家斯蒂芬·斯蒂格勒写道，这就像“伯努利在看到数字25550时，字面上就放弃了。”实际上，伯努利在1705年8月因“慢性发热”去世，享年五十岁。他的出版商请求约翰·伯努利完成手稿，但约翰拒绝了，说他太忙了。这看起来可能有些奇怪，但伯努利家族就是一个奇怪的家族。如果你被要求选择有史以来最令人不快的数学家，如果你指的就是约翰·伯努利，你也不会离得太远。他在历史文献中被描述为嫉妒、自负、敏感、固执、易怒、自吹自擂、不诚实和彻头彻尾的骗子。他在数学上取得了许多成就，但他也因为将他的儿子丹尼尔从科学院赶出去而闻名，丹尼尔赢得了约翰自己也曾竞争过的奖项，因为他试图窃取他哥哥和莱布尼茨的想法，以及剽窃丹尼尔的流体力学书籍，然后伪造出版日期，使他的书看起来是首先出版的。
- en: When he was asked to complete his late brother’s manuscript, he had recently
    relocated to Basel from the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, obtaining
    a post not in mathematics but as a professor of Greek. Jakob had found this career
    change suspicious, especially since in his estimation Johann did not know Greek.
    What Jakob suspected, he wrote Leibniz, was that Johann had come to Basel to usurp
    Jakob’s position. And, indeed, upon Jakob’s death, Johann did obtain it.

  zh: 当他被要求完成他已故哥哥的手稿时，他刚刚从荷兰的格罗宁根大学搬到巴塞尔，获得了一个不是数学教授而是希腊语教授的职位。雅各布认为这种职业转变可疑，特别是在他看来，约翰并不懂希腊语。雅各布怀疑的是，他写信给莱布尼茨说，约翰来到巴塞尔是为了篡夺雅各布的职位。确实，在雅各布去世后，约翰获得了这个职位。
- en: Johann and Jakob had not gotten along for most of their adult lives. They would
    regularly trade insults in mathematics publications and in letters that, one mathematician
    wrote, “bristle with strong language that is usually reserved for horse thieves.”[^(21)](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#c05-nts21a)
    And so when the need arose to edit Jakob’s posthumous manuscript, the task fell
    further down the food chain, to Jakob’s nephew Nikolaus, the son of one of Jakob’s
    other brothers, also named Nikolaus. The younger Nikolaus was only eighteen at
    the time, but he had been one of Jakob’s pupils. Unfortunately he didn’t feel
    up to the task, possibly in part because he was aware of Leibniz’s opposition
    to his uncle’s ideas about applications of the theory. And so the manuscript lay
    dormant for eight years. The book was finally published in 1713 under the title
    *Ars conjectandi,* or *The Art of Conjecture.* Like Pascal’s *Pensées,* it is
    still in print.

    因此，当需要编辑雅各布的遗著时，这项任务落在了食物链的更低一层，落在了雅各布的一个兄弟的儿子尼古拉斯·尼古拉斯身上。年轻的尼古拉斯当时只有十八岁，但他曾是雅各布的学生。不幸的是，他觉得自己无法胜任这项任务，可能部分原因是他意识到莱布尼茨反对他叔叔关于理论应用的观点。因此，这份手稿就闲置了八年。这本书最终在1713年以《Ars
    conjectandi》或《猜想的艺术》为标题出版。就像帕斯卡的《思想录》一样，它至今仍在印刷。
