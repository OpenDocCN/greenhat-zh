    rock, and in this chapter you will find out about those musical talents that your
    system possesses. You will learn how to rip CDs, create MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files
    (files that you can recognize by their *.mp3* and *.ogg* filename extensions),
    add album cover art, change file tags, play music files, and burn files onto audio
    CDs that you can play in any CD player. You'll also learn how to play a variety
    of audio streams. If you're interested in learning how to work with your iPod,
    iPhone, or other digital media device, or how to convert audio files from one
    format to another, well, you'll have to wait until [Chapter 15](ch15.html "Chapter 15. PLUGGIN'
    IN THE PENGUIN").

- en: Before we go any further, it is probably best to discuss the various formats
    in which audio data can be stored on your computer. For the longest time, the
    de facto standards have been WAV (created by Microsoft/IBM and using the *.wav*
    extension), AU (from Sun/Unix and using the *.au* extension), and AIFF (from Apple
    and using the *.aiff* extension), all of which are uncompressed formats. Files
    saved in these formats are, therefore, exceedingly large, with an average WAV
    file of CD-quality music weighing in at about 10MB per minute. To put that in
    perspective, back in 1988 my first Macintosh had a 40MB hard disk—more space than
    I thought I would ever need but not enough space to store a WAV file of Nirvana's
    "Come as You Are."

- en: As computers underwent their evolution into the multimedia machines they are
    today, it became clear that something was going to have to be done about those
    disk-space-devouring audio files. Audio compression formats were thus developed.
    These compression formats work, to oversimplify things a bit, by cutting out the
    portions of a sound signal that the human ear cannot hear—sort of a dog-whistle
    approach. The most widely known and embraced of these audio compression formats
    is MP3\. Audio files encoded in MP3 format can end up being as little as one-twelfth
    the size of the original WAV file without any noticeable loss in quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another audio compression format that was developed was Ogg Vorbis. Ogg Vorbis
    was a product of the open source community, so, unlike MP3, which has always been
    used under the shadow of yet-to-be-exercised patent rights, it was free of patent
    and licensing worries from the get-go. Because of that and the fact that it was
    the equal of MP3 in terms of quality and performance (if not, as many claim, better),
    Ogg Vorbis became the darling of the Linux community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you work with ripping audio files in this chapter, you are sure to notice
    yet another encoding option—FLAC. Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is an encoding
    format that, unlike the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats, does not remove any audio
    information from the audio file during the encoding process. The downside of this
    is that FLAC provides space savings of only 30 to 50 percent, which is much less
    than the 80 percent neighborhood achieved by MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. The upside, of
    course, is that the FLAC files should be equivalent to CDs in terms of quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that retention of audio quality, FLAC becomes an ideal choice if you are
    not satisfied with the audio quality provided by Ogg Vorbis or MP3 files. It is
    also a good choice if you want to create both Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files . . . or
    if you just don't know which one you want to work with yet. In such cases, you
    can just rip the file and encode it in FLAC format. As I mentioned earlier, once
    you get to [Chapter 15](ch15.html "Chapter 15. PLUGGIN' IN THE PENGUIN"), you
    will learn how you can convert the FLAC file later, when you know what you want
    or need.

    like or need to deal with MP3 files. You may, for example, already have numerous
    MP3 files ripped from your music collection, or you may enjoy listening to one
    of the many Internet radio streams that are broadcast in MP3 format. Unfortunately,
    MP3 playback and encoding support is not included in Ubuntu because of licensing
    concerns. Even if you plan on using the Ogg Vorbis format in your future ripping
    and encoding endeavors, installing MP3 support is a good idea so as to cover all
    your audio bases. It's also a very easy process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The easiest way to install MP3 playback support is to double-click an MP3 file
    that you have on your hard disk. A window will appear, asking whether you want
    to search for the plug-ins necessary to play the file. Click **Search**, after
    which another window will appear, showing you what you need to install ([Figure 14-1](ch14s02.html#ubuntu_helps_you_find_the_plug-ins_you_n
    "Figure 14-1. Ubuntu helps you find the plug-ins you need.")). Check both boxes
    in that window, click the **Install** button, and in the confirmation window that
    then appears, click **Confirm**. You will then be asked for your password, so
    provide it, and then just wait until the process is complete. Once done, you'll
    be able to play not only your MP3 audio files but also MPEG and WMV videos.

    to search for and install *gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse*. If you also

    you want to add. If you want to add a number of albums by the same artist, just
    navigate to and select the folder for that artist instead. If you want to add

    you will have no trouble with on your own, because all you really have to do is
    click the button in the bottom-right corner of the window a few times. Once you

    Software Center's Sound & Video category will reveal. Check out Exaile, Banshee,
    Audacious, and Listen to get started. Oh, and as you'll find out in [Chapter 16](ch16.html
    "Chapter 16. COUCH PENGUINS"), if you haven't discovered it already, the Totem
    video player that comes with your system also doubles as an audio player. Wow.

    to you as Streamtuner ([Figure 14-10](ch14s07.html#browsing_internet_radio_streams_with_str
    "Figure 14-10. Browsing Internet radio streams with Streamtuner")). Streamtuner
    is, as its name implies, an online radio stream tuner. It works by downloading
    lists of available streams from a variety of sources, which you can then easily
    browse. When you find something you like, just select the stream, click the **Tune
    in** button, and the stream will open in the player of your choice. The default
    player for most streams is Audacious, so when you download Streamtuner, the Ubuntu
    Software Center will also automatically download Audacious, which is a pretty
    cool audio player. You can, however, switch the default player for Streamtuner
    playback by going to its **Edit** menu, selecting **Preferences**, and then in
    the right pane of the Preferences window, changing the default applications for
    playback by typing the command for the application you want to use. This is usually
    the name of the application in all lowercase letters. For example, if you want
    your playback to be from Totem, you would click **Listen to a .m3u file**, scroll
    to the right, and change `audacious %q` to **`totem %q`**.

    to (and even those you aren't listening to) and save them as MP3 files. To record
    a stream from within Streamtuner, just right-click the target stream, and select
    **Record** in the pop-up menu.

    two, but Audio Tag Tool ([Figure 14-11](ch14s07.html#editing_mp3_and_ogg_vorbis_file_tags_in

    friendlier user interface. Give 'em both a try and see what you think. Search
    the Ubuntu Software Center for *easytag* or *tagtool*, install one or both, and
    then locate either by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Sound & Video**, and then
    making the appropriate choice in the submenu.

    LMMS home page suggests. I can't swear to how easy it is to use, because I don't
    know much about apps in this genre. But there is a lot of hoopla about it in the
    Linux world, and it sure looks cool, as you can see in [Figure 14-12](ch14s07.html#creating_music_with_lmms

    demos once you install it). Search the Ubuntu Software Center for *lmms*, install
    the program, and run it by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Sound & Video** ▸ **Linux
    MultiMedia Studio**.

    audio recording and editing application that is frequently used not only in the

    paste bits of sound, raise pitch, increase speed, add echo and other effects,
    and . . . well, all sorts of other neat stuff. Get it via Ubuntu Software Center
    by doing a search for and then installing *audacity*. Audacity will then be available
    by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Sound & Video** ▸ **Audacity**.
