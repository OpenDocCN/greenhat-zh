<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre11">Welcome to the World of Linux</i><a name="22" id="22"/><a name="IDX-7" id="IDX-7"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now we begin our project to get you up  and running in the world of Linux. If you  have already made the commitment and have  Fedora Core installed on your machine, then  you are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have  made the commitment psychologically, but have yet to install anything on your computer. And some of you are probably reading these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering about Linux and about whether you  should spend your money on this book or on a latté every  morning for the next couple of weeks. For those in this  last group, I can only say, “Get this book.” Save the wear  and tear on your stomach and nerves.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In any case, the first thing we need to do is get you up to snuff on what this Fedora Core thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and what  you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions along the  way, and if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by the time you  finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, your doubts will be  gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. For the time being,  just relax, don’t worry, and go with the flow.</p>

<a name="23" class="calibre15" id="23"/><a name="wbp03Chapter1P5" class="calibre15" id="wbp03Chapter1P5"/>What Is Linux?</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is really  just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it can do  nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. In order for it to do anything else, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The OS takes an  essentially well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and  educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You already know of, and have probably used at least one of the many  operating systems that exist today. Windows, DOS, and the Mac OS are all such  operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different from  these other operating systems, both in terms of its capabilities and its heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wanna-bes out to  make money. It was instead created by a Swedish computer enthusiast living in  Finland, Linus Torvalds, who wanted to create a better Unix-like system that  would work on home computers, particularly his. Rather than keeping his  creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world, so to speak, and the  system was then expanded and improved on by compu-geeks around the globe  who worked to make the system better and more powerful.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Linux has acquired many fans and followers since its creation in 1994. Such  devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for its being robust,  reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is,  on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no  windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are  behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black- screen, command-line-driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as  DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing  in commands on a black screen, you don’t have to. It is fair to say that with the  advent of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,  pronounced goo-ee) in 1984, users of other operating systems began suffering  something akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their own,  and Windows, which gave DOS a GUI, eased many command-wary users into the  Microsoft world.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go  graphical, and various software mechanisms were developed by the community at  large to bring about the change. The graphical desktop environments that are  included in your Fedora Core distribution, GNOME and KDE, are examples of  the fruit of that development.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may have been wondering about the penguin in the chapter title, so I might  as well explain that now. The penguin is the Linux mascot, and his name is Tux  (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU0">Figure 1-1</a>). This explains not only the ornithological references and graphics throughout the book, but also why there are so many penguin icons in  Linux distributions and so many programs that include “penguin” or “Tux,” like  TuxRacer, XPenguins, and Pingus. This also explains why Linux users are  sometimes referred to as Penguinistas. </p>

<a name="27" class="calibre15" id="27"/><a name="wbp03Chapter1P14" class="calibre15" id="wbp03Chapter1P14"/>Why Should I Use Linux?</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">People use Linux for many different reasons. For many it is a matter of power,  stability, multilingual capabilities, or even personal philosophy. However, for  many others, crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money. Just think for a  moment about what it costs to get started up with another operating system. Go  to wherever it is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make a  list in your head of all the things you want to buy and how much each costs: an  office suite, a game or two, and maybe a graphics program with which to make  yourself look better in your digital photos. Now do the math.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After you pick yourself up off the floor, you will understand that we are  talking big bucks here. On the other hand, for the price of this book you will have all of those things you wanted and more in the Linux world. Despite the  worries that many people have, making the move to Linux means not only  savings for you, but also more computing versatility — you will not be hamstrung  at some point along the way because you don’t have this or that program when  you need it most — you’ll have it all from the get-go!<a name="28" id="28"/><a name="IDX-9" id="IDX-9"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You might counter with the fact that there are a lot of freeware applications  out there for other operating systems, but c’mon, let’s face it, these are often  rather limited in terms of their capabilities. The programs with a little more  oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these days are  limited in some way, or they only let you use them for a month or less, unless you  are willing to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, but $25 here and $35 there eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of change. In addition,  at least in my experience, the majority of such programs are hardly worth the  money asked. The only shareware program I ever found worth buying was Lemke  Software’s GraphicConverter for the Mac. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While money is important to the average user, it is certainly not the only reason  for taking the Linux plunge; there are a variety of other reasons as well. As I  mentioned before, Linux is noted for its stability. Try running your present  system for a month without restarting occasionally and see what happens. Linux  has been known to run for over a year without a hitch or decrease in performance. With its multilingual capabilities, Linux is also a perfect choice for  language students or users in a multilingual environment. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition, Linux is infinitely customizable: You can get your system to look and act the way you want it to without being wizarded to death. And then there  are the applications that come with most Linux distributions. In addition to  there being a wide variety of them, most are well up to industry snuff, with some,  such as Evolution and the GIMP, being sources of envy for those outside the  Linux world.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This question pops up quite often, and that’s fair enough. But consider this:  When you install a program on your present system and get an error message  saying that the program can’t run because some .dll file is missing, or when you  connect a piece of hardware and can’t get it to run, no one asks if that operating  system is ready for the desktop.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In my own experience, I have found no reason to doubt that Linux is ready.  Sure, Linux has its occasional quirks, but so does every other operating system. Linux is ready and able. If my mother, hardly a computer whiz, can do the work  she needs to do and can keep herself amused till the middle of the night using  her Linux system (without blowing the whole thing up), then I think it’s pretty  safe to say that you’ll do all right too. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different  functions. And because there is no Linux Corporation to package and distribute  the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen  to a varied group of entities — companies, universities, user groups, and even  private individuals. The Linux system and application collections they create are  called <i class="calibre11">distributions</i>, or <i class="calibre11">distros</i>. You could bypass such distros and try to collect  everything you’d need to set up a system all on your own, but you would  undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt for the distros.<a name="32" id="32"/><a name="IDX-10" id="IDX-10"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The majority of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience,  basically consist of the same main elements: the Linux kernel itself, some sort of  installer program to get all the system parts and applications properly installed  on your machine, the X Window System to provide graphical interface support,  one or more graphical desktop environments, and then a series of applications,  such as word processors, audio players, games, and all the other files needed to  make these things work.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared to a specific  audience, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, programmers, system  administrators, and specific language users. What makes each distro different is  the specific software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other  convenience features, such as the installer. Some distros are especially  appropriate for home users due to their ease of installation. Mandrake, SuSE,  and Fedora/Red Hat Linux are probably the three most popular in this regard,  with Fedora/Red Hat Linux being cited as having the most users in the American  market. While many of these entities charge for their distros, most also provide  them free for download.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="34" id="34"/><a name="IDX-11" id="IDX-11"/>Red Hat, the company, essentially had two different Linux product lines: a  consumer product for personal desktops and workstations (Red Hat Linux 8 and  9, for example), and a separate product for corporate users (Red Hat Enterprise  Edition). The corporate product is and always has been Red Hat’s cash cow, as  companies pay for the system on a subscription basis along with various support  services. The consumer version, despite its great popularity, was essentially a  money loser because most users would just download it for free, rather than buy it.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the first half of 2003, Red Hat announced that it would no longer package  and sell the consumer product as a boxed item, and instead set it off as a semi- autonomous unit under the Red Hat umbrella called the Red Hat Linux Project.  The new project would continue producing the consumer version, but as a totally  free product developed by the project with Linux community involvement. Most  saw this as a positive move, as it would allow greater input into and more rapid  development of the distribution. Work then progressed on what most people  were then calling Red Hat Linux 10.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Shortly after the establishment of the Red Hat Linux Project, however, work  began on a merger between that project and another completely separate  community project, the Fedora Linux Project. The Fedora Linux Project, rather  than building a distribution of its own, worked to prepare application packages  (RPMs) for use with Red Hat Linux. As the goals of the two projects were  overlapping, the two projects merged. The result is the Fedora Project, which is  still under the Red Hat umbrella. Rather than continue using the name Red Hat  Linux, however, the Fedora Project opted to use the more all-encompassing  name <i class="calibre11">Fedora Core</i> as the name of its distribution.<a name="35" id="35"/><a name="IDX-12" id="IDX-12"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fedora Core, at this point, is essentially what Red Hat Linux 10 was going to  be, just with a new name. It is hardly a startling departure from what has come  before. Red Hat Linux 8 and 9 users should feel completely at home with  Fedora Core, as it retains the look, feel, and functionality of Red Hat Linux 9. To paraphrase the folks at the project, changes will be evolutionary, not  revolutionary. This is certainly the case so far. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, with every new version release, there are a few changes, but other  than the updated Bluecurve theme and the inclusion of a couple of new applications, most of the changes will not be readily apparent.</p>

<a name="37" class="calibre15" id="37"/><a name="wbp03Chapter1P35" class="calibre15" id="wbp03Chapter1P35"/><i class="emphasis">Why Fedora Then?</i>
</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">With so many distros out there, you may wonder why you should opt for Fedora  Core. Well, I’ve tried quite a few distros, and Fedora Core is the one that pleased  me most. As for the reasons, they basically come down to these:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Ease of installation</b> The Mandrake distro is often cited as the easiest distro  to install, and perhaps in terms of setting up a dual-boot Windows/Linux system, that might be true to some degree. However, I have to give the nod to  Fedora. Though I do not advocate doing this, one could just press ENTER at  every stage of the Fedora Core installation process and end up with a perfectly usable system. What could be easier than that? Even if you screw up,  you don’t.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">RPM based</b> As you will soon learn, RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) provides a very easy way of installing additional software and related files. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">RPM availability</b> Perhaps because of its market share, there are many more  RPMs out there for Red Hat Linux and Fedora than for any other distro. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Dependable and robust</b> I know these terms come across as mere hype, but after you smack things around in your Fedora system a bit, particularly  when using GNOME, you come to understand what they mean. Knock  things down and around, and they bounce right back — this is very important for beginners who often have a knack for screwing things up. Nothing  turns a new user off more than a twitchy system that has to be velvet gloved  all the time.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Good selection of applications</b> Fedora Core comes with more applications  than you will know what to do with, and most are configured so that they will  work as soon as you run them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One last point worth mentioning is that the Fedora/Red Hat community of users is actually even larger than the number of people who use Fedora Core or Red  Hat Linux. Many other distros are actually Red Hat–based, meaning that they are  essentially Red Hat Linux distributions with all the Red Hat references and logos  being replaced and with certain software packages added or removed to customize the distro for its targeted audience. JAMD, Yellow Dog, and Alt Linux are  all Red Hat Linux–based distros. In theory, even <i class="calibre11">you</i> could create your own Red  Hat–based distro. Red Hat, the company, is pretty cool in that sense, and as the </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fedora Project is continuing that same policy, you could even create your own  Fedora-based distro and call it something like Boaz Linux, for example, once you  know what you are doing.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Well, enough of this background babble; it’s time to get things rolling. If you  haven’t installed Linux on your machine yet and are wondering whether you  can, it is relatively safe to say that Fedora Core will run on most machines out  there today. Of course, this statement comes with a major caveat: You just never  know till you get up and running. There are so many minor parts to your  machine that it is difficult to say whether each part will cooperate with your  installation. Ignoring peripheral devices for the time being, there are video cards, sound chips, LAN cards, monitors, and so on, and they all need to be  considered. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are really worried about compatibility, you can search the Web to see  if your hardware is supported by Linux. Of course, before you can do this, you  need to know what model of hardware you have. You should know at least what  motherboard, processor (CPU), and monitor you have if you want to be able to  find out anything of value. Identifying your CPU and monitor should be easy  enough, but the motherboard may require a bit more searching. If you have no  documentation that clearly states what kind of motherboard you have, then just  open up the case of your computer and look at your board. You needn’t worry  about damaging something because you don’t need to touch anything (so  don’t). You may need a flashlight to find it, but the model name and number  should be stamped on there somewhere, either in the middle of the board or  around the edges. Mine, for example, says quite clearly in the middle of the  board, “AOpen MX46-533V.” You should be looking for similar information.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have that information, you can do a variety of things to check out  your motherboard’s compatibility with Fedora Core. You can simply do a Yahoo  or Google search by typing in your motherboard’s make and model plus the  word “Linux.” This works for other hardware devices too. You can also post a  question to one of the various Linux forums or mailing lists on the Web. A listing  of some of these is provided in <a href="DDU0150_split_000.html#946" target="_parent">Appendix B</a> at the end of this book. Just write that  you are a newbie and want to know if anyone has had any experience using  Fedora Core or Red Hat Linux with the board (or other hardware) in question.  You will probably get quite a few responses. Linux users are usually rather  evangelical in terms of trying to draw in new users.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are going to buy a new machine to run Linux on, then it is reasonable  enough to check things out first, but if you are going to install it on the machine  you have, I recommend just diving in. Being the reckless character that I am, searching the Net to figure out whether things will work seems a bit of a nuisance  to me. You can spend hours poking around and still end up not being sure. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You might also be misled into thinking that Fedora Core won’t work on your  machine, when in fact it actually will. You can find out for sure by just trying to  install it. If it works, it works; and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. </p>

<a name="40" id="40"/><a name="IDX-13" id="IDX-13"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">All worries about compatibility aside, there are some minimum hardware  requirements that you will need, and thus want, to meet:</p>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Pentium II processor, 400 megahertz (MHz) or above for a graphic-mode system</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">About 3GB of hard disk space, though having at least 10GB would  be more comfy</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Sufficient memory (RAM)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I have a bit to say about RAM. The official specs tell you that you need a minimum of  192 megabytes (MB) to run Fedora Core (though 256MB is recommended to run it  comfortably). Yeah, right. That might do the trick if all you want to do is stare at your  desktop, but I have yet to find anyone who is inclined to do only that. This underestimation doesn’t mean that the folks at the Fedora Project are trying to  sucker you. It is just one of those OS things. The fact is that no matter what OS you  are dealing with, whether it be Windows or Macintosh or Linux, whatever they tell  you is enough memory is sure to be too little. My basic rule of thumb, no matter what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recommended (not the minimum)  memory plus at least 128MB. Regardless of what the official specs say, put in more.  You won’t regret it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Saying that the more memory you have, the better, may sound a bit simple, and  perhaps even cavalier, but trust me on this one. When you have too little memory, no matter what system you are running, weird things happen: applications seem to take  years to open, or don’t open at all; menus take forever to render their little icons;  and freezes and general system meltdowns just happen much more often. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To be realistic and exceedingly honest, I would say that 256MB is the absolute  minimum you want to have. I personally would recommend that you have at least  384MB of RAM in order for things to move smoothly and comfortably. It is such a  waste to have a pretty speedy CPU and not be able to appreciate it because its hands  are tied by a lack of memory. It is sort of like trying to do jumping jacks in a broom  closet. Sure you could do it, but you would be all contorted, and you’d be smashing  your hands into the walls every 1.4 seconds. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Memory is relatively cheap these days, so go for it. Since you’re saving money on applications by installing the Fedora Core system, you should have enough extra cash  to make your life easier. After all, a 128MB DIMM (memory chip) will set you back  less than $30, and a 256MB DIMM less than $45 (according to Hardware Planet,  <a target="_top" href="http://www.compwarehouse.com">www.compwarehouse.com,</a> and 18004 Memory, <a target="_top" href="http://www.18004memory.com">www.18004memory.com,</a> as I write  this). At those prices, just imagine how much memory you could buy for the price of  the most popular Windows Office suite. </p>
