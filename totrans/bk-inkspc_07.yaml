    that when you are transforming something in the vicinity of such a magnetic attractor,
    the object you’re transforming “snaps” into the exact desired position. *Arranging*
    moves a large number of objects in a regular way so that they are aligned, distributed,
    scattered, or lined up into a table exactly as you want them to be.'

- en: The easiest way to snap objects to alignment is by creating a guide, or guideline.
    *Guides* are visible, infinitely long straight lines on the canvas, but they are
    not objects. They cannot be selected, they don’t print, and they don’t show up
    on bitmap exports. Although they are saved with the document, they are not part
    of the SVG standard and are therefore invisible in SVG viewers other than Inkscape.
    They are just Inkscape-specific helpers for organizing your artwork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, guides may separate parts of your layout, helping you visualize
    the edges of the various areas or cells. A guide can be a centerline helping you
    draw symmetrically around it. Or you can use a guide to quickly check if several
    objects are *really* aligned or just *look* like they are.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create a guide, you must have rulers visible. (If you’ve hidden the rulers,
    display them with ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735484.png.jpg).)
    Click anywhere on a ruler and, without releasing the mouse, drag your cursor onto
    the canvas. You will see a new ruler appear which you can now drop (by releasing
    the mouse) where you want it. Naturally, dragging off the horizontal ruler creates
    *horizontal guides*, and dragging off the vertical ruler creates *vertical guides*;
    what’s more interesting, dragging from the very ends of the rulers creates *diagonal
    guides*, slanted (by default) at 45 degrees.

    Inkscape decides that the clutter is too much to bear and weeds the grid, switching
    to showing only every tenth grid line. Keep zooming out and this decimation of
    grid lines will happen again and again, so as to keep the grid manageable. As
    the default rectangular grid spacing is 1 px, at most zoom levels—if not for this
    adaptive hiding—the grid would cover the page so densely that you wouldn’t be

    all nodes that *want* to snap, snapping will happen for the node which is closest

    box as its anchor box (i.e., the **Relative to:** list does not affect the **Distribute**
    section of the dialog). In other words, distributing always preserves the bounding
    box of the selection because it never moves the leftmost and rightmost (for horizontal)
    or topmost and bottommost (for vertical) objects, but only those that fall between
    them. (One consequence of this is that distributing only makes sense for three
    or more selected objects.)
