    to know about paths in Inkscape. This chapter is smaller, but it has the potential
    to grow much larger in later editions as Inkscape continues to evolve. Path effects
    (**[13.1 Path Effects](ch13s01.html "13.1 Path Effects")**) first appeared in
    version 0.46; they are really taking off in version 0.47 and will likely grow
    even more in future versions. Extensions dealing with paths (**[13.3 Path Extensions](ch13s03.html
    "13.3 Path Extensions")**) are another area of continuing growth; in the future,
    some of them may be turned into path effects to improve interactivity and integration
    with the rest of the program.

    path—for example, rounding all corners, roughening it, blowing or pinching it.
    No matter which path effect you apply to a path, the *original* path before the
    effect can still be viewed and edited—and after you edit the original path, the
    *visible* path is automatically recalculated from it and from the effect parameters.'

    the handles or numeric parameters in their shape tools. Path effects don’t, however,
    apply to text objects, clones, or bitmaps. A path effect can be applied to a group,
    which gives the same result as if the effect was applied to all paths and shapes
    in the group *combined* (i.e., made subpaths of a single path).

    effects can be stacked on top of one another, so that the output of one effect

    a path with the **Knot** effect, switch to the Node tool, and notice that one
    of its self-intersections has a diamond-shaped handle and a green circular indicator
    which is open on one side. Click that handle; the indicator flips to the other
    side and the gap now affects the other line at the intersection. Click it again
    and you close the intersection removing any gaps; the indicator is now a solid
    circle. You can cycle through these three states of an intersection by clicking
    the handle. To control another intersection on your path, just drag the handle
    and drop near the intersection you need.

    Spiro splines are available as a path effect in Inkscape, which means you can
    use all the convenient Inkscape path tools (such as moving and transforming groups
    of nodes, node sculpting, etc.) on Spiro paths. The Pen and Pencil tools can produce

    is each node having not only a position but also its own intrinsic “direction”
    and “curvature,” as defined by its handles. So, whenever you move a Bézier node
    around, you also need to carefully adjust its handles so the curve still looks
    smooth and natural. With Spiros, you are freed of this requirement; just move
    the node wherever you want the curve to go, and the smoothness of the curve is
    taken care of automatically.

    new nodes between existing nodes itself, and then moves these new nodes (any Bézier
    handles in the original path are discarded) leaving all the original nodes in
    place. The **Subdivisions** parameter determines how many times each segment will
    be subdivided in two (caution: Increasing this value makes the node count grow
    exponentially—for example, 10 subdivisions turn a two-node path into one with
    1,025 nodes), whereas **Smoothness** changes how far the new nodes can move (lower
    **Smoothness** produces a rougher path). This effect is perfect for creating coastal

- en: This is a complex extension that draws a graph of an arbitrary function in Cartesian
    (rectangular) or polar coordinates. Before calling this extension, draw or select
    a rectangle that will define the scale of the graph; the first four numeric parameters
    define the ranges of the X and Y coordinates. The **Multiply X range by 2*pi**
    checkbox is convenient for trigonometric functions; when it’s checked, the X range
    of, for example, 0 to 2 is treated as 0 to 2 × π. The **Use polar coordinates**
    checkbox transforms the graph into a circle, centered at the center of the original
    rectangle, with the X range mapped to the angle and Y to the radius.

- en: The **Samples** parameter sets the total number of times the function will be
    sampled, at points equidistant on the X axis; since each sampling produces a node,
    this is also the total number of nodes in the generated path. The higher this
    number, the more precise the graph. The optimum number of samples, however, depends
    on the nature of your function; for example, if you’re using a periodic function
    with *n* periods in the X range, you will need at least several samples per period
    to reproduce it with any fidelity.

    of the function at that point is what determines the angle of the handles of that
    node. You can ask the extension to **Calculate first derivative numerically**,
    or you can uncheck that checkbox and provide the derivative function analytically,
    using the same Python syntax and built-in functions as for the function itself
    (for example, the first derivative of `sin(x)` is `cos(x)`).
