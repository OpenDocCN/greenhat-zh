- en: Many a Windows user has entered the Linux fold after a host of bad experiences
    with *malware* in the Windows world—viruses, spyware, and all sorts of other malicious
    bits of software too numerous to imagine. Windows is also plagued by a seemingly
    endless array of security vulnerabilities, leaving the system easy prey to invaders
    with less than noble intentions. Every trip into cyberspace thus becomes something
    like a run through the infectious diseases ward of a hospital. For a Windows user,
    it can sometimes seem that more time is spent ridding the system of viral pests
    and defending it from invaders than actually getting things done.

- en: Fortunately, Linux does not suffer greatly from such problems, leading to the
    much-touted claim that Linux is practically virus free and quite secure. Numerous
    lines of reasoning have been proffered to explain Linux’s malware- and exploit-resistant
    nature. One reason is simply popularity—or lack thereof. Because Linux is not
    as widespread a system as Windows is, it is also a much less attractive target
    for digital evildoers, who very often seem to be motivated by the challenge and
    headline-catching glory that comes with creating a truly global virus or finding
    a theretofore unknown backdoor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason is that Linux users, as a general rule, work on their computers
    in a nonprivileged mode, one in which the user does not have the right to install
    software without a password. This is not the case in some older versions of Windows.
    A virus or other form of malware attached to an email or piggybacked upon another
    file or application cannot, therefore, install itself in your Linux system without
    that password . . . well, theoretically, at least. Of course, now that more recent
    versions of Windows use a privilege structure similar to this by default, this
    point is a bit less of an issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also the matter of structural design. Every system has security holes
    that can be exploited by digital and human foe alike. Windows might well be called
    the Swiss cheese of operating systems in this regard. Of course, Linux has its
    holes too, though apparently far fewer of them than Windows does, and Linux generally
    plugs them through downloadable updates faster once they are found.

    you need to bother worrying about vulnerabilities at all. Well, if you take a
    look at the Ubuntu forums, you might find yourself a bit confused. When asked
    whether Linux users need to install antivirus software or firewalls, most users
    answer with an emphatic *no*. On the other hand, you’ll find that an awful lot
    of people have installed or are trying to install that software. Hmm.

    machines, you might want to think about installing some antivirus soft-ware, if
    to achieve nothing more than the good of the Windows systems involved and the
    users of those systems—your unenlightened (that is, Windows-using) email pals,
    for example. You might also want to give it a go if you are, by nature, on the
    cautious side of the spectrum. Basically, if it makes you feel safer to install
    some protection, go ahead. If it makes you feel safer to go whole-hog and install
    the full line of defense mechanisms I cover in this chapter, go ahead. After all,
    either way, it isn’t going to cost you anything, and it certainly isn’t going
    to hurt you. On the other hand, you’ll prob-ably be fine without installing any
    of the software described here too.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of the system you happen to be using (though I am assuming that you
    have become a Linux devotee by now), the first line of defense for any computer
    permanently hooked up to the Internet is a *router*—an electronic device that
    allows a number of computers on a local network (such as in your home or at your
    office) to connect to and share a single connection from your Internet service
    provider (ISP). The router is connected to your Internet connection via cable,
    but the connection from the router to the computers on your local network can
    be wired, wireless, or both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does a router have to do with the defense of your computer? Well, most
    routers include a *firewall*, which essentially functions to keep all of the bad
    stuff on the Web away from your computer, much in the way that the firewall in
    your car keeps the heat, fumes, and noise from your engine out of the passenger
    compartment. This built-in firewall is one reason that even people with only one
    computer, who could just as easily connect directly to a cable or DSL modem, use
    a router. Of course, just how much security the firewall in your router provides
    depends on which filters you select in the firewall setup software. For example,
    a very common and useful filter (particularly for those with a wireless network)
    limits Internet access to those computers specified on the firewall’s access list.
    This prevents your next-door neighbors from hitching a wireless ride via your
    ISP connection. They aren’t paying the bill, after all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The setup software for a router is built into the router, so you don’t have
    to worry about software installation and system compatibility. Using your router
    with Linux is no different from using it with Windows. You can access the software
    and modify your settings via a simple web browser, as you can see in [Figure 20-1](ch20.html#setting_up_a_router
    "Figure 20-1. Setting up a router"). Just type the IP address of the router (usually
    provided in the owner’s manual) in the browser’s location bar, press enter, and
    you’ll be ready to go.

    Firestarter.

    would prefer to do things graphically. After all, you don’t *have* to type commands
    to delete or move a file, right? That’s where BleachBit comes in. BleachBit ([Figure 20-9](ch20.html#using_bleachbit_to_guard_your_privacy
    "Figure 20-9. Using BleachBit to guard your privacy")) is an application that
    helps guard your privacy in a number of ways—not least by shredding all manner
    of things for you. Here are the steps you need to follow to shred a file:'

    The defaults are good enough for our purposes, so just click **Close**.

    **File** ▸ **Shred Files** and choose the file you want to shred (hold down ctrl
    to select multiple files). Take care not to select the wrong file, since you won’t
    be able to recover it post-shredding! Click **Delete**. You’ll be asked to confirm
    the deletion. This is the point of no return so, if you’re happy to proceed, click
    **Delete** to finish the job.

    BleachBit, aside from shredding the odd file. The list on the left of the main
    BleachBit window contains all sorts of weird and wonderful ways of securely deleting
    some of the personal information that’s probably lurking on your computer. Take
    Firefox, for example: Click the Firefox list item in the BleachBit list, and an
    information page will appear in the main pane, telling you how BleachBit can securely
    remove various information kept by Firefox.'

    you’d have to do is press the Clean button at the top of the window to delete
    all of the web cookies that Firefox has accumulated. Easy, huh?
