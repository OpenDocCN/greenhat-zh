With a little research and creativity, however, even the most cash-strapped would-be Internet surfer can get a computer and load it with software for nothing, or next to nothing.</p><div class="sect1" title="Internet Comparison Shopping"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="internet_comparison_shopping"/>Internet Comparison Shopping</h1></div></div></div><p>Whether you want a new camera, computer, printer, scanner, or whatever, you should never pay full retail price for any high-tech or electronics product you find online. Before buying, shop around.</p><p>In the old days, shopping around meant driving countless hours to different stores to compare prices. Nowadays, by visiting the right shopping search engines, you can comparison shop among retailers all over the country without doing anything more exhausting than typing on a keyboard.</p><p>Shopping search engines, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#a_shopping_search_engine_comma_such_as_m" title="Figure 21-1. A shopping search engine, such as mySimon, can compare prices from different retailers and even calculate the total cost of an order, including sales tax and shipping.">Figure 21-1</a>, help you find the best price for a particular item and often include reviews of the product itself, evaluations of the retailer's customer service, and a list of similar products you might want to consider instead. A low price might seem attractive, but if it's coming from a retailer with a poor record for shipping products on time or responding to complaints of defective merchandise, you might want to take your business to a more confidence-inspiring merchant and pay a slightly higher price.</p><p>Some popular shopping search engines include Froogle (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.froogle.com">www.froogle.com</a>), Kelkoo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kelkoo.co.uk">www.kelkoo.co.uk</a>), MSN Shopping (<a class="ulink" href="http://shopping.msn.com">http://shopping.msn.com</a>), and Yahoo Shopping (<a class="ulink" href="http://shopping.yahoo.com">http://shopping.yahoo.com</a>).</p><p>These shopping search engines compare prices for different products, but the order in which they list the retailers that match a query can be critical. The first five retailers listed in search results often get the most business, regardless of price. Knowing this, many retailers pay an additional fee to get listed at the top of the search results in the hopes of increasing potential sales. As an alternative, consider using PriceScan (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pricescan.com">www.pricescan.com</a>), which refuses to accept fees to increase a retailer's standing on its list of results.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_shopping_search_engine_comma_such_as_m"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e14589"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676749.png.jpg" alt="A shopping search engine, such as mySimon, can compare prices from different retailers and even calculate the total cost of an order, including sales tax and shipping."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-1. A shopping search engine, such as mySimon, can compare prices from different retailers and even calculate the total cost of an order, including sales tax and shipping.</p></div><p>To save even more money, visit Woot!

Sites like Amazon.com let buyers rate different merchants for speed, reliability, and dependability. If a merchant offers a low price but has a spotty record with other buyers, you may want to avoid that merchant and pay more from a more reliable merchant instead.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Buying a Refurbished Computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="buying_a_refurbished_computer"/>Buying a Refurbished Computer</h1></div></div></div><p>Any of the shopping search engines listed in the Internet Comparison Shopping section will help you find the best prices for new computer equipment, but to save even more, consider buying a refurbished computer instead.</p><p>Refurbished computers are machines that someone returned either because of a defect or because they didn't want it any longer even though it may have been working perfectly well. Once a manufacturer receives a returned computer, it's torn apart, the components are tested, and then it's reassembled to be just like new. There's just one problem. Legally, manufacturers can't sell a returned computer as new.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0003" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since the manufacturer has already lost money accepting a returned computer for resale, they'll reduce the price significantly just to get rid of it. If the computer were to fail a second time and force another customer to return it, the manufacturer would lose still more money fixing it again, so refurbished computers are often examined even more carefully than new ones are.</p><p>If you don't mind getting a computer that someone else may have used already, a refurbished computer can be a great way to get a top-of-the-line machine without paying top-of-the-line prices. Refurbished computers come with the same technical support and warranty as their identical brand-new models, but with one major drawback. When you buy a refurbished computer, you can only buy what the manufacturer has in stock that day. If you want to customize your computer, you'll probably have to splurge on something new or be prepared to buy the accessories you want and install them yourself.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You won't find refurbished computers for sale at your favorite store, however. Most computer manufacturers only sell them on retail sites such as Amazon.com (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>), Dell Computers (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dell.com/factoryoutlet">www.dell.com/factoryoutlet</a>), Gateway (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gateway.com">www.gateway.com</a>), Overstock.com (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.overstock.com">www.overstock.com</a>), PC Factory Outlet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pcfactoryoutlet.com">www.pcfactoryoutlet.com</a>), PC Nomad (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pcnomad.com">www.pcnomad.com</a>) and SonyStyle (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sonystyle.com">www.sonystyle.com</a>).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some people may use a computer and then return it later, which means a refurbished computer might still have someone else's data on the hard disk that you can undelete and peek at. See <a class="xref" href="ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Computer Forensics: The Art of Deleting and Retrieving Data">Chapter 22</a> for more information about recovering deleted data.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Save on Printer Supplies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="save_on_printer_supplies"/>Save on Printer Supplies</h1></div></div></div><p>Almost everyone needs a printer, but watch out. Many printer manufacturers seduce you with low prices on their inkjet models only to gouge you on replacement ink cartridges. The cost of two or three ink cartridges can be as much as the original price of the printer itself, and inkjet printers tend to suck up ink rapidly.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A program dubbed Ink Saver (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.inksaver.com">www.inksaver.com</a>), shown in <a class="xref" href="ch21s03.html#inksaver_keeps_track_of_how_much_ink_you" title="Figure 21-2. InkSaver keeps track of how much ink you're saving every time you adjust the flow.">Figure 21-2</a>, claims to reduce the amount of ink your printer uses without any noticeable difference in print quality. Ink Saver is compatible with most Epson, Canon, and Hewlett-Packard printers, but you can download a trial version to see if it works with your particular inkjet printer.</p><div class="figure"><a id="inksaver_keeps_track_of_how_much_ink_you"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e14674"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676751.png.jpg" alt="InkSaver keeps track of how much ink you're saving every time you adjust the flow."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-2. InkSaver keeps track of how much ink you're saving every time you adjust the flow.</p></div><p>No matter how much ink a program like Ink Saver can help you conserve, you'll eventually need to buy replacement inkjet cartridges. Instead of getting them from the printer manufacturer, buy refill kits or alternate inkjet cartridges from Amazon Imaging (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazonimaging.com">www.amazonimaging.com</a>) or RhinoTek (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.buyrhinotek.com">www.buyrhinotek.com</a>). To find more online retailers that sell replacement inkjet, visit Buy Ink <a class="ulink" href="http://cartridges.com">Cartridges.com</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.buyinkcartridges.com">www.buyinkcartridges.com</a>). These third-party inkjet companies sell refill kits and replacement cartridges for most printers at up to half of what the original manufacturers would charge for the exact same thing.</p><p>If you're shopping for an inkjet printer, compare the prices of replacement cartridges first. The printer that looks so appealing today might wind up costing you several hundred dollars in the future for replacement inkjet cartridges alone. Look for the cheapest cartridges and then find the printers that work with them.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0007" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To foil the companies that offer cheap replacement cartridges, printer manufacturers have come up with several tactics to force consumers to buy inkjet cartridges only from them. Hewlett-Packard puts computer chips in inkjet cartridges to prevent them from being refilled. The moment a cartridge runs out of ink, the chip prevents it from ever being used again, no matter how much you refill it with replacement ink, although you can buy new chips from SmartChipSolutions (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.smartchipsolutions.com">www.smartchipsolutions.com</a>) to trick your printer into accepting a third-party replacement ink cartridge. However, Lexmark and Hewlett-Packard have also even patented the print heads on certain inkjet cartridges, thereby preventing anyone from making a compatible replacement cartridge. If you can't find a replacement inkjet cartridge for your printer from a third party, now you know why.</p><p>If you have a laser printer, don't throw away your old toner cartridges. Check your local Yellow Pages under computer supplies and look for stores (or contact Amazon Imaging) that refill or sell used cartridges for your particular model.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Free (and Almost-Free) Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="free_open_parenthesis_and_almost-free_cl"/>Free (and Almost-Free) Software</h1></div></div></div><p>The two main types of software available are commercial and open source. Commercial software costs money, although in the case of shareware or adware-sponsored programs, that cost may be minimal. Open-source software is free. You can copy open-source programs as many times as you wish and even modify them, if you know what you're doing. In many cases, open-source programs rival the features of their commercial counterparts, but don't overlook commercial programs completely. There are ways of getting commercial software much cheaper than you might think.</p><div class="sect2" title="Getting commercial software cheaply (and legally)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_commercial_software_cheaply_open"/>Getting commercial software cheaply (and legally)</h2></div></div></div><p>It's easy to pirate software (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Warez (Software Piracy)">Chapter 6</a>), but it's not a practical (or legal) option for most people. Before you buy anything, try one of the following methods to get that same program for free or at a lower cost.</p><div class="sect3" title="Bundled software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="bundled_software"/>Bundled software</h3></div></div></div><p>Many hardware manufacturers bundle "free" software with their products to entice customers. Most computers come with a preloaded operating system (such as Windows XP) but many companies include additional software too. For example, Sony computers often include digital video software, while other computer manufacturers offer WordPerfect or Microsoft Works with their systems.</p><p>Similarly, scanner companies typically bundle graphics editing programs or optical character recognition software, external hard disk manufacturers offer free backup software, and rewritable CD/DVD drives often include disk-burning programs. Bundled software is often a scaled-down or older version of a current application program, but if it's got the features you need, a bundling deal could convince you to buy one manufacturer's equipment over another.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Buying obsolete software, upgrades, and OEM versions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="buying_obsolete_software_comma_upgrades"/>Buying obsolete software, upgrades, and OEM versions</h3></div></div></div><p>Bundled software can be valuable because it gives you the legal right to purchase an upgrade, which means that, for a minimal cost, you can buy the full version of a program without paying the full cost of a new version. If you don't have any older software bundled with your computer equipment, you can often buy it at deeply discounted prices through online retailers such as <a class="ulink" href="http://oldsoftware.com">Oldsoftware.com</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.oldsoftware.com">www.oldsoftware.com</a>), Software &amp; Stuff (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.softwareandstuff.com">www.softwareandstuff.com</a>), DirectDeals (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.directdeals.com">www.directdeals.com</a>), and Software Outlet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.softwareoutlet.com">www.softwareoutlet.com</a>).</p><p>Older software can work perfectly well while saving you up to 90 percent off the retail cost of the latest version. If you still want the newest version, buy an older one and then pay for the upgrade. The total cost for the older version, plus the upgrade, will almost always be less than you would've paid to get the full version right off the bat.</p><p>Another way to get the latest version of a program is to buy the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version. Many software publishers bundle their latest programs with a variety of hardware, but you can find online retailers selling these OEM versions separately. An OEM program is identical to the retail package but without the fancy box and sometimes without the (nearly useless) printed manual. <a class="xref" href="ch21s04.html#oem_programs_are_the_same_as_the_full_re" title="Figure 21-3. OEM programs are the same as the full retail versions but without the fancy packaging.">Figure 21-3</a> shows the price savings you can enjoy on OEM versions of some popular programs.</p><div class="figure"><a id="oem_programs_are_the_same_as_the_full_re"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e14753"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676753.png.jpg" alt="OEM programs are the same as the full retail versions but without the fancy packaging."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 21-3. OEM programs are the same as the full retail versions but without the fancy packaging.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Buying software at academic discounts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="buying_software_at_academic_discounts"/>Buying software at academic discounts</h3></div></div></div><p>School bookstores usually sell academic versions of nearly all major software at a substantial discount because software publishers want to get students hooked on using their products instead of a competitor's. So a program that normally costs $495 might be sold at a university bookstore for $100.</p><p>Of course, the catch is that you must have a valid student ID to take advantage of offers from a university bookstore. If you know someone currently in college, ask him to buy the software for you (and in exchange, you can buy him beer). As another alternative, just sign up for one class, get your student ID, and use your student ID to buy all the software you want at academic discounts.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-21-0009" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Shareware and freeware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="shareware_and_freeware"/>Shareware and freeware</h3></div></div></div><p>Shareware programs let you freely copy and use a program for a trial period, usually 30 days, after which it may stop working unless you pay up. Surprisingly, shareware programs are often just as good (or even better) than their higher-priced, brand-name counterparts, and no matter what type of a program you need (virus scanner, word processor, paint program, and so on), you can almost always find a good shareware version.<a id="IDX-CHP-21-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Freeware programs are given away—you can legally use and own them without ever paying. Some freeware is software that has been abandoned by its manufacturer or is a scaled-down version of a program that's intended to help market the commercial version. The idea is that if you like the freeware version, you might want to upgrade to the commercial version later to get more features.

For that reason, many customers, especially businesses, prefer the security of having someone they can call for help (or someone they can blame).</p><p>When evaluating commercial software, it's often cheaper to avoid the most popular programs and use a lesser-known but equally competent rival program instead. For example, the retail price for the standard edition of Microsoft Office is $399, but consider any of the following less expensive alternatives: WordPerfect Suite ($299)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.corel.com">www.corel.com</a>, StarOffice ($69.95)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sun.com">www.sun.com</a>, or ThinkFree Office ($49.95)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.thinkfree.com">www.thinkfree.com</a>.</p><p>Or how about this. The full retail price for Photoshop is $649, but look at these less expensive alternatives: Photoshop Elements ($99.95)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a>—or Corel Paint Shop Pro ($129)—<a class="ulink" href="http://www.corel.com">www.corel.com</a>.</p><p>Lower-cost name-brand alternatives may not offer all the features of a more established program, but they do offer almost perfect compatibility with those expensive programs' file formats. If you don't absolutely need Microsoft Word, for example, why waste your money paying for it?</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding an open-source program"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_an_open-source_program"/>Finding an open-source program</h2></div></div></div><p>Open-source programs are not only free to use and copy; they're also free to modify however you wish. Perhaps the best-known open-source program is the Linux operating system, which rivals the features of Microsoft Windows but with better reliability and security. Since anyone can modify an open-source program, many companies offer slightly different versions of Linux, known as Linux <span class="emphasis"><em>distributions</em></span>. You can either buy a Linux distribution or download a copy for free off the Internet. Some popular Linux distributions include Red Hat Software (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.redhat.com">www.redhat.com</a>), Mandriva Linux (<a class="ulink" href="http://wwwnew.mandriva.com/en/community">wwwnew.mandriva.com/en/community</a>), Debian (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org">www.debian.org</a>), Ubuntu Linux (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">www.ubuntulinux.org</a>), and SUSE Linux (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensuse.org">www.opensuse.org</a>).

Cheapbytes just sells the discs, without the fancy retail box or any manuals, but you'll save up to 90 percent off retail while still getting the latest Linux distribution.</p><p>For true computer renegades, skip both Microsoft Windows and Linux and go for a pure Unix environment in the form of FreeBSD (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.freebsd.org">www.freebsd.org</a>) or OpenBSD (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openbsd.org">www.openbsd.org</a>). Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD are more suitable for people unafraid of digging into the guts of their operating system and typing cryptic commands.

</span></span></div></div><p>Like most criminals, hackers often bring about their own downfall by failing to remove all traces of their crime. Not only do many hackers leave incriminating notes and printouts of their latest exploits scattered around, but they also can't resist bragging about their exploits in public chat rooms. Yet even this blatant indiscretion wouldn't be so damaging if these same hackers didn't unwittingly leave incriminating evidence stored all over their own computers too.</p><div class="sect1" title="Recovering Deleted Data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="recovering_deleted_data"/>Recovering Deleted Data</h1></div></div></div><p>The biggest difference between electronic data and traditional data is that once you store electronic data on any form of magnetic media, it can stay there much longer than you expect. To understand how it's possible to recover a file that's been deleted, you need to understand how computers store and organize files on a disk.</p><p>When a computer stores information on a disk, it can't just toss it anywhere, because that would make it difficult to find it again—it would be like throwing your socks on your bedroom floor and then wondering why you can never find a matching pair when you need one. To help organize data, computers divide disks into multiple <span class="emphasis"><em>tracks</em></span>, which you can think of as circular storage bins on the surface of a disk.</p><p>Each track is divided into smaller parts called <span class="emphasis"><em>sectors</em></span>. A group of sectors is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>cluster</em></span>. When you save data to your disk, your computer stores your file in multiple sectors. When you add or delete data from a file, the total number of sectors used to store your file grows or shrinks accordingly. Basically, a sector is a tiny box that contains part of a single file.</p><p>Ideally, your computer tries to store files as one continuous track, which allows it to retrieve data quickly. However, the more you save, edit, and delete files, the more likely it is that the computer will have to store one part of a file in one sector and another part of that same file in another sector, on a completely different part of the disk. When you defragment your hard disk, you're essentially rearranging all your files so the data from each file gets stored in adjacent sectors once more.</p><p>To keep track of which sectors contain which files, every disk contains a special directory, sometimes called a File Allocation Table (FAT) or a Master File Table (MFT). The FAT or MFT (or whatever name your particular computer uses) lists all the files stored on the disk along with pointers that identify the exact tracks and sectors that contain each file.</p><p>When you delete a file, your computer takes a shortcut. Instead of physically destroying the data, the computer simply erases its existence from the disk's directory, which pretends that the file no longer exists, although the contents of the file are still intact. Only when the computer needs the space taken up by the deleted file will it actually overwrite the old information with new data. This is like taking your name off your apartment building's directory when you move out, but leaving your unwanted belongings behind in your old apartment. Only when someone else moves in do the old contents of the apartment get thrown out.</p><p>If your disk has plenty of extra space available, you could go weeks, months, or even years before the data in those deleted sectors is overwritten. (You can accomplish almost the same thing as overwriting the data, however, by defragmenting your hard drive regularly.)</p><p>You can usually retrieve a trashed file by running an undelete utility program right away. An undelete utility simply changes the disk directory to identify any "deleted" files, so that the computer will recognize the files again. Of course, the longer you wait to run the utility, the more likely your computer will have overwritten some, or possibly all, of a particular deleted file's contents with new data, making it difficult, if not impossible, to recover the original contents.</p><p>Some utility programs, such as the Norton Utilities, come with a file-deletion protection feature that saves any deleted files in a special folder so that you can quickly and accurately recover them any time in the future. Obviously, this feature can be a lifesaver if you accidentally delete something important, but it can also work against you by preserving sensitive files you thought you got rid of months ago.</p><p>To find an undelete program, try Norton Utilities (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.symantec.com">www.symantec.com</a>), Active@DELETE (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.active-undelete.com">www.active-undelete.com</a>), Restorer 2000 (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bitmart.net">www.bitmart.net</a>), or Undelete (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.execsoft.com">www.execsoft.com</a>). Executive Software, the maker of Undelete, also offers a free Deleted File Analysis Utility (see <a class="xref" href="ch22.html#the_deleted_file_analysis_utility_from_e" title="Figure 22-1. The Deleted File Analysis Utility from Executive Software can reveal all the files you deleted in the past that someone may still be able to recover and read.">Figure 22-1</a>), which examines your hard disk to see how many deleted files may still be recoverable.

<div class="sect1" title="File Shredders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="file_shredders"/>File Shredders</h1></div></div></div><p>If you delete a file, wait a day or two, and then try to run an undelete program, there's a good chance that the operating system will have overwritten all or part of that file's contents.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you want to intentionally overwrite old data belonging to deleted files, you can use a special file-shredding program. File shredders overwrite the storage formerly used by deleted files with random characters, one or more times. As a result, even if an undelete program manages to recover the old disk directory entry pointing to a previously deleted file, it will only find random data stored there.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Not all file shredders are equal, however. For example, to defeat an ordinary undelete program and get the job done more quickly, a file shredder may make just one pass at filling your deleted file's old data area with random data. While this quick wipeout defeats most undelete programs, it will not defeat specialized computer forensics tools. A really good file shredder offers several ways to shred your files that balance speed and security, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch22s02.html#a_file_shredder_can_offer_you_different" title="Figure 22-2. A file shredder can offer you different ways to shred your files, giving you a choice between speed and security.">Figure 22-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_file_shredder_can_offer_you_different"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e15159"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676761.png.jpg" alt="A file shredder can offer you different ways to shred your files, giving you a choice between speed and security."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-2. A file shredder can offer you different ways to shred your files, giving you a choice between speed and security.</p></div><p>Most file shredders make multiple passes over a deleted file for additional security; the more passes, the longer the deletion takes, but the more likely you'll eliminate all hope of recovery.</p><p>The Department of Defense (DoD) even has its own shredding standard, dubbed DoD 5220.22-M (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm">www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm</a>), which defines acceptable government standards for deleting computer files. The DoD technique wipes a file seven times, each pass replacing the deleted data with a different set of random data that further obscures the original. Seven passes can destroy virtually all traces of the original file, although theoretically it may be possible to recover some or all of the information later using a magnetic sensor or electron microscope to scan the storage media on an atomic scale.</p><p>The Gutmann algorithm is even safer than the DoD data deletion standard, requiring 35 passes over a file's disk storage areas to wipe away every possible trace of the original contents. For more information about securely destroying data, visit Peter Gutmann's web page (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001">www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001</a>) and read his paper, "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory."<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0012" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0013" class="indexterm"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Storing Deleted Data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="storing_deleted_data"/>Storing Deleted Data</h1></div></div></div><p>No matter how many times you've deleted a file or what deletion methods you may have used, there will almost always be a way to retrieve it again. The most direct approach is to recover bits and pieces of an overwritten file's data by analyzing its magnetic traces on the hard disk, as mentioned above. A more practical and much simpler approach is to look for undeleted traces of that file scattered in other places on the computer.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you're trying to get rid of data, simply encrypting or deleting a file will never be enough. Encryption and file deletion hide a specific file's contents, but do nothing to hide or erase information copied from the file into temporary files on your hard disk. For example, Microsoft Word typically creates a temporary copy of your document as an emergency backup, just in case your computer crashes or the power goes out. Then you can recover your work by loading this temporary file. However, if you create a sensitive document and encrypt it, all of your sensitive data still remains inside Word's emergency backup copy of your file, which anyone can open and read.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding data stored in slack space"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_data_stored_in_slack_space"/>Finding data stored in slack space</h2></div></div></div><p>Under Microsoft Windows, the computer divides magnetic media (hard disks, floppy disks, rewritable CDs, etc.) into chunks of a fixed size known as clusters. When you store a file, the entire file rarely fits in a single cluster, so Windows stores it in multiple clusters. Almost inevitably, the last part of a file won't completely fill up its cluster, and it's this extra space that's known as <span class="emphasis"><em>slack space</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0014" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Computers often use the slack space to store information about that particular file. For example, when you open a file (say, for editing) and type anything from the key-board, the operating system may temporarily store your keystrokes in a portion of memory called the keyboard buffer. Without the keyboard buffer, you could type too fast for the computer to react, and it could lose keystrokes. When you close the file, the computer may then clear the keyboard buffer by dumping its contents into that file's slack space.</p><p>If you delete parts of a file, that file's slack space grows and traces of the previous file version are left behind there. If you delete or encrypt a file, the slack space remains untouched because it is not actually part of the file. Until you overwrite the slack space with random data, any information dumped there can still be recovered.</p><p>For maximum security, don't just encrypt your files but encrypt your entire hard disk. Not only will this protect your files, but it will also encrypt any traces of your data scattered elsewhere on your computer.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding data stored in swap files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="finding_data_stored_in_swap_files"/>Finding data stored in swap files</h2></div></div></div><p>One particularly vulnerable area of your computer is the swap file. A <span class="emphasis"><em>swap file</em></span> allocates part of your hard disk for temporarily storing data from its working memory, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>random-access memory (RAM)</em></span>, so that the computer can free up some of this space to use for running programs as needed. Without swap files, your computer would have to store both a running program and any open files it is using in RAM. So, if you opened an extremely large file, that could be enough to gobble up all of your memory and prevent other programs from running. By selectively swapping data back and forth between the hard disk and the RAM, an operating system can run more than one program at a time, even if their total memory requirement theoretically exceeds what's actually available. (This trick used by the computer to manage running programs is where the name "swap file" comes from.)<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So, when you run a program such as a word processor or a spreadsheet, your operating system from time to time temporarily stores some of the associated data, such as the contents of a report or a budget that you're working on, in the swap file—typically when the program is momentarily idle. When you save or delete the data file, much of the file's data may still remain in the swap file.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Your history stored in a web browser cache"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="your_history_stored_in_a_web_browser_cac"/>Your history stored in a web browser cache</h2></div></div></div><p>When you search the Internet, your browser stores (or <span class="emphasis"><em>caches</em></span>) the graphic images from the pages you visit in what's called the <span class="emphasis"><em>cache directory</em></span>. That way, if you visit the same website later, your computer can retrieve these graphics from its cache rather than directly off the Internet, which can speed up the time it takes the page to load.</p><p>By browsing the cache directory of someone's browser, you can see which websites they've visited along with the graphic images they saw, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch22s03.html#viewing_the_contents_of_a_browser_apostr" title="Figure 22-3. Viewing the contents of a browser's cache reveals the websites and graphic images recently viewed.">Figure 22-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_the_contents_of_a_browser_apostr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e15247"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676763.png.jpg" alt="Viewing the contents of a browser's cache reveals the websites and graphic images recently viewed."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-3. Viewing the contents of a browser's cache reveals the websites and graphic images recently viewed.</p></div><p>To view the cache for Internet Explorer, grab a copy of BCIView (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.debryansk.ru/~kamkov">www.debryansk.ru/~kamkov</a>) or Cache Auditor (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.webknacks.com">www.webknacks.com</a>).

That's exactly what computer forensics experts are counting on when they examine a suspect's computer.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0023" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Hackers can also take advantage of computer forensics by sneaking into a computer and looking for previously deleted files containing firewall or security program logs that can identify what type of firewall or security program is running and possibly how it might work. If you're a system administrator, just remember that your computer's log files might be hidden or encrypted, but there's always a way for a hacker to use computer forensics to find it anyway.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Computer Forensics Tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="computer_forensics_tools"/>Computer Forensics Tools</h1></div></div></div><p>Depending on the seriousness of the crime and the importance of recovering the data stored on a disk, computer forensics experts generally rely on four basic tools when retrieving deleted data: file-undeleting programs, hex editors, and magnetic sensors and electron microscopes.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-22-0025" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="File-undeleting programs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="file-undeleting_programs"/>File-undeleting programs</h2></div></div></div><p>As discussed earlier in this chapter, file-undeleting programs, readily available with programs like Norton Utilities, are often sufficient to catch novices who attempt to get rid of incriminating files, such as pictures of child pornography. But they are only effective if the file contents have not already been overwritten on your hard disk, so undeleting programs are a relatively weak forensics tool.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Hex editors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hex_editors"/>Hex editors</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Hex editors</em></span> are special programs that let you peek at the physical contents stored on a disk. Programmers often use hex editors to modify or examine files, while hackers often use hex editors to peek inside copy-protected games so they can peel away the security or so they can modify the video game to find and turn on hidden features.</p><p>Hex editors can probe the contents of any disk. Instead of forcing you to view a disk's contents as organized into partitions, directories, and files, as usually shown to the user by an operating system, a hex editor lets you examine the contents of a disk in terms of its physical layout, such as scanning the surface of the storage media from the outer edges of the disk down to its inner edges.</p><p>By using a hex editor, computer forensic specialists can identify and retrieve information that can't normally be accessed by the operating system. As shown in <a class="xref" href="ch22s04.html#a_hex_editor_can_display_the_hidden_cont" title="Figure 22-4. A hex editor can display the hidden contents of any disk sector or file.">Figure 22-4</a>, hex editors don't rely on operating system services to open and access "files." Instead, they display the physical disk area holding the contents of a file, using hexadecimal codes to represent the actual bytes of data.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0026" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_hex_editor_can_display_the_hidden_cont"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_d1e15351"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676765.png.jpg" alt="A hex editor can display the hidden contents of any disk sector or file."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 22-4. A hex editor can display the hidden contents of any disk sector or file.</p></div><p>Using a hex editor to examine an entire hard disk would be like scouring the inside of a skyscraper for fingerprints, so they're best used for searching only the specific parts of a drive where desired information may reside. Still, hex editors can often recover some or all of the data from a deleted file that you might not otherwise be able to access, such as in the slack space of a file. To see what a hex editor can find on your hard disk, download and try Hex Workshop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bpsoft.com">www.bpsoft.com</a>), UltraEdit (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.idmcomp.com">www.idmcomp.com</a>), WinHex (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.x-ways.net">www.x-ways.net</a>), or VEDIT (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.vedit.com">www.vedit.com</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Magnetic sensors and electron microscopes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="magnetic_sensors_and_electron_microscope"/>Magnetic sensors and electron microscopes</h2></div></div></div><p>No matter how many times you overwrite a file or format and partition a hard disk, traces of the original data may still remain. File shredders make it progressively more expensive and difficult to retrieve, but not impossible.</p><p>Every file you delete leaves residual magnetic traces of itself. Each time the computer overwrites a file's contents, the disk heads may be aligned slightly differently with respect to the surface of the media, and fragments of the deleted file may remain afterwards. Forensics experts can use sensors to measure the changes in magnetic fields on a disk's surface and then reconstruct part or all of the bytes in a deleted file, or they can use an electron microscope to do the same thing. Electron microscopes—extremely expensive but available to many governmental organizations—can also measure tiny changes in magnetic fields, left over from the original data, that not even overwriting can completely obliterate.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0027" class="indexterm"/></p><p>People may burn their floppy or hard disks, crush and mangle them, cut them into pieces, pour acid on them, and physically manhandle them in a myriad of ways, thinking there will be no possible way of using them on another computer again. However, even the physical destruction of a floppy or hard disk can't guarantee that the data has been safely destroyed, because government agencies such as the FBI and CIA are able to practice a specialized technique known as disk splicing. Disk splicing entails physically rearranging the pieces of a floppy or hard disk as nearly as possible back to its original condition. Then magnetic sensors or electron microscopes scan for traces of information still stored on the disk surface.<a id="IDX-CHP-22-0028" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Obviously, disk splicing is a time-consuming and expensive procedure, so don't expect your local police force to have that kind of knowledge, skill, or equipment. But if you've destroyed evidence that might interest the NSA, CIA, or FBI, don't expect a mangled disk to hide your secrets from the prying electronic eyes of rich and powerful government agencies. In fact, the American government even has a special laboratory called The Defense Computer Forensics Lab (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dcfl.gov">www.dcfl.gov</a>), located in Linthicum, Maryland, which specializes in retrieving information from computers, no matter what condition of the hardware or disks.</p><p>The ultimate lesson to learn is that if you don't want to risk having information retrieved off your hard or floppy disk, your only absolutely foolproof option is to avoid storing it on any computer in the first place.</p></div></div>

Many people sell used computers without bothering to wipe out their personal data, which means there's a good chance you could still find someone else's financial records, personal information, and even credit card numbers, too. If you're going to give away a computer, make sure you wipe the hard disk as clean as possible, and then hope that someone won't get lucky and find some useful information still hidden on your erased hard disk anyway.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Protecting Yourself"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="protecting_yourself-id2"/>Protecting Yourself</h1></div></div></div><p>Even if you shred files religiously, law enforcement officials, and possibly others, have a variety of computer forensics tools at their disposal to pry out any secrets your deleted files may be hiding. So how can you protect your computer from their prying eyes? Basically, you can't. While you can make recovering data harder by periodically purging your cache directory and only storing files on removable disks (such as rewritable DVDs) and physically destroying them afterwards, just remember that everything you do on your computer can potentially be recovered and examined later.</p><p>To destroy the contents of a hard disk quickly, grab a copy of DiskZapper (<a class="ulink" href="http://diskzapper.com">http://diskzapper.com</a>), available as a bootable floppy or CD. If you boot up from a DiskZapper disk, the program starts erasing your hard disk right away. It can be a handy tool to have around when you want to destroy data quickly.</p><p>If you're a programmer and want to understand exactly how a file shredder works, download the source code for Eraser (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tolvanen.com/eraser">www.tolvanen.com/eraser</a>), written by Sami Tolvanen. Not only is this file shredder absolutely free for anyone to use, but it is also distributed with Microsoft Visual C++ source code, so you can see how it works and even customize it for your own particular needs.</p><p>Linux users can download a file-deleting program called Wipe (<a class="ulink" href="http://gsu.linux.org.tr/wipe">http://gsu.linux.org.tr/wipe</a>). Like Eraser, Wipe is free and includes C source code so you can look under the hood and maybe even improve the program on your own to wipe out data even more securely.</p><p>But don't assume you can rest easy even if you've gone ahead and scoured your hard disk until it's squeaky clean. Just as every bullet fired can potentially be traced to a specific gun, so everything created by a computer can be traced to a specific machine given the right circumstances and a determined enough searcher.</p><p>Edward Delp (<a class="ulink" href="http://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/~ace">http://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/~ace</a>), a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, has developed a technique to identify the unique "signatures" of printers based on their subtle variations. The United States Secret Service is particularly interested in this technology for tracing documents and counterfeit bills back to specific printers.</p><p>Tadayoshi Kohno, a University of California Ph.D. student, has even found a way to identify individual computers over the Internet, as documented in the research paper "Remote physical device fingerprinting" (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.caida.org/outreach/papers/2005/fingerprinting">www.caida.org/outreach/papers/2005/fingerprinting</a>). The technique works by "exploiting small, microscopic deviations in device hardware: clock skews." Essentially, Kohno's technique analyzes how a particular computer's clock timestamps the information it sends over the Internet, which can be used to uniquely identify that specific computer even if it's behind a firewall or connecting to the Internet through multiple proxy servers.</p><p>So, if your hard disk data can be retrieved despite your best attempts to destroy it, and if your printer and your computer hardware can give away your activities, can you ever keep any of your stuff private? The answer is no—unless, of course, you only use someone else's computer. Will you ever really need to go this far? That answer depends on you.</p></div>

</span></span></div></div><p>Perhaps the best way to protect a computer from physical theft is to keep it in a locked room, bolted firmly in one place.</p><p>Most laptops have a security slot that can hold a cable, but desktop models often require a special plate that attaches with glue to the side of the computer, monitor, or desk. Security cables, like bicycle locks, can deter novices and slow down opportunistic thieves, but they can't stop a determined thief. Given enough time, ordinary nail polish remover can dissolve the adhesives used to glue the cable attachments to the computer, and laptop security locks can be broken with a few well-placed blows of a hammer. More impatient thieves may just snap the restraining cable in half with a pair of wire cutters.</p><p>Before you fall victim to theft, make sure you record your computer's model number, make, and serial number in a safe place. Then, if someone does steal it, you can enter the information into the Stolen Computer Registry (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.stolencomputers.org">www.stolencomputers.org</a>), a free service that maintains a database of pilfered items. As the site explains, "Buyers, resellers, insurers, law enforcement, and security professionals check suspicious computers against this list. When stolen equipment is located, the Registry supplies information and assists in recovery and return of property to the rightful owners."<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For additional protection, use an etching pen to scratch your driver's license number or other identification on the inside of the computer case (where thieves won't likely find it) or on the outside (to reduce the resale value of the equipment because the thieves must remove that identification before they can unload it).</p><div class="sect1" title="Protecting Your Computer (and Its Parts)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="protecting_your_computer_open_parenthesi"/>Protecting Your Computer (and Its Parts)</h1></div></div></div><p>Sometimes stealing an entire computer is too obvious or difficult, but taking the components inside presents less of a challenge. After all, anyone can see when a computer suddenly disappears from a desk, but who will notice when a computer suddenly loses a hard drive (along with all the data stored on it)?</p><p>To prevent someone from opening up your computer, buy a protective cover, which is a metal case that fits over the ordinary computer case and locks it to a desk or table. Such protective metal cases not only deter thieves from stealing the computer, but also from opening it to get at anything inside.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0005" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although many people worry about outside hackers breaking into their computers and wiping out their data, the truth is that many hacker attacks come from people who already have legitimate access, such as coworkers, consultants, or technicians. To guard against these folks, buy protective disk drive locks, which cover the front of the drive and stop anyone from inserting a floppy or CD/DVD carrying a virus or Trojan horse. Of course, you should probably check with the IT department before you start locking down your work computer, which your employer owns.</p><p>To learn more about physical security devices, such as cables, locks, and protective covers, you can browse the merchandise from CompuCage (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.compucage.com">www.compucage.com</a>), Computer Security Products (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.computersecurity.com">www.computersecurity.com</a>), FMJ/Pad.Lock (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fmjpadlock.com">www.fmjpadlock.com</a>), Kensington (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kensington.com">www.kensington.com</a>), PC Guardian (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pcguardian.com">www.pcguardian.com</a>), or Secure-It (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.secure-it.com">www.secure-it.com</a>).</p><div class="sect2" title="USB blockers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="usb_blockers"/>USB blockers</h2></div></div></div><p>Many companies now sell USB drives that act like a portable hard drive for carrying data or programs with you wherever you go. People use them for swapping data between computers at work and home, but thieves can use those same USB drives to steal and transport information.</p><p>While Windows Vista can block USB drives, other versions of Windows cannot. To prevent anyone from plugging a USB drive into your computer and copying your data, use a program such as Sanctuary Device Control (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.securewave.com">www.securewave.com</a>), USB Port Protector (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.portprotector.com">www.portprotector.com</a>), or DeviceWall (<a class="ulink" href="http://devicewall.centennial-software.com">http://devicewall.centennial-software.com</a>). With one of these tools installed, your computer won't recognize an unauthorized USB drive and thieves won't be able to copy any data off your computer using one, even if they have physical access to your computer.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Alarms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="alarms"/>Alarms</h2></div></div></div><p>An alarm can act as a deterrent because the last thing a thief wants is anything that draws attention to his activity. Many companies make motion detection alarms that plug into a computer's ordinary expansion slot and run off their own power so they can work whether the computer is on or off. When the alarm detects abnormal motion that suggests someone is moving the computer, the alarm lets out a high-pitched wail.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0006" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Barracuda Security Devices (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.barracudasecurity.com">www.barracudasecurity.com</a>) sells another motion detector that arms itself when it senses changes in internal ambient light, indicating that the case has been opened. If a valid PIN isn't entered, the device sounds an ear-piercing alarm and dials a pager or digital cell phone number to alert the user of the theft attempt. An optional exploding dye capsule will also spray ink all over the computer (and the thief), making the parts easy to identify (and harder to sell).</p><p>Laptop computers are even more vulnerable to theft. Laptop alarms, such as those sold by Trust (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.trust.com">www.trust.com</a>), consist of two parts: a sensor attached to the laptop and another one carried by the user (attached to a keychain or kept in a pocket). The moment your laptop gets separated from you by a fixed distance (such as 15 feet), an alarm goes off. If this doesn't cause the thief to drop the laptop right away, you can follow the piercing whine and, hopefully, retrieve it yourself.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-23-0008" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If the thief does get away with your laptop, the motion detection alarm can password-protect and encrypt your hard disk, essentially preventing him from copying any data.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Remote tracking services"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="remote_tracking_services"/>Remote tracking services</h2></div></div></div><p>Another protective mechanism is a tracing or monitoring program that buries itself on your laptop's hard drive. Every time you connect to the Internet, the tracking program contacts a special server and sends the IP address of the laptop's current location. If you report your laptop stolen, the server waits for your laptop to contact it again and update its new location. Then, the tracking-software company contacts the authorities to help track down the missing computer.</p><p>For this the tracking program to work, you must make sure you configure your firewall to allow the tracking program to access the Internet. Otherwise your own firewall could defeat the tracking program and wind up helping out a thief.</p><p>For added security, the server can also command the remote tracking software to encrypt your hard disk to prevent the thief from accessing your data.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For more information about various remote tracking programs available for laptop computers, visit Advatrack (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.absolute-protect.com">www.absolute-protect.com</a>), CompuTrace (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.computrace.com">www.computrace.com</a>), CyberAngel (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sentryinc.com">www.sentryinc.com</a>), or zTrace (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ztrace.com">www.ztrace.com</a>).</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Protecting Your Data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="protecting_your_data"/>Protecting Your Data</h1></div></div></div><p>Locks, alarms, and tracking services are utterly powerless against viruses, worms, or accidents. So, after physically protecting your computer, take time to protect the data stored on it too.</p><div class="sect2" title="Backing up your data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="backing_up_your_data"/>Backing up your data</h2></div></div></div><p>If your hard disk crashes, your office catches on fire, or a thief steals your computer, you'll want a second copy of the valuable data you no longer have access to. Perhaps the simplest way to back up your data regularly is with an external hard disk, which typically plugs into a USB port. Just run a program such as Retrospect Backup (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dantz.com">www.dantz.com</a>) and schedule it to copy your files to your external hard disk automatically.</p><p>Of course, if a fire, flood, or other accident wipes out your entire home or office, chances are good you'll lose data stored on an external hard disk too. For more security, store your data offline with a subscription service, such as @Backup (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.backup.com">www.backup.com</a>), which copies your data to the company's computers. Now, if anything happens to your machine, you can conveniently retrieve all your data from @Backup via the Internet.</p><p>Streamload (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.streamload.com">www.streamload.com</a>) offers 25GB of storage for free, which makes it another option for copying your files securely to an off-site server. Unlimited storage costs extra and varies by subscription plan, and there are limits on how much data that you, or other authorized users, can download from your account each month.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Update and patch your operating system"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="update_and_patch_your_operating_system"/>Update and patch your operating system</h2></div></div></div><p>The most secure operating system available is OpenBSD (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openbsd.org">www.openbsd.org</a>), but unless you're willing to switch to it, your best choice is to keep your current operating system updated with the latest security patches. (Keep in mind that no operating system is completely secure and that, sometimes, installing a security patch will actually make your computer less secure, due to bugs in the patch itself.)<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-23-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The latest version of Microsoft Windows can download and install updates automatically, but you should also keep abreast of the latest news about operating system flaws and holes that hackers might exploit.

Patches and updates eliminate most flaws but do nothing to close ports that have been deliberately left open for valid purposes. For example, the default installation of Windows 2000/XP opens a port to run the Windows Messenger Service, which was originally designed to let network administrators send messages to users. However, this open port also provides a doorway straight into your computer for less welcome visitors.</p><p>To take advantage of this gaping hole, many unethical vendors scan ranges of IP addresses to find Windows 2000/XP computers with the Messenger Service port left open. Then they send pop-up ads through this open port advertising anti–pop-up software that will prevent additional pop-up ads from coming through this very same hole, essentially using extortion to convince you to buy their product.</p><p>Rather than waste your money on anti–pop-up ad programs, you can just turn off the Messenger Service for free.</p><p>To turn off Messenger Service in Windows 2000, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Click the Start button, choose Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Before you even consider going online, you absolutely must get a firewall. Different firewalls have different features, but you can only use one firewall at a time, so it's important to choose one that provides the most protection while requiring minimal configuration by you.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>What distinguishes a good firewall from a poor one is the firewall's technical capabilities, along with its default settings. Just because you've installed a firewall doesn't mean you're protected against all types of attacks.

So if you want to keep your Macintosh secure, stop using Safari (which most hackers will attack because it's used by default on every Macintosh computer), and start using an alternate browser such as Firefox, Opera, or Camino (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.caminobrowser.org">www.caminobrowser.org</a>). Just remember that every program has flaws that can be exploited. As alternate browsers like Firefox become more popular, expect hackers to start exploiting Firefox flaws as often as they target Internet Explorer flaws.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0016" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If your browser doesn't offer a cache-cleaning feature, try a separate (and free) program such as CoffeeCup Privacy Cleaner (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.coffeecup.com">www.coffeecup.com</a>) or Crap Cleaner (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ccleaner.com">www.ccleaner.com</a>)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Protecting your email account from spam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="protecting_your_email_account_from_spam"/>Protecting your email account from spam</h2></div></div></div><p>Most Internet service providers (ISPs) now offer free antivirus scanning and spam filtering, but you'll want to make sure you turn those features on. (If your ISP doesn't offer these services, consider switching to a different vendor.) No matter how wonderful your ISP may claim its spam filters are, chances are they still won't be enough, so consider using a separate spam filter as well.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0017" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For a free spam-filtering program, try CoffeeCup Spam Blocker (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.coffeecup.com">www.coffeecup.com</a>) or Ella for Spam Control (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openfieldsoftware.com">www.openfieldsoftware.com</a>). Both can block spam that your ISPs filters might miss.</p><p>Even then, spam is still likely to slip past, so make sure you turn on the spam-filtering features of your email client too. Microsoft Outlook comes with a spam filter, but many worms know how to exploit Outlook to email copies of themselves to everyone in your address book. Instead, consider switching to the free Thunderbird email program (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird">www.mozilla.com/thunderbird</a>), developed by the same people who brought you the Firefox browser. Not only can Thunderbird foil mass-emailing worms, it can also filter out spam at the same time. By running spam through your ISP's spam filter, a separate spam filter, and finally your email program's spam filter, even though you still won't eliminate all unwanted mail, you'll reduce the flood to a mere trickle.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Protecting against phishing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="protecting_against_phishing"/>Protecting against phishing</h2></div></div></div><p>Phishing occurs when online con artists use unsolicited email (spam) to direct victims to a bogus website masquerading as a legitimate one (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. The Internet Con Artists">Chapter 13</a>). As soon as a phishing victim types her credit card number, password, or bank account number on the website accessed by clicking a link in the email, the thief can gain access to the victim's personal accounts and money.<a id="IDX-CHP-23-0018" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To foil phishing attempts, never trust unsolicited email from any bank or credit card company. (If you still can't determine whether an email is legitimate or not, call the bank or credit card company directly and ask them to verify the message's authenticity.)</p><p>For additional help identifying phishing attacks, download a copy of SpoofGuard (<a class="ulink" href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/SpoofGuard">http://crypto.stanford.edu/SpoofGuard</a>) for Internet Explorer. SpoofGuard examines a website's address and uses a variety of criteria, such as unusual letters or numbers mixed into the website address, to assess a site's validity, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch23s02.html#spoofguard_uses_different_criteria_to_id" title="Figure 23-5. SpoofGuard uses different criteria to identify bogus websites.">Figure 23-5</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="spoofguard_uses_different_criteria_to_id"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_d1e15915"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages676775.png.jpg" alt="SpoofGuard uses different criteria to identify bogus websites."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 23-5. SpoofGuard uses different criteria to identify bogus websites.</p></div><p>For another way to identify bogus websites, download the Earthlink ToolBar (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.earthlink.net/software/free/toolbar">www.earthlink.net/software/free/toolbar</a>) or the Netcraft Toolbar (<a class="ulink" href="http://toolbar.netcraft.com">http://toolbar.netcraft.com</a>). Both compare website addresses against a list of known phisher sites, warning you when it finds a match.</p><p>Because phishers create new bogus sites all the time, both the Earthlink and Netcraft toolbars allow users to submit addresses to a central database, which helps keep it up-to-date and comprehensive.</p><p>Other sites that offer anti-phishing tools are PhishGuard (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.phishguard.com">www.phishguard.com</a>), SiteAdvisor (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.siteadvisor.com">www.siteadvisor.com</a>), and PhishFighting (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.phishfighting.com">www.phishfighting.com</a>). Both programs rely on user contributions to stay effective. When someone finds a phishing website, she can forward the URL address to everyone else using the program to warn them about the bogus site, proving the old theory that there's safety in numbers.</p></div></div>

<div class="appendix" title="Appendix&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Epilogue"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="epilogue"/>Appendix A. Epilogue</h1></div></div></div><p>Hacking applies to more than just computers. Hacking is the practice of thinking beyond boundaries to see what lies on the other side. There is nothing inherently good or bad about hacking. It just is.</p><p>You can hack a computer, a locked door, an abandoned building, or even another person. If you're the type who's constantly learning, experimenting, and testing the world around you, you're a hacker, and you may not even know it.</p><p>Hackers appear under many different names and disguises. They've been called computer experts, phone phreakers, crackers, white/black hat hackers, social engineers, urban explorers, con artists, stalkers, liars, activists, terrorists, hate groups, spammers, troublemakers, thieves, and criminals. But in reality, hackers should also be called police officers, reporters, broadcasters, scientists, students, teachers, writers, philosophers, accountants, lawyers, judges, salespeople, chauvinists, feminists, engineers, doctors, and politicians. Everyone's a hacker and everyone knows someone who's a hacker whether they realize it or not.</p><p>Hackers are adept at managing information in any form, whether it's stored as a computer program, a written word, a physical object (such as a lock), a set of procedures, or thoughts inside somebody's head. Hacking is never a computer issue; it's always a people issue.</p><p>If you get nothing else from this book, please remember this: You are being hacked every day of your life—far beyond the simple threats of computer viruses or identity theft. Advertisers (on billboards and in TV commercials, magazine ads, and the notorious spam and spyware) are trying to rearrange your thinking. Politicians and governments have already shaped your thoughts with the "history" that's taught in schools, the "news" they disseminate, and the "laws" they pass to restrict your actions. In truth, history is nothing but a set of beliefs, news is nothing but a point of view, and laws are nothing but tools to legitimize the government's behavior.</p><p>The real threat doesn't come from faceless hordes of hackers intent on making your life miserable. The real threat comes from faceless hordes of criminals intent on making your life miserable, whether they're part of a ring of identity thieves in Eastern Europe, a bored teenager in Southern California stealing credit card numbers in Internet chat rooms, organized crime syndicates breaking into banks electronically, public relations firms planting phony stories in "reputable" newspapers and magazines, politicians holding press conferences that provide nothing but empty generalities, or religious leaders saying that the only way to get into heaven is by following their instructions.</p><p>The real threat will never come from any single, identifiable group of people. The real threat will always come from any individual motivated by dishonesty and greed.</p><p>Ultimately, hacking teaches you that nobody has your best interests at heart except you. Anyone who tells you otherwise is nothing but a hacker.</p></div>
