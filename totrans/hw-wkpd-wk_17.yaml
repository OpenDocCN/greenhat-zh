    they are resolved. That Wikipedia works, considering its open-door policy for
    editors, is not a minor miracle. Wikipedia has to cope with pettiness and strange
    behavior, as well as predictable amounts of editing by people with agendas and
    those bored children whose immediate reaction to a freely editable encyclopedia
    is to scribble on it. Because of Wikipedia's success in compiling a large, free,
    open encyclopedia, some might be surprised that the site also experiences various
    kinds of serious internal strife. Disputes on Wikipedia cannot be wished away
    ("Can't we all just get along?"). Allowing anyone to edit just about anything
    has a price.

    An *edit war* is a content dispute in which two or more editors have decided to
    try to impose their view on an article by repeatedly changing the article to a
    version in line with their opinion. This conflict over content is the most common
    kind and typically takes the form of a *revert war*, with editors going back and
    forth about what to include. Other content disputes, such as disputed merges and
    title issues, also arise, and these are handled by the mechanisms mentioned in
    [Chapter 8](hw-wkpd-wk_10.html "Chapter 8. Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web"). Edit
    wars are common in contentious topic areas, which is no coincidence. But they
    are otherwise rare, as most articles contain nothing to provoke heated arguments,
    and if you stay away from editing contentious topics, you may never encounter
    one.

    consensus prevails in most articles, the majority of which are not disputed. A
    few topics are in rapid flux, but most topic areas are at least temporarily settled
    because most of the interested editors consider the content good enough. Because
    of this, a sensible solution to a dispute can sometimes be restoring a disputed

    any major change, particularly to a contentious topic—explain the change and your

    source material to substantiate claims. For example, which comic books belong
    in the Batman canon (if such a thing exists) can never really be determined. And
    sectarian strife in the heavy metal world has fired up many fans who might otherwise
    have never contributed to Wikipedia. While some of these matters could be handled
    by insisting on a neutral point of view, it can be difficult to get fans who are
    passionate about their point of view to agree.

    For instance, in late 2006, an arbitration case opened on Wikipedia concerning
    [[Derek Smart]], the article about the game author known for *Battlecruiser 3000AD*
    and other videogames. ^([[30](#ftn.CHP-14-FNOTE-1)]) An intractable controversy
    that was already long established in other Internet forums about Smart's games
    migrated to Wikipedia. In these circumstances, influencing the editors involved
    is almost impossible as they will have mostly made up their mind on the issue
    and will treat others who disagree in an adversarial fashion.

    and nationalist conflicts in our world. This situation has a certain inevitability
    about it. Wikipedia's policies, particularly No Original Research (WP:NOR), mean
    that Wikipedia articles should only create a record of the conflicts, not pass
    judgment on them in any way. Partisans may well want to take control of Wikipedia's
    articles. But the fundamental exclusions of non-neutral editing and original research,
    like the drawing of historical conclusions ahead of the historians, should block
    their ambitions. Because the world has no shortage of those who would like to
    use Wikipedia as a propaganda place, Wikipedia can only do a limited amount by
    identifying and banning problem editors in these areas. Real-world conflicts can
    be very contentious; edit any topic that you know to be generally controversial
    carefully.

    that strives to be neutral and fair toward all points of view without cultural
    bias? Even disputes with a small locus can have wide implications. A particularly
    salient example is one that arose during the early days of the site concerning
    nomenclature for the Polish city of Gdańsk, formerly known as Danzig. To explain
    the issue, Danzig is an *exonym* (placename in another language, in this case
    German) and is the historically accurate name for the city during certain periods.

    have changed is to use the "P in Q (now R in S)" style. For example, writing "New
    Amsterdam in New Netherland (now New York City, USA)" is helpful to the general
    reader and appropriate for an article dealing with the first half of the 17th
    century when the future city of New York was a Dutch settlement. This is an example
    of an English exonym: Nieuw Amsterdam and Nieuw-Nederland were the Dutch names.'

    20th century. Real-world tensions arising from nationalist and ethnic feeling
    cannot be discounted in Wikipedia. On the other hand, the project's aim is to
    compile a useful reference work. Therefore, editors should use *historical exonyms*
    to aid reader comprehension wherever possible. The common usage in standard textbooks
    and scholarly works is at least relevant.

- en: Another example is that of Burma, which renamed itself Myanmar in 1989; the
    Wikipedia article was under the title *Myanmar* and searches for *Burma* redirected
    to the Myanmar article. This reflected the usage in many typical English-language
    news organizations, but in late 2007 a different view prevailed on the site after
    greater media coverage, and now Burma is used. For Côte d'Ivoire, the official
    name as of 1985, you'll find greater uncertainty since news organizations sometimes
    use Ivory Coast, the older English name that has not diedut. At one point this
    caused a dispute. In this case Wikipedia's basic policy of using the most common
    English name is tempered by the wish to be reasonably correct, though not pedantic
    (République de Côte d'Ivoire would be more correct, but encyclopedias don't need
    to use this full title). In the case of Mumbai, formerly Bombay, the name changed
    officially in 1995 and has been adopted on Wikipedia. In reporting on current
    affairs, therefore, the trend in English has been to drop exonyms, but not always.
    The general acceptance of present-day changes, however, doesn't address the proper
    conventions for historical exonyms.

    now in Poland, but which were in Germany before 1945, dogged the English-language
    Wikipedia almost from the outset. Danzig had a particular and unusual status as
    a free city between 1918 and 1939\. Given its complex history before that, rival
    proposals arose for a naming convention. Over a period of years, a dispute over
    the article title festered, and no consensus was reached. As is usual in such
    situations, editors tended to try to establish "facts on the ground" rather than
    to engage in patient discussions. The dispute was long-running and contentious,

    for example, in policing various conduct paroles imposed by the Arbitration Committee

    from an IP number). The editor can also email people through his or her user page.
    If you receive a short block, use these privileges to communicate wisely. Blocks
    are not generally given without warning; several standardized series of user talk
    page templates exist (at [[Wikipedia:Template message/User talk namespace]]) to
    warn against inappropriate behavior. These are supposed to be placed before a
    block is issued by those monitoring vandalism.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Longer blocks and permanent bans are not Wikipedia's first line of defense but
    may be imposed due to destructive or disruptive behavior. A month-long block might
    be applied in the case of a returning vandal, for example, an account or IP number
    with an accumulated history of malicious edits. Blocks are not punitive (a misconception)
    but implemented to protect the project.

- en: For blocks longer than a few days, the blocked editor may want to request a
    review. The procedure is explained at [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block]] (shortcut
    WP:APB). A blocked editor initiates the review by placing the template `{{unblock|`*`give
    reason here}}`* at the bottom of his or her user talk page. This will trigger
    a review by a different administrator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ahead of an appeal, the blocked editor should think through his or her position.
    The difference between edit warring as disruptive behavior and as an attempt to
    straighten out what an article says may depend on who is considering the issue.
    The blocked editor should try to separate out policy matters, for example, on
    reverting and civility, from content matters.

- en: Bans are more serious than blocks because they signify that a formal decision
    has been made to exclude an editor from the site. A ban may be for period of time,
    or it may be indefinite. Wikipedia has two kinds of bans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A ban handed down by the Arbitration Committee is for a time period of at most
    one year. A *community ban* means an indefinite block has been imposed such that
    no other administrator is willing to lift it based on the facts of the case. Community
    bans are typically blocks that occur after a series of other blocks have been
    made that have not been successfully appealed by the editor in question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ultimate appeal against either kind of ban may be made to the Arbitration
    Committee. Making an immediate appeal to the ArbCom is not usually worthwhile,
    however; the banned editor and the blocking administrator should discuss the ban
    first to clarify the issue. The Arbitration Committee judges cases by considering
    the facts in addition to the editor's previous contributions to the site. An editor
    with few meaningful contributions to articles is unlikely to be successful in
    appealing a community ban.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a block is imposed to enforce a ban after an arbitration ruling, trying to
    get the blocking administrator to lift it is pointless. The ban can in this case
    be reviewed by the Arbitration Committee.

- en: This chapter should make it clear that most disputes are settled in informal
    ways. That's how it should be. Good editors are only on the site because they
    think Wikipedia's project is important and worthwhile. Disputes should not take
    up too much time, and proportion and perspective are needed to keep them from
    doing so. The few formal dispute resolution mechanisms should be entered into
    with good faith and reserved for only the most intractable arguments. If you have
    a quarrel with another editor, take a resourceful approach to sorting out your
    mutual difficulties—this will probably pay off in terms of time saved.
