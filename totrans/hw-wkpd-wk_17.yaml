    they are resolved. That Wikipedia works, considering its open-door policy for
    editors, is not a minor miracle. Wikipedia has to cope with pettiness and strange
    behavior, as well as predictable amounts of editing by people with agendas and
    those bored children whose immediate reaction to a freely editable encyclopedia
    is to scribble on it. Because of Wikipedia's success in compiling a large, free,
    open encyclopedia, some might be surprised that the site also experiences various
    kinds of serious internal strife. Disputes on Wikipedia cannot be wished away
    ("Can't we all just get along?"). Allowing anyone to edit just about anything
    has a price.

    An *edit war* is a content dispute in which two or more editors have decided to
    try to impose their view on an article by repeatedly changing the article to a
    version in line with their opinion. This conflict over content is the most common
    kind and typically takes the form of a *revert war*, with editors going back and
    forth about what to include. Other content disputes, such as disputed merges and
    title issues, also arise, and these are handled by the mechanisms mentioned in
    [Chapter 8](hw-wkpd-wk_10.html "Chapter 8. Make and Mend Wikipedia's Web"). Edit
    wars are common in contentious topic areas, which is no coincidence. But they
    are otherwise rare, as most articles contain nothing to provoke heated arguments,
    and if you stay away from editing contentious topics, you may never encounter
    one.

    the *community* for any particular article consists of those people who take an

    at any point. Generally, consensus occurs through everyday editing of an article,
    with any disputed points or disagreements discussed on the talk page. In dispute
    resolution, consensus does not mean everyone *agrees* with the outcome; instead,
    it means everyone agrees to abide by it.

    to a particular editor's actions or you want to make sure he or she sees your
    comment, leave a quick note on that editor's talk page, alerting him or her to
    the new discussion; though in general, if you wish to discuss an article's content,
    you should keep the conversation close to the article itself. As noted in [Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html
    "Chapter 5. Basic Editing"), if you have made a change that others may find controversial—or
    any major change, particularly to a contentious topic—explain the change and your

    Consensus regarding content should, therefore, be based on broadminded, fair discussion

    greater media coverage, and now Burma is used. For Côte d'Ivoire, the official
    name as of 1985, you'll find greater uncertainty since news organizations sometimes
    use Ivory Coast, the older English name that has not diedut. At one point this
    caused a dispute. In this case Wikipedia's basic policy of using the most common
    English name is tempered by the wish to be reasonably correct, though not pedantic
    (République de Côte d'Ivoire would be more correct, but encyclopedias don't need
    to use this full title). In the case of Mumbai, formerly Bombay, the name changed

  zh: 短期屏蔽表示编辑正在违反网站政策。第一次违规通常最多被屏蔽24小时。对于第一次违规，屏蔽不会是全面的，因此编辑仍然可以编辑他的或她的用户讨论页面（即使是从IP地址编辑）。编辑还可以通过他的或她的用户页面给人们发邮件。如果您收到短期屏蔽，请明智地使用这些特权。通常不会在没有警告的情况下给予屏蔽；存在几个标准化的用户讨论页面模板系列（在[[Wikipedia:Template
    message/User talk namespace]]），用于警告不当行为。这些应该在那些监控破坏行为的人发布屏蔽之前放置。
- en: The reason for a block is entered into the block log by the administrator issuing
    the block, when setting the block period. Block logs accumulate information over
    time. To inspect block logs, either for accounts or for IP numbers, go to [[Special:Log/block]]
    and fill in the form with the account name you are interested in. You can check
    for IP numbers whether or not you are editing from that IP yourself. For example,
    most vandalism on Wikipedia arises from the use of shared school computers. School
    IT staff can use the logs to monitor problem editing from their machines and find
    out who to contact on Wikipedia in case editing is blocked.

    closed to troublesome contributors. Editing rights are a privilege, not an entitlement.
    Blocked editors can still read the site while a *time out* has been imposed on
    their editing. They can, for example, research in depth for future additions to
    an article of interest. Perhaps that's expecting too much, but if you're blocked
    for a day or so, you can make a favorable impression by returning to work with
    something to offer the project.

    reason here}}`* at the bottom of his or her user talk page. This will trigger
    a review by a different administrator.

    The difference between edit warring as disruptive behavior and as an attempt to

    Committee. Making an immediate appeal to the ArbCom is not usually worthwhile,
    however; the banned editor and the blocking administrator should discuss the ban
    first to clarify the issue. The Arbitration Committee judges cases by considering
    the facts in addition to the editor's previous contributions to the site. An editor
    with few meaningful contributions to articles is unlikely to be successful in
    appealing a community ban.

  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter should make it clear that most disputes are settled in informal
    ways. That's how it should be. Good editors are only on the site because they
    think Wikipedia's project is important and worthwhile. Disputes should not take
    up too much time, and proportion and perspective are needed to keep them from
    doing so. The few formal dispute resolution mechanisms should be entered into
    with good faith and reserved for only the most intractable arguments. If you have
    a quarrel with another editor, take a resourceful approach to sorting out your
    mutual difficulties—this will probably pay off in terms of time saved.

  zh: 本章应清楚地表明，大多数争议都是通过非正式方式解决的。这正是应该如此。优秀的编辑之所以留在网站上，是因为他们认为维基百科的项目重要且值得。争议不应占用太多时间，需要比例和视角来防止它们占用太多时间。少数正式的争议解决机制应本着良好的意愿，仅用于最难以解决的争论。如果您与其他编辑有争执，采取富有成效的方法来解决你们的共同困难——这可能会在节省时间方面得到回报。
