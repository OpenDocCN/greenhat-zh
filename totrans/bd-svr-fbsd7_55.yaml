- en: Postfix is an open source mail transfer agent (MTA). An MTA is used for routing
    and delivering email on the Internet. Postfix was originally developed as an alternative
    to the widely deployed Sendmail MTA. Like Sendmail, Postfix operates using SMTP.
    An emphasis on security was placed on its development in response to Sendmail's
    history of security-related problems.

- en: Postfix supports SASL and TLS for secure connections, as well as the Maildir
    mailbox format (adopted from the Qmail MTA). Postfix is the default MTA for several
    Linux distributions, NetBSD, and the latest incarnations of Apple's Mac OS X.

- en: Wietse Venema, a computer security specialist and IBM researcher, wrote Postfix
    in 1998\. IBM released Venema's software (then named IBM Secure Mailer) as open
    source, in hopes that it would become widely adopted to create a faster and more
    secure email infrastructure. This release helped IBM develop its open source strategy,
    which was gaining popularity at the time.
