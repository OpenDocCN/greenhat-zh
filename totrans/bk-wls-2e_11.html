Wi-Fi signals in schools, libraries, airports, coffee shops, and conference centers, aboard trains and buses, and even in city parks and highway rest areas go a long way toward making your laptop computer or other portable a go-anywhere Internet appliance. In many urban areas, it seems as if there are Wi-Fi networks almost everywhere. When you open your computer's wireless network setup program in a city center or a residential neighborhood, it often detects half a dozen or more Wi-Fi signals. Depending on your location, many of these signals are likely to be business office LANs or home networks, but many others are public networks that welcome connections from outside users (that's you). Some of these services charge by the hour (or by the month) for Internet access, but many others are free.</p><p>This chapter explains how to find Wi-Fi access points that will allow you to connect and how to choose the best access point when your computer detects more than one nearby network.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="public_wi-fi_is_not_secure"/>Public Wi-Fi Is Not Secure</h1></div></div></div><p>Any time you use a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1129"/>public Wi-Fi hot spot, there is a very real possibility that somebody else is reading everything that moves to and from your computer, including your login names and passwords, email, instant messages, and personal <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1130"/>information on web pages. Wi-Fi network monitor programs that can capture and display Wi-Fi data packets as they move through the air are easy to find and use.

More likely, it's a victim of the ad hoc network bug described later in this chapter. If your computer identifies a nearby network as a free Wi-Fi site, you should not trust it. Don't bother connecting to open ad hoc networks without the "Free Wifi" name—they won't let you get online anyway.

Among other things, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1164"/>NetStumbler displays numeric values for the signal strength and noise level of each network, rather than just a set of bars.

If you don't already have an account with a particular wireless service provider, most of them allow new users to set up new accounts on the spot.</p><div class="sect3" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="airports_and_conference_centers"/>Airports and Conference Centers</h3></div></div></div><p>Providing public wireless network service to airport terminals is a new and growing industry that appears to be simple from the consumer's point of view—just install enough access points to cover all the concourses and the airlines' lounges, connect them to a broadband Internet trunk, and wait for customers to start paying for network access. It sounds like a license to print money. Of course, it's not that simple. Nothing that involves a government-owned airport authority and a facility that supports dozens of different radio services for everything from air traffic control to rental car returns and shuttle buses is ever easy. Things get even more complicated when the airport signs a franchise agreement with one wireless service and every airline contracts with a different company to provide wireless service to all of their VIP clubs.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1174"/></p><p>It seems as if the management of every airport has come up with a slightly different set of answers to these questions. Therefore, you can't assume that the account you set up to connect in the Admirals' Club in Chicago will also work at the waiting area near gate A-14 in Seattle. The only way you can find out is to fire up the computer and see what signals it detects. If the Wi-Fi utility tells you that it has found a signal, remember to look at the menu or window that shows the names of all the networks within range. If you have an account with one of those networks, go ahead and log in. If not, choose the network with the best signal quality and set up a new account. To avoid falling into a theft-of-data trap, be sure to avoid connecting to any signals that your computer identifies as ad hoc networks.</p><p>If you travel through the same airports a lot, or if you belong to one or more of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1175"/>airlines' VIP clubs, you will want to set up a prepaid account with the company that provides service to those locations. When you find yourself in an airport (or any other location) that uses a different service, you can sign up for a pay-as-you-go account on the spot.</p><p>Wi-Fi service in conference centers is similar. You might need a paid subscription to one of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1176"/>public Wi-Fi services, but more and more conference organizers provide free Wi-Fi connections. To connect, turn on your laptop or other wireless device and look for a strong signal.

Wireless access to the Internet has become almost as common as a television in each room and free morning coffee. Some properties include Wi-Fi service as a standard amenity at no extra charge, while many others require guests to pay extra <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1177"/>for Internet use.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1178"/></p><p>To avoid an unpleasant surprise on your bill, it's always a good idea to ask about Wi-Fi charges when you check into a hotel. Some places might automatically add an inflated charge for network access unless you specifically refuse it, even if you connect to their network for just a few minutes. Like wildly expensive long-distance telephone calls, some innkeepers treat Internet access as one more potential opportunity to gouge their guests.</p><p>If you're staying at a hotel or motel that charges an unreasonable amount for Wi-Fi (more than about $10 per day), tell the desk clerk that you will not be using the service, so they should not charge you for it. Take your laptop computer to a nearby coffee shop, café, public library, or some other nearby hot spot where you can connect at a lower cost, or even better, for free. Or if you travel a lot, consider using a broadband wireless data service like the ones described in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. ALTERNATIVES TO WI-FI: WIRELESS BROADBAND DATA">Chapter 13</a> to completely bypass the hotel's Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Many networks in hotels and other businesses will ask you to provide a login and password before they allow you to connect to the Internet, even if they don't charge for the service, to restrict access to their own customers.

The idea of use-it-anywhere Wi-Fi, both for laptops and other portables, and as an alternative to cable and DSL connections, seems like a logical new type of public utility, just like electricity and the public water supply. Therefore, many towns and cities around the world are looking at either building their own wide-area Wi-Fi networks or contracting with a private service provider.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1183"/></p><p>Public Wi-Fi hasn't worked out as well as many vendors and local governments had hoped and expected, especially in major urban centers. The trade magazines and websites that keep track of such things are full of reports that one city after another has either delayed the start-up of their <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1184"/>municipal Wi-Fi networks or had the private networking company that was building the system for them fail to deliver the service on schedule or even cancel their contracts. The initial gold rush mentality that seems to drive entrepreneurs toward any new technology has been replaced by a wait-and-see position: Until somebody figures out how to actually make money on a citywide system, the vendors are hesitant to move forward.</p><p>It turns out that community Wi-Fi networks have several possible problems. Signals from outdoor antennas don't always provide reliable signals inside houses and commercial buildings without additional hardware; many people who already subscribe to wired DSL or cable Internet services don't want to pay for another subscription that duplicates what they already have; and some of the new broadband wireless data services, such as the ones we'll describe in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. ALTERNATIVES TO WI-FI: WIRELESS BROADBAND DATA">Chapter 13</a>, don't require nearly as many individual access points, so they're far less costly to build and maintain. Without a base of new subscribers, the network suppliers don't want to spend money on the network infrastructure.</p><p>In spite of these initial difficulties, a few towns and cities are already offering municipal Wi-Fi services, and others will follow. If you live or work in a place where a public Wi-Fi network is on the air, it can be a convenient alternative to the ones you've been using in coffee shops, bookstores, and other locations as a supplement to your own home and office networks.</p><p>After 2009, when many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1185"/>broadcast television stations in the United States move to different channels (2011 in Canada), even more wireless data options will probably appear. Eventually, some kind of wide-area wireless Internet service will probably become available in many cities and towns around the world. Whether that service uses Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or some other technology remains to be seen.</p><p>Like most other paid Wi-Fi networks, most <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1186"/>municipal networks display a login and password entry window after you connect. In a few cases, the network provides some small amount of access time at no cost so you can send and receive email or conduct a brief instant messaging session before the payment meter begins to run.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="free_public_wifi"/>"Free Public WiFi"</h1></div></div></div><p>There's an odd Wi-Fi nuisance that claims to be a network called <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Public WiFi</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Internet Access</em></span> or some similar name, which is caused by a bug in many Wi-Fi control programs (including the one in Windows). Everybody loves something free, so it's very tempting to click on that network and try to connect, especially when the alternative service charges by the hour or by the day. Connecting to one of these networks probably won't damage your computer or destroy any data, but they're false signals that you should know about and avoid. These signals are particularly common at airports, hotels, and other locations where a lot of people are using their laptops at the same time within a relatively small area.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1187"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1188"/></p><p>If a Wi-Fi control program has one or more ad hoc networks in its list of preferred networks, it sends out a beacon signal whenever it searches for a connection, and every other nearby Wi-Fi adapter receives and displays the name of that network (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Wi-Fi Service</em></span>). When the owner of one of <span class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> computers tries to connect to the "free" network, the control program adds the name to its preferred list, and it sends out yet another beacon signal. And so it goes, quietly creating more useless new beacon signals all the time. In a busy airport waiting area, you might see half a dozen or more separate <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Wi-Fi</em></span> ad hoc network listings in your Wi-Fi control program.</p><p>The original <span class="emphasis"><em>Free Wi-Fi</em></span> signal was probably a network cracker who wanted to steal passwords and other data from unsuspecting travelers. However, the bug in the Wi-Fi control programs that causes it to reproduce itself has created a wireless worm that is more of a nuisance than a serious security threat.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch11s06.html#the_three_computer-to-computer_networks_" title="Figure 11-7. The three computer-to-computer networks in this screen are not what they appear to be.">Figure 11-7</a> shows a Windows Wireless Network Connection program that has detected three separate bogus ad hoc networks.

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="unprotected_private_access_points"/>Unprotected Private Access Points</h1></div></div></div><p>There's one more source of accessible Wi-Fi signals that we haven't discussed until now: the ones that leak from wireless home and office networks that your neighbors haven't bothered to protect. It can be awfully tempting to grab a connection to one of those networks, but it's both illegal and unethical, even if it is amazingly easy. In many downtown office districts, high-tech industrial parks, and residential neighborhoods, a casual visitor can often find and log in to half a dozen or more wireless networks within a few blocks.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1197"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1198"/></p><p>If you can detect a network signal, you might be able to connect through that network to the Internet, but this is legally considered "<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1199"/>theft of service"; network managers and law enforcement people frown on it, to say the least.</p><p>Of course, nobody with the good sense to read this book would ever consider using somebody else's network or eavesdropping on somebody else's wireless traffic without permission. If you want to try, you're on your own. A few minutes online with a good web search engine can supply a list of factory default SSIDs and WEP codes for many popular network access points and software for cracking WEP encryption. Many users, especially in home networks and small businesses, don't turn on encryption because it's "too complicated" or "too much trouble" or because nobody told them that it's important (consider yourself advised: It's important). Many more never bother to change their default IDs and passwords.</p><p>This kind of wireless network hacking is sometimes described as <span class="emphasis"><em>wardriving</em></span>, as an extension of the older hackers' practice of wardialing—using a modem to dial random telephone numbers in search of computers with <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1200"/>unprotected dial-in ports.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1201"/></p><p>Some unprotected wireless networks actually welcome public access, so there's a legitimate reason for wardriving (or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1202"/>warwalking with a Wi-Fi enabled PDA or smartphone). Even if you don't actually try to set up a connection to a network, it can be instructive (and yes, entertaining) to wander around to see what's out there, but when you click that Connect button on your neighbor's network without permission, you're breaking the law.</p><p>In general, wardriving, or <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-11-1203"/>guerilla networking, or whatever you want to call it, is one of those activities, like monitoring your neighbors' cordless telephone conversations, that are sort of fun but not within the limits of polite conduct. Yeah, you can argue that anybody who's dumb enough to operate an unprotected wireless network deserves to have other people use it, or that the bandwidth is right out there for the taking, but that's not likely to convince the owner of the network (or the nice policeman who comes knocking on your car door while you're online) that your intentions are entirely honorable and that you're not doing anybody any harm.</p><p>If you treat wardriving as a nonintrusive hobby, like those people who take their radio scanners to a railroad freight yard and listen to conversations between train dispatchers and individual locomotive engineers, or bird-watchers who keep a book that lists every species they've ever seen, then it's probably quite harmless. But when you cross the line and actually establish an unauthorized connection, you should understand exactly what you're doing—stealing bandwidth.</p><p>It's not common, but police have actually arrested people for stealing a Wi-Fi connection. In 2006, the owner of a Vancouver, Washington coffee shop complained about a man who had used her Wi-Fi hot spot from his parked truck several times a week for three months without ever buying anything. The cops charged him with theft of services. A year later, the BBC reported that another man in the English town of Redditch, Worcestershire was cautioned for "dishonestly obtaining communications services with intent to avoid payment." And yet another person was fined £500 in London for "hijacking a wireless broadband connection."</p><p>And even if the Network Police don't come and arrest you for theft of service (which is possible but highly unlikely), you're also risking your own data; some unprotected networks are operated by people who hope you will use them because they're logging all your keystrokes and other data, including your email password, credit card numbers, and other personal information.</p><p>Of course, when you're on the other side of this fence, it's in your interest to prevent unauthorized users from connecting through your access point. At the very least, you should understand that Wi-Fi networks are not absolutely secure, and every access point and network adapter radiates signals that can be detected by outsiders. You can take steps to restrict access to your network, but you can't keep the existence of the network a secret from a serious snoop. As manager of your own wireless network, this should raise a whole lot of questions in your mind. Questions like: Is my network secure? Can somebody on the street connect to my network without my knowledge? How do I keep those #*@&amp;$! out of my network? For the answers to these and other questions about wireless network security, go immediately to the next chapter of this book.</p></div></body></html>
