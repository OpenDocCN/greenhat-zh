    to varying degrees. I don’t mean just desktop backgrounds and colors and display
    fonts but things like window borders too. You can even change the entire desktop

    the Unity environment in Ubuntu is that it is not as easily customizable as others.
    The main way to give yourself total customization freedom is to actually get rid
    of Unity, which is delving into pretty geeky territory, but there are some things
    you can do without getting all that drastic. So, let’s just start off by discussing
    the easy tweaks you can do and then gradually work our way into a bit of minor
    geekdom for those of you who want to get down and a little (just a little) dirty.

    and making the sensitivity rather high, because getting the Launcher to pop out
    of hiding can take some getting used to; the process just doesn’t have the same
    smooth feel as you might be used to in Windows or Mac. You kind of have to whack

- en: Starting where MyUnity leaves off, CompizConfig Settings Manager, also known
    as CCSM ([Figure 9-18](ch09.html#compizconfig_settings_manager "Figure 9-18. CompizConfig
    Settings Manager")), allows you to tweak more system elements and to configure
    effects. Compiz is the compositing engine at work in Ubuntu that provides it with
    its 3D effects, such as shadows and window animations. Its job is to bring together
    all the various elements at work in your system that create the graphical environment
    and then, in conjunction with your 3D–compatible video card, make everything seem
    to be working as one graphical unit. You might say it is the eye-candy engine
    for your system, and as such it is a busy bit of software indeed! CCSM is the
    graphical interface by which you can control Compiz’s features.

- en: Compiz is automatically enabled at startup only if you have a graphics card
    that supports its basic set of features. An easy way to tell whether Compiz has
    kicked in on your machine is to open any window (your Home folder, for example)
    and check to see whether that window has a drop shadow. If it does not, then Compiz
    is not at work, and this section will not be of much use to you—skip to the next
    section. If it does have a shadow, however, Compiz is at work, so keep on reading.

- en: The graphical effects that are active by default in your system are really the
    tip of the iceberg. Depending on the capabilities of your graphics card, you will
    get the drop shadows and a few other bells and whistles, such as cooler window-opening
    transitions, but that’s about it—on the surface, at any rate. If you like, you
    can get a feel for it right now by kicking the effects up a notch. First run CCSM
    by going to the Dash, clicking the Applications lens, and then clicking the **Customization**
    filter button and looking for it in the results shown. Or if you prefer, just
    type **`compiz`** in the Dash and press enter.

- en: The very first thing you will see, along with the CCSM window, will be another
    window warning you that CCSM is an advanced tool and that you should proceed with
    caution. The warning is right, so if you’re not sure what something in CCSM is
    or does, then perhaps you shouldn’t fool with it. You should be safe trying out
    the things I mention here, however, starting out with *Wobbly Windows*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To give Wobbly Windows a try (and thus get a hands-on feel for CCSM), click
    the **Effects** button on the left side of the CCSM window and then in the next
    screen check **Wobbly Windows**. In the screen after that, check the box next
    to the words **Enable Wobbly Windows**. In the small window that then appears,
    click the **Disable Snapping Windows** button. Now drag the -window around. As
    you will see, the whole thing will start wiggling like jelly when you move it—freaky
    and totally distracting, but kind of cool. You can uncheck the Wobbly Windows
    box if the feature is getting on your nerves.

    "Figure 9-19. The Compiz Annotate tool allows you to write on the screen.")).
    To activate the Annotate tool, click the **Extras** button in the left side of
    the screen, and then check the box next to **Annotate** in the new screen. Click
    the word **Annotate** itself to get to the preferences for that tool (this is
    the same way you access preferences for all tools and features), as shown in [Figure 9-20](ch09.html#almost_every_compiz_feature_and_tool_has

    thereby learn how to activate the tool’s features.
