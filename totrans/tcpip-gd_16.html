Over the past few decades, as the global TCP/IP Internet has grown, hundreds of new applications have been created. These programs support a myriad of different tasks and functions, ranging from implementing essential business tasks to providing pure entertainment. Users may be in the same room or on different continents.</p><p>Of the many TCP/IP applications, a small number are widely considered to be key applications of TCP/IP. Most have been around for a very long time—in some cases, longer than even the modern Internet Protocol (IP) itself. Many of these protocols deal specifically with the sending of information that has been arranged into discrete units called <span class="emphasis"><em>files</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span>. For this reason, one of the most important groups of TCP/IP applications is the one that describes the basic mechanisms for moving these files between internetworked devices: <span class="emphasis"><em>file and message transfer applications</em></span>.</p><p>The rest of this book deals with the most common definitive TCP/IP applications and application layer protocols. Before describing the applications themselves, however, I need to lay some groundwork related to application protocols as a whole. To that end, this part contains two chapters. In the first, I explain the universal system set up for TCP/IP applications to use for addressing Internet resources: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs). In the second chapter, I provide an overview of file and message transfer applications, including a description of the differences between them.</p></div></div>
<div class="chapter" title="Chapter&#xA0;70.&#xA0;TCP/IP APPLICATION LAYER ADDRESSING: UNIFORM RESOURCE IDENTIFIERS, LOCATORS, AND NAMES (URIS, URLS, AND URNS)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tcp_ip_application_layer_addressing_unif"/>Chapter 70. TCP/IP APPLICATION LAYER ADDRESSING: UNIFORM RESOURCE IDENTIFIERS, LOCATORS, AND NAMES (URIS, URLS, AND URNS)</h1></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e74733"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages287681.png.jpg"/></div></div><p> The Internet consists of millions of interconnected servers, each of which is capable of providing useful information to Internet users who request it. The more information a network has, the richer it is, but the more difficult it becomes to locate. In order to use information, we need to be able to find it, and that requires, at a minimum, that we employ some means for labeling each file or object.</p><p>For this purpose, TCP/IP has defined a system of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that can be used both on the Internet and on private TCP/IP networks. Each URI uniquely specifies how a client can locate a particular resource and access it so it can be used. URIs are subdivided into Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs), which serve a similar purpose but work in different ways.</p><p>In this chapter, I describe the system of addressing used on the Internet to identify files, objects, and resources. I begin with an overview, which introduces the concept of URIs and explains the differences between URIs, URLs, and URNs. I then provide a detailed explanation of URLs and how they are used. This includes an overview of the general syntax used for URLs, a description of the URL schemes used for the most common applications, a discussion of relative URLs and how they work, and a comprehensive look at real-world issues associated with URLs, including the intentional obfuscation games being played by some unscrupulous people. Finally, I discuss URNs, including how they solve a major problem with URLs and the impediments to their use.</p><div class="sect1" title="URI Overview and Standards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="uri_overview_and_standards"/>URI Overview and Standards</h1></div></div></div><p>If you've been working your way up the OSI Reference Model layers in reading this book, you might have expected that you would be done with addressing by this point. After all, we have already discussed MAC addresses at layer 2, IP addresses at layer 3, and mechanisms for converting between them (see Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. ADDRESS RESOLUTION AND THE TCP/IP ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (ARP)">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. REVERSE ADDRESS RESOLUTION AND THE TCP/IP REVERSE ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (RARP)">Chapter 14</a>). We even have ports and sockets that provide transport layer addressing capabilities to let each device run multiple software applications (see <a class="xref" href="ch43.html" title="Chapter 43. TCP AND UDP ADDRESSING: PORTS AND SOCKETS">Chapter 43</a>). Given all this, the idea of application layer addressing may seem a bit strange, and I am aware that using the term to refer to the subject of this chapter may be a bit unorthodox.</p><p>The concept isn't really as odd as it might seem at first, however. It's true that with an IP address and a port number, we can theoretically access any resource on a TCP/IP internetwork; the problem is finding it.</p><p>Application layer addressing is not something that is required by the computer software. It is something that makes it easier for humans to identify and locate resources. This is very much the same rationale that is used to justify the creation of name systems, such as the Domain Name System (DNS; see <a class="xref" href="pt12.html" title="Part III-1. NAME SYSTEMS AND TCP/IP NAME REGISTRATION AND NAME RESOLUTION">Part III-1</a>). DNS is a form of high-level addressing that allows names to be used instead of IP addresses. It is helpful to people, who find it easier to understand www.intel.com than 198.175.96.33.</p><p>The idea behind a comprehensive application layer addressing scheme is to extend to the next level what DNS has already accomplished. DNS names provide essential high-level abstract addressing, but only of whole devices (whether real or virtual). These names can be used as the basis for a more complete labeling scheme that points not just to a site or device, but to a specific file, object, or other resource. In TCP/IP, these labels are called Uniform Resource Identifiers (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2466"/>URIs).</p><p>URIs were one of the key technologies developed as part of the World Wide Web (WWW), and they are still most often associated with the Web and the protocol that implements it, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP; see <a class="xref" href="pt19.html" title="Part III-8. TCP/IP WORLD WIDE WEB AND THE HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (HTTP)">Part III-8</a>). You have likely used URIs thousands of times in the past; whenever you enter something like <code class="literal">http://www.myfavoritewebsite.com</code> into a web browser, you are using a URI.</p><p>The reason why URIs are so important to the Web is that they combine into one string all of the information necessary to refer to a resource. This compactness of expression is essential to the entire concept of hypertext resource linking. If we want to be able to have an object in one document point to another, we need to have a simple way of describing that object without requiring a whole set of instructions. URIs allow us to do exactly that.</p><p>In fact, URIs are so associated with the Web that they are usually described as being part of Web technology specifically. They are not, however, unique to the Web, which is why this chapter is separate from the discussion of WWW and HTTP.</p><div class="sect2" title="URI Categories: URLs and URNs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="uri_categories_urls_and_urns"/>URI Categories: URLs and URNs</h2></div></div></div><p>URIs are a general-purpose method for referring to many kinds of TCP/IP resources. They are currently divided into two primary <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2467"/>categories based on how they describe a resource:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)</strong></span> A URL is a URI that refers to a resource through the combination of a protocol or access mechanism and a specific resource location. A URL begins with the name of the protocol to be used for accessing the resource, and then contains sufficient information to point to how it can be obtained.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Uniform Resource Names (URNs)</strong></span> A URN is a URI that provides a way of uniquely naming a resource without specifying an access protocol or mechanism, and without specifying a particular location.</p><p>The difference between a URL and a URN is that the former is much more specific and oriented around how to access a resource, while the latter is more abstract and designed more to identify what the resource is than describe how to get it.</p><p>Giving someone a URL is like giving them directions to find a book, as follows: "Take the train to Albuquerque, then Bus #11 to 41 Albert Street, a red brick house owned by Joanne Johnson. The book you want is the third from the right on the bottom of the bookshelf on the second floor."</p><p>A URN is more like referring to a book using its International Standard Book Number (ISBN); it uniquely identifies the book, regardless of where the book may be located, and doesn't tell you how to access it. (In fact, ISBNs are one of the identification systems used with URNs, as you will see in the section about URNs at the end of this chapter.)</p><p>While URLs and URNs are theoretical peers, in practice, URLs are used far more often than URNs. In fact, URLs are so dominant that most people have never even heard of URIs or URNs. The reason is that even though the example of how to find a book suggests that URNs are more natural than URLs, URLs are easier to use in practice. URLs provide the information needed to access a resource, and without being able to access a resource, simply knowing how to identify it is of limited value.</p><p>URNs are an attractive concept because they identify a resource without tying it to a specific access mechanism or location. However, the implementation of URNs requires some means of tying the permanent identifier of a resource to where it is at any given moment, which is not a simple task. For this reason, URNs and the methods for using them have been in development for a number of years, while URLs have been in active use all that time.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-412"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Some sort of mechanism is needed on any internetwork to allow resources such as files, directories, and programs to be identified and accessed. In TCP/IP, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used for this sort of "application layer addressing." The two types of URIs are Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which specify how to access an object using a combination of an access method and location, and Uniform Resource Names (URNs), which identify an object by name but do not indicate how to access it.</p></div><p>While URLs began with the Web and most URLs are still used with HTTP, they can and do refer to resources that are accessed using many other protocols, such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Telnet. The compactness of URIs makes them very powerful for such uses. With a URL, we can use one string to tell a program to retrieve a file using FTP. This replaces the complete FTP process of starting an FTP client, establishing a session, logging in, and issuing commands.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="URI Standards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="uri_standards"/>URI Standards</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2468"/>A number of Internet standards published in the 1990s describe the syntax and basic use of URIs, URLs, and URNs. The first was RFC 1630, "Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW," which was published in 1994 and is still a good overview of the topic. In December 1994, a pair of documents, RFCs 1737 and 1738, provided more specific information about URNs and URLs, respectively. RFC 1808 describes how to define and use relative URLs. RFC 2141 provides more information about the URN syntax.</p><p>RFC 2396, "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax," was published in August 1998 to revise and replace some of the information in many of the previous RFCs just mentioned. It is probably the definitive standard on URIs at the present time, although RFCs continue to be published discussing issues related to URIs. This is especially true of URNs, which as I noted earlier, are still in active development.</p><p>The base documents such as RFC 2396 describe how URLs can be specified for a number of common protocols (called <span class="emphasis"><em>schemes</em></span> in URL-speak, as we will see when we look at URLs more closely). To provide flexibility, a mechanism was also defined to allow new URL schemes to be registered. This is described in RFC 2717, "Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names," and RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes." There are also a few RFCs that describe specific URL schemes for different protocols, including RFCs 2192 (IMAP), 2224 (NFS), 2368 (email), and 2384 (POP).</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="URL General Syntax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="url_general_syntax"/>URL General Syntax</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2469"/>URLs are text strings that allow a resource such as a file or other object to be labeled based on its location on an internetwork and the primary method or protocol by which it may be accessed. URLs have become the most common type of URI used for application layer addressing in TCP/IP because of their simplicity.</p><p>URLs consist of two components that identify how to access a resource on a TCP/IP internetwork: the location of the resource and the method to be used to access it. These two pieces of information, taken together, allow a user with the appropriate software to obtain, read, or otherwise work with many different kinds of resources, such as files, objects, programs, and much more.</p><p>The most general form of syntax for a URL contains only two elements, which correspond to the two pieces of information just described: <code class="literal">&lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;</code>. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>scheme</em></span> refers to a type of access method, which describes the way that the resource is to be used. It usually refers to either an application protocol, such as <code class="literal">http</code> or <code class="literal">ftp</code>, or a resource type, such as <code class="literal">file</code>. A scheme name must contain only letters, plus signs (+), periods (.), and hyphens (-). In practice, scheme names usually contain only letters. Schemes are case-insensitive but usually expressed in lowercase.</p><p>The rest of the URL after the scheme (and the required colon separator) is scheme-specific. This is necessary because various protocols and access methods require different types and quantities of information to identify a particular resource. When a URL is read, the scheme name tells the program parsing it how to interpret the syntax of the rest of the URL.</p><div class="sect2" title="Common Internet Scheme Syntax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="common_internet_scheme_syntax"/>Common Internet Scheme Syntax</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2470"/>In theory, each scheme may use a completely different syntax for the <code class="literal">&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;</code> of a URL. However, many of these schemes share a common syntax for this part, by virtue of the similarities in how they refer to internetwork devices and resources on those devices. For example, both HTTP and FTP are used to point to specific TCP/IP devices using a DNS name or IP address, and then access resources stored in a hierarchical directory structure. It makes sense that their URLs would be at least somewhat similar.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-413"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> URLs are the most widely used type of URI. In its most basic form, a URL consists of two elements: a scheme that defines the protocol or other mechanism for accessing the resource, and a scheme-specific part that contains information that identifies the specific resource and indicates how it should be used. Some schemes use a common syntax for their scheme-specific parts; others use a syntax unique to the scheme.</p></div><p>The most general form of this <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2471"/>common Internet scheme syntax is as follows:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e74885"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;url-path&gt;;&lt;params&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;</pre><p>The syntax elements are as follows:</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;scheme&gt;</code></strong> The URL scheme, which refers to a type of access method.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;user&gt;</code></strong> <span class="strong"><strong>and</strong></span> <strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;password&gt;</code></strong> Authentication information for schemes requiring a login, in the form of a user name and password.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;host&gt;</code></strong> An Internet host, usually specified either as a fully qualified DNS domain name or an IP address in dotted decimal notation.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;port&gt;</code></strong> A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number to use when invoking the protocol appropriate to the scheme.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;url-path&gt;</code></strong> A resource location path. This is usually a full directory path expressing the sequence of directories to be traversed from the root directory to the place where the resource is located, and then the resource's name. For example, if on a device there is a directory called project1 and within it a subdirectory called memos containing a text file called June11th-minutes.txt, the URL path <code class="literal">project1/memos/June11th-minutes.txt</code> would refer to that resource. Note that the slash before the <code class="literal">&lt;url-path&gt;</code> is required, and while it is technically not considered part of the path, it serves the purpose of acting like the slash denoting the root directory in many file systems. Also, the <code class="literal">&lt;url-path&gt;</code> may end in a slash, which means that the path refers specifically to a directory. However, this is often not required, as the server will treat the URL as a directory reference by context when needed. A path may also refer to a virtual file, program, or another type of resource.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;params&gt;</code></strong> Scheme-specific parameters included to control how the scheme is used to access the resource. Each parameter is generally of the form <code class="literal">&lt;parameter&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>, with each parameter specification separated from the next using a semicolon.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;query&gt;</code></strong> An optional query or other information to be passed to the server when the resource is accessed.</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;fragment&gt;</code></strong> Identifies a particular place within a resource that the user of the URL is interested in.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch70s02.html#example_of_a_uniform_resource_locator_ur" title="Figure 70-1. Example of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) This diagram shows a sample URL that includes almost all of the possible elements in the general scheme syntax, each of them highlighted using shaded boxes.

Most schemes do not use every one of these elements, and furthermore, many of them are optional, even when they are valid in a particular scheme. For example, the <code class="literal">&lt;login&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;password&gt;</code> elements are officially supported for HTTP URLs, but they are very rarely used. Similarly, port numbers are often omitted, telling the client software to just use the default port number for the scheme. The "URL Schemes and Scheme-Specific Syntaxes" section of this chapter describes some of the most common URL schemes and the specific syntaxes used for them, including how and when these elements are employed.</p><p>Even though the richness of the URL syntax isn't often needed, it can be useful for supplying a wide variety of information in special cases. URLs are also very flexible in terms of how they may be expressed. For example, while a <code class="literal">&lt;host&gt;</code> element is usually a DNS name, it can also be an IP address expressed in many forms, including dotted decimal, regular decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and even a combination of these. Unfortunately, the lack of familiarity that most people have with some of these refinements has led to URLs being abused through deliberate obscuration, to get people to visit "resources" they would normally want to avoid. We'll explore this later in this chapter, in the "URL Obscuration, Obfuscation, and General Trickery" section.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="URL Fragments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="url_fragments"/>URL Fragments</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2474"/>It's worth noting that, technically, a <code class="literal">&lt;fragment&gt;</code> element is not considered a formal part of the URL by the standards that describe resource naming. The reason is that it identifies only a portion of a resource, and it is not part of the information required to identify the resource itself. It is not sent to the server but retained by the client software, to guide it in how to display or use the resource. Some would make a valid argument, however, that this distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Consider, for example, that the scheme itself is also used only by the client, as is the host itself.</p><p>The most common example of a URL fragment is specifying a particular bookmark to scroll to in displaying a web page. In practice, a fragment identifier is often treated as if it were part of a URL, since it is part of the string that specifies a URL.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Unsafe Characters and Special Encodings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="unsafe_characters_and_special_encodings"/>Unsafe Characters and Special Encodings</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2475"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2476"/>URLs are normally expressed in the standard US ASCII character set, which is the default used by most TCP/IP application protocols. Certain characters in the set are called unsafe, because they have special meaning in different contexts, and including them in a URL would lead to ambiguity or problems in of how they should be interpreted. The space character is the classic unsafe character, because spaces are normally used to separate URLs, so including one in a URL would break the URL into pieces.

A URL can theoretically contain most of the common URL syntax elements, but in practice, most are omitted. Most URLs contain only a host and a path to a resource. The port number is usually omitted, implying that the default value of 80 should be used.

However, one of the most common uses of FTP is to access and read a single file, and this is what an FTP URL allows a client to do, quickly and easily. The <code class="literal">&lt;user&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;password&gt;</code> elements are used for login and may be omitted for anonymous FTP access. The port number is usually omitted and defaults to the standard FTP control channel port, 21.</p><p>The <code class="literal">&lt;url-path&gt;</code> is interpreted as a directory structure and filename. The appropriate CWD (change working directory) commands are issued to go to the specified directory, and then a RETR (retrieve) command is issued for the named file. The optional <code class="literal">type</code> parameter can be used to indicate the file type: <code class="literal">a</code> to specify an ASCII file retrieval or <code class="literal">i</code> for an image (binary) file. The <code class="literal">type</code> parameter is often omitted from the URL, with the correct mode being set automatically by the client based on the name of the file.</p><p>For example, consider this URL:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e75312"/><pre class="programlisting">ftp://ftp.hardwarecompanyx.com/drivers/widgetdriver.zip</pre><p>This is equivalent to starting an FTP client, making an anonymous FTP connection to <a class="ulink" href="http://ftp.hardwarecompanyx.com">ftp.hardwarecompanyx.com</a>, then changing to the drivers directory and retrieving the file widgetdriver.zip. The client will retrieve the file in binary mode because it is a compressed ZIP file.</p><p>It is also possible to use an FTP URL to get a listing of the files within a particular directory. This allows users to navigate an FTP server's directory structure using URL links to find the file they want, and then retrieve it. This is done by specifying a directory name for the <code class="literal">&lt;url-path&gt;</code> and using the <code class="literal">type</code> parameter with a <code class="literal">&lt;typecode&gt;</code> of <code class="literal">d</code> to request a directory listing. Again, the <code class="literal">type</code> parameter is usually omitted, and the software figures out to send a LIST command to the server when a directory name is given in a URL.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Electronic Mail Syntax (mailto)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="electronic_mail_syntax_mailto"/>Electronic Mail Syntax (mailto)</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2482"/>A special syntax is defined to allow a URL to represent the command to send mail to a user:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e75344"/><pre class="programlisting">mailto:&lt;email-address&gt;</pre><p>The email address (see <a class="xref" href="ch75.html" title="Chapter 75. TCP/IP ELECTRONIC MAIL ADDRESSES AND ADDRESSING">Chapter 75</a>) is in standard Internet form: <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domainname&gt;</em></span>.

So, for example, <code class="literal">news://alt.food.sushi</code> means, "Access the newsgroup alt.food.sushi on the local news server, using the default news protocol." The default news protocol is normally the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP).

Then it tells the server which newsgroup to access and which article number within that newsgroup. Note that articles are numbered using a different sequence by each server, so this is still a local form of news addressing. The port number defaults to 119.</p><p>Even though the <code class="literal">nntp</code> form seems to provide a more complete resource specification, the <code class="literal">news</code> URL is more often used, because it is simpler.

<div class="sect1" title="URL Relative Syntax and Base URLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="url_relative_syntax_and_base_urls"/>URL Relative Syntax and Base URLs</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2490"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2491"/>The URL syntax described so far is sometimes said to specify an <span class="emphasis"><em>absolute URL</em></span>. This is because the information in the URL is sufficient to completely identify the resource. Absolute URLs thus have the property of being context-independent, meaning that users can access and retrieve the resource using the URL without any additional information required.</p><p>Since the entire point of a URL is to provide the information needed to locate and access a resource, it makes sense that we would want them to be absolute in definition most of the time. The problem with absolute URLs is that they can be long and cumbersome. There are cases where many different resources need to be identified that have a relationship to each other; the URLs for these resources often have many common elements. Using absolute URLs in such situations leads to a lot of excess and redundant verbiage.</p><p>In the overview of URIs at the beginning of this chapter, I gave a real-world analogy to a URL in the form of a description of an access method and location for a person retrieving a book: "Take the train to Albuquerque, then Bus #11 to 41 Albert Street, a red brick house owned by Joanne Johnson. The book you want is the third from the right on the bottom of the bookshelf on the second floor."</p><p>What if I also wanted the same person to get a second book located in the same house on the ground floor after getting the first one? Should I start by saying again, "Take the train to Albuquerque, then Bus #11 to 41 Albert Street, a red brick house owned by Joanne Johnson?" Why bother, when they are already there at that house? No, I would give a second instruction in relative terms: "Go downstairs, and also get the blue book on the wood table." This instruction only makes sense in the context of the original one.</p><p>The same need arises in URLs. Consider a web page located at <code class="literal">http://www.longdomainnamesareirritating.com/index.htm</code> that has 37 embedded graphic images in it. The poor guy stuck with maintaining this site doesn't want to have to put <code class="literal">http://www.longdomainnamesareirritating.com/</code> in front of the URL of every image.</p><p>Similarly, if we have just taken a directory listing at <code class="literal">ftp://ftp.somesitesomewhere.org/very/deep/directory/structures/also/stink/</code>, and we want to explore the parent directory, we would like to just say "go up one level," without having to say <code class="literal">ftp://ftp.somesitesomewhere.org/very/deep/directory/structures/also/</code>.</p><p>It is for these reasons that URL syntax was extended to include a relative form. In simplest terms, a relative URL is the same as an absolute URL, but with pieces of information omitted that are implied by context. Like our "Go downstairs" instruction, a relative URL does not by itself contain enough information to specify a resource. A relative URL must be interpreted within a context that provides the missing information.</p><div class="sect2" title="Interpretation Rules for Relative URLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="interpretation_rules_for_relative_urls"/>Interpretation Rules for Relative URLs</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2492"/>The context needed to find a resource from a relative URL is provided in the form of a base URL that provides the missing information. A base URL must be either a specific absolute URL or itself a relative URL that refers to some other absolute base. The base URL may be either explicitly stated or may be inferred from use. The RFCs dealing with URLs define the following three methods for determining the base URL, in the precedence in which they are listed here:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Base URL Within Document</strong></span> Some documents allow the base URL to be explicitly stated. If present, this specification is used for any relative URLs in the document.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Base URL from Encapsulating Entity</strong></span> In cases where no explicit base URL is specified in a document, but the document is part of a higher-level entity enclosing it, the base URL is the URL of the parent document. For example, a document within a body part of a MIME multipart message (see <a class="xref" href="ch76.html" title="Chapter 76. TCP/IP ELECTRONIC MAIL MESSAGE FORMATS AND MESSAGE PROCESSING: RFC 822 AND MIME">Chapter 76</a>) can use the URL of the message as a whole as the base URL for relative references.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Base URL from Retrieval URL</strong></span> If neither of those two methods are feasible, the base URL is inferred from the URL used to retrieve the document containing the relative URL.</p><p>Of these three methods, the first and third are the most common. HTML, the language used for the Web, allows a base URL to be explicitly stated, which removes any doubt about how relative URLs are to be interpreted. Failing this, the third method is commonly used for images and other links in HTML documents that are specified in relative terms.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-414"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Regular URLs are absolute, meaning that they include all of the information needed to fully specify how to access a resource. In situations where many resources need to be accessed that are approximately in the same place or are related in some way, completely specifying a URL can be inefficient. Instead, relative URLs can be used, which specify how to access a resource relative to the location of another one. A relative URL can be interpreted only within the context of a base URL that provides any information missing from the relative reference.</p></div><p>For example, let's go back to the poor slob maintaining <code class="literal">http://www.longdomainnamesareirritating.com/index.htm</code>. By default, any images referenced from that index.htm HTML document can use relative URLs—the base URL will be assumed from the name of the document itself. So he can just say <code class="literal">companylogo.gif</code> instead of <code class="literal">http://www.longdomainnamesareirritating.com/companylogo.gif</code>, as long as that file is in the same directory on the same server as index.htm.</p><p>If all three of these methods fail for whatever reason, then no base URL can be determined. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2493"/>Relative URLs in such a document will be interpreted as absolute URLs, and since they do not contain complete information, they will not work properly.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Practical Interpretation of Relative URLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="practical_interpretation_of_relative_url"/>Practical Interpretation of Relative URLs</h2></div></div></div><p>This probably seems confusing, but relative URLs are actually fairly easy to understand, because they are interpreted in a rather common-sense way. You simply take the base URL and the relative URL, and you substitute whatever information is in the relative URL for the appropriate information in the base URL to get the resulting equivalent absolute reference. In so doing, you must drop any elements that are more specific than the ones being replaced.</p><p>What do I mean by "more specific?" Well, most URLs can be considered to move from most general to most specific in terms of the location they specify. As you go from left to right, you go through the host name, then high-level directories, subdirectories, the filename, and optionally, the parameters, query, and fragment applied to the filename. If a relative URL specifies a new file name, it replaces the file name in the base URL, and any parameters, query, and fragment elements are dropped, as they no longer have meaning given that the file name has changed. If the relative URL changes the host name, the entire directory structure, filename, and everything else to the right of the host name goes away, replaced with any that might have been included in the new host name specification.</p><p>This is hard to explain in words but easy to understand with a few examples. Let's assume we start with the following explicit base URL:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e75607"/><pre class="programlisting">http://site.net/dir1/subdir1/file1?query1#bookmark1</pre><p><a class="xref" href="ch70s04.html#relative_url_specifications_and_absolute" title="Table 70-2. Relative URL Specifications and Absolute Equivalents">Table 70-2</a> shows some examples of relative URLs and how they would be interpreted.</p><div class="table"><a id="relative_url_specifications_and_absolute"/><p class="title">Table 70-2. Relative URL Specifications and Absolute Equivalents</p><div class="table-contents"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " summary="Relative URL Specifications and Absolute Equivalents"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Relative URL</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Equivalent Absolute URL</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Explanation</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>#bookmark2</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>http://site.net/dir1/subdir1/file1?query1#bookmark2</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>The URL is the same as the base URL, except that the bookmark is different.

For others, they make no sense and cannot be used. In particular, relative URLs are never used for the <code class="literal">telnet</code>, <code class="literal">mailto</code>, and <code class="literal">news</code> schemes. They are very commonly used for HTTP documents, and may also be used for FTP and file URLs.</p><p>Incidentally, there is one other very important benefit of using relative URLs: Avoiding absolute URLs in a document allows it to be more portable by eliminating hard-coded references to names that might change. Going back to our previous example, if the guy maintaining the site <code class="literal">http://www.longdomainnamesareirritating.com</code> uses only relative links to refer to graphics and other embedded objects, then if the site is migrated to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.muchshortername.com">www.muchshortername.com</a>, he will not need to edit all of his links to the new name. The significance of this in Web URLs is explored further in the detailed discussion of HTTP URLs in <a class="xref" href="ch79.html" title="Chapter 79. WORLD WIDE WEB AND HYPERTEXT OVERVIEW AND CONCEPTS">Chapter 79</a>.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-415"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> In addition to being more efficient than absolute URLs, relative URLs have the advantage that they allow a resource designer to avoid the specific mention of names. This increases the portability of documents between locations within a site or between sites.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="URL Length and Complexity Issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="url_length_and_complexity_issues"/>URL Length and Complexity Issues</h1></div></div></div><p>URLs are the most ubiquitous form of resource addressing for some very good reasons: They represent a simple, convenient, and easy-to-understand way of finding documents. Popularized by their use on the Web, URLs can now be seen in everything from electronic document lists to television commercials—a testament to their universality and ease of use.</p><p>At least, this is true most of the time.</p><p>When URLs work, they work very well. Unfortunately, there are also some concerns that arise with respect to how URLs are used. Both accidental and intentional misuse of URLs occurs on a regular basis. Part of why I have devoted so much effort to describing URLs is that most people don't really understand how they work, and this is part of why problems occur.</p><p>Many of the issues with URLs are directly due to the related matters of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2494"/>length and complexity. URLs work best when they are short and simple, so it is clear what they are about and so they are easy to manipulate. For example, <code class="literal">http://www.ibm.com</code> is recognizable to almost everyone as the website of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Similarly, you can probably figure out what this URL does without any explanation: <code class="literal">ftp://www.somecomputercompany.com/drivers/videodrivers.zip</code>.</p><p>However, as you have seen earlier in this chapter, URLs can be much more complex. In particular, the common Internet syntax used by protocols such as HTTP and FTP is extremely flexible, containing a large number of optional elements that can be used when required to provide the information necessary for a particular resource access.</p><p>The point that many elements in URL syntax are optional is important. The majority of the time, most of these optional parts are omitted, which makes URLs much simpler in practical use than they are in their descriptions. For example, even though an HTTP URL theoretically contains a user name, password, host, port, path, query, and bookmark, most URLs use only a host name and a path. This is what helps keep URLs short and easy to use.</p><p>Despite this, you will still find some rather long URLs used on the Internet, for a variety of reasons:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Long DNS Domain and Host Names</strong></span> Some people don't realize that long host names are hard to remember. If you run the Super Auto Body Shop &amp; Pizza Parlor, having a website called www.superauto.com will make it easier for your customers to find you than trying to register www.superautobodyshopandpizza.com. Yet DNS names of 15, 20, or even more characters are surprisingly common.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Long Document or Directory Names</strong></span> Similarly, short filenames are better than long ones, and again, many people don't think about this before putting files on the Internet, which makes things more difficult for those who must access them.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use of Unsafe Characters</strong></span> As discussed saw earlier in this chapter, URLs have a mechanism for dealing with unsafe characters, but it makes them longer and harder to decipher. If you have a file called "{ABC Corp} budget; draft #3; third quarter 2004.htm," the URL for it will have to be <code class="literal">%7BABC%20Corp%7D%20budget%3B%20draft%20%233%3B%20third%20quarter%202004.htm</code>. The original long filename was readable, but the URL is a mess. Naming the file "ABC budget draft 3, 3Q2004.htm" would be a better choice, and still includes enough information to be understandable. Even better, you could replace the spaces with underscores, to avoid the need for the <code class="literal">%20</code> encoding entirely: "ABC_budget_draft 3,_3Q2004.htm."</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2495"/>Parameter Strings</strong></span> In HTTP URLs, the syntax for specifying a query (following a question mark character) is often used to allow a web browser to send various types of information to a web server, especially parameters for interactive queries. These parameter strings can get quite lengthy. For example, I typed in a query to the great web search engine Google to find recipes for potato salad. This is what the URL for one of the recipe files looks like:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e75838"/><pre class="programlisting">http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22potato+salad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=
UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;selm=B826FB57.89C0%25sbrooks%40ev1.net&amp;rnum=2</pre><p>Almost all of that consists of parameters that tell the Google server exactly what document I want based on my query. It is necessary, but still cumbersome.</p><div class="sect2" title="URL Wrapping and Delimiting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="url_wrapping_and_delimiting"/>URL Wrapping and Delimiting</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2496"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2497"/>For humans, long and complex URLs are hard to remember and use. In addition to the sheer difficulty of remembering all those characters, there is the issue of URL wrapping, which occurs when they are presented in certain forms. Most programs can display only 78 or 80 characters in a single line. If a URL is longer than this, the characters of the URL will wrap onto multiple lines; when you read that Google example of parameter strings, you probably noticed that.</p><p>URL wrapping can lead to mistakes when copying a URL from one form to another, such as if you copied it from this document into your web browser. If a URL is 81 characters long, and 80 are on the first line and the last character is on the second line, many users may not realize that the URL has wrapped. I have seen URLs that are hundreds of characters long, requiring several manual copy-and-paste operations to get the URL to work.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, some software may not handle this wrapping properly either. While this is not a problem when a hyperlink is used in something like an HTML document, it can be troublesome when links are included in an email message or Usenet article.</p><p>Another issue is delimiting where a URL starts and ends when it appears. A URL begins with a scheme name that could, in theory, be used in other contexts that are not URLs. Without a clear way of labeling a URL as being a URL, a software program might not recognize it. Consider discussion of a URL in a document like this one. If I say, "Please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thissite.com">http://www.thissite.com</a>; you will see the information you need there," we all know the semicolon is part of the sentence and not part of the URL, but a computer program might not be so sure. And again, this problem is worse when a URL is long and complex, and wraps on to multiple lines of text. How does the program recognize the end of the URL?</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Explicit URL Delimiting and Redirectors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="explicit_url_delimiting_and_redirectors"/>Explicit URL Delimiting and Redirectors</h2></div></div></div><p>To resolve both the wrapping and delimiting problems, a special <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2498"/>URL super-syntax is sometimes employed, especially when URLs are used in other text. This is done by surrounding the URL in angle brackets, possibly including the label <code class="literal">URL:</code>. before the scheme name. For example, all of the following are equivalent:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e75875"/><pre class="programlisting">http://www.networkingistoodarnedcomplicated.com
&lt;http://www.networkingistoodarnedcomplicated.com&gt;
&lt;URL:http://www.networkingistoodarnedcomplicated.com&gt;</pre><p>The angle brackets indicate clearly where the URL begins and ends, making it easier for both programs and humans to deal with long URLs.</p><p>Another solution sometimes used for long URLs are redirection services, provided by many websites. For example, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tinyurl.com">http://www.tinyurl.com</a> is a free service that allows someone to create a short URL that automatically loads a resource at a much longer URL.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="URL Abbreviation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="url_abbreviation"/>URL Abbreviation</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2499"/>One final issue I want to discuss isn't related directly to long or complex URLs, but is related indirectly to the matter of length: URL <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2500"/>abbreviation. Many people use URLs so often that they become lazy when it comes to specifying URLs. They tend to leave off portions of the full URL syntax to save time and energy. I don't mean by this that they specify relative URLs, but rather, they specify absolute URLs with missing pieces.</p><p>For example, rather than type <code class="literal">http://www.sitename.com</code>, they might type <code class="literal">http:www.sitename.com</code>, leaving off the two slashes. More commonly, people omit the scheme name entirely, just entering <code class="literal">www.sitename.com</code>. Technically, this is not a URL—it is just a domain name. However, most web browsers can handle this, assuming by default that the scheme is <code class="literal">http://</code> if none is provided.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="URL Obscuration, Obfuscation, and General Trickery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="url_obscuration_obfuscation_and_general_"/>URL Obscuration, Obfuscation, and General Trickery</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2501"/>Most of the time, the owner of a resource wants the URL that refers to the resource to be short, simple and easily understood. Thus, long and complex URLs are usually the result of necessity, accident, or ignorance. Some resources need to have long names for a specific reason, such as the use of the long query string in the Google example earlier; other times, URLs are made long because the owner of the resource doesn't realize that using a long DNS host name or file name will make for a long and unwieldy URL.</p><p>Whatever the reasons for these situations, they are not deliberate. Recent years, however, have seen a dramatic rise in the use of intentionally long, complex, confusing and deliberately deceptive URLs. These URLs are either structured so that it is impossible to tell what they are, or worse, they are made to appear as if they point to one resource when they really go to another.</p><p>Why would people do this? Because they do not want to be open and honest about their "resources." And who would these people be? Why, they would be the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2502"/>spammers and con artists who overload our Internet email boxes with offers of every sort imaginable, from making you rich beyond your wildest dreams to inflating the dimensions of certain body parts to unnatural sizes.</p><p>They are afraid that if the URL indicated clearly what the "resource" was, you might not click the link, or that if you identify them as spammers you might filter out their email. They also figure that if they can make the URL appear to be something interesting, you'll load it. Even if it turns out to be something you didn't expect, maybe you'll pay attention anyway.</p><p>You may be thinking that you are too smart to be tricked into buying a product through a deceptive URL. And you would never support a spammer anyway. What a coincidence—same with me! Yet the spam keeps coming. It must work, or they wouldn't keep doing it … would they?</p><p>It is a cruel irony that the complex syntax that was built into URLs to allow them to be so flexible has been subject to exploitation. Tricksters know that most people are used to seeing simple URLs like <code class="literal">http://www.myfavoritesite.com</code> and do not realize that the full URL syntax allows the same resource to be specified in literally millions of different ways. So, desperate for hits to their websites at any cost, they keep coming up with new tricks for manipulating URLs. These are focused on HTTP scheme URLs, though in theory, the tricks can be applied to several other types as well (though they won't work with some schemes).</p><p>Here are some of the more common gimmicks that have been used (note that if you are trying these out as you read, some examples may not work on certain browsers):</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Excessive Length</strong></span> In some cases, a URL is just made really long by the addition of a lot of gibberish as a query string, so that the user's eyes glaze over just looking at it. This is a relatively unsophisticated technique, however, since you can easily tell what the real host name is by looking at the start of the URL. Most of the better scammers have moved beyond such simple tricks today.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Regular IP Address Hosts</strong></span> Internet users are so accustomed to using DNS names that they don't realize that you can access a URL using an IP address. So most people don't realize that The PC Guide can be accessed as easily using <code class="literal">&lt;http://209.68.14.80&gt;</code> as <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.PCGuide.com&gt;</code>. (Note that this is not true of all Internet hosts; those that use virtual names cannot be accessed using just an IP address.) This is not really trickery per se. It is quite legitimate, and in some ways, even necessary; for example, for accessing a site that is having DNS problems. The problem here is that usually you cannot tell what a site is from the IP address alone, and many people will just click an IP address link without bothering to find out what it is.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Numeric Domain Names</strong></span> It is possible to register a DNS domain name consisting of just a single number. For example, one could register 114.com. And then you could create subdomains within it such as 42.12.205.114.com. At first glance, this appears to be an IP address specification, so someone might think it would resolve to the address 42.12.205.114, but it's actually some other address. I believe that DNS name registrars have been cracking down on this sort of trickery, so it may not be as prevalent now as it once was.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2503"/>Bogus Authentication Information</strong></span> HTTP URLs theoretically support the inclusion of authentication information, by including <code class="literal">&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@</code> before the host in the URL. Yet the vast majority of websites are open, and neither require nor use this type of information. If you specify an authentication string and it is not needed, it is ignored. One way to abuse this is by including "authentication information" that looks like a benign host, to make the user think the URL is for that host. For example, if I wanted to trick you into visiting The PC Guide, I might use this URL to make it look like clicking it would go to CNN: <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.cnn.com@www.PCGuide.com&gt;</code>. This is still too obvious, however, so this method is often combined with some of the following techniques.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Deceptive Character Encoding</strong></span> The use of the percent sign to encode special characters such as spaces and punctuation can also be abused to obscure the name of a domain. For example, the following is another way of expressing the DNS name for The PC Guide: <code class="literal">&lt;http://%57%57%57.%50%43%47%55%49%44%45.%43%4F%4D&gt;</code>. Try it!</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IP Address Math Trickery</strong></span> Okay, this is where things get really bizarre. Most of the time, we express an IP address as a dotted decimal number. Remember, however, that to computers, the IP address is just a 32-bit binary number. Most browsers support a rather shocking number of methods for expressing these numbers. This is unfortunate, because this flexibility is really not needed and almost never used for legitimate purposes. It can lead to some really bizarre URLs that are unrecognizable or that look like regular IP addresses but are not. Here are some examples, all of which are the same as the IP address form of The PC Guide (<code class="literal">&lt;http://209.68.14.80&gt;</code>):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>An IP address in dotted octal uses a leading zero to signify where each byte is in octal, as in <code class="literal">&lt;http://0321.0104.016.0120&gt;</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An IP address in dotted hexadecimal uses a leading zero followed by an <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> to signify where each byte is in hexadecimal, as in <code class="literal">&lt;http://0xD1.0x44.0x0E.0x50&gt;</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We can even take the entire 32-bit number and express it as a single number, and that will work too. In decimal, this would look like <code class="literal">&lt;http://3510898256/&gt;</code>; in octal, <code class="literal">&lt;http://032121007120/&gt;</code>; and in hexadecimal, <code class="literal">&lt;http://0xd1440e50/&gt;</code>.</p></li></ul></div><p>As if these tricks weren't bad enough taken individually, we can have some real fun by combining them! For example, start with the regular PC Guide URL:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76016"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;http://www.PCGuide.com&gt;</pre><p>And convert it to IP:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76020"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;http://209.68.14.80&gt;</pre><p>Then add some bogus authentication gibberish:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76024"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;http://www.cnn.com@209.68.14.80&gt;</pre><p>And convert the real URL into a single number, so it looks like a document on the CNN website:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76029"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;http://www.cnn.com@3510898256&gt;</pre><p>Alternatively, we can use the octal form, and even include a lot of extra leading zeros just for fun:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76033"/><pre class="programlisting">&lt;http://www.cnn.com@0000000000000321.00000000104.00000000000016.00000120&gt;</pre><p>Believe it or not, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In some browsers, even the IP address numbers can be expressed using percent sign ASCII encoding!</p><p>While quite irritating, I must give these people points for creativity at least—some of the tricks are quite ingenious. At the same time, their inventiveness is potentially hazardous. While these false URLs are usually more a waste of time than anything harmful, there are sometimes good reasons a person would go to great lengths to hide the identity of a resource. Deceptive URLs are just one more danger that network administrators must deal with today.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-416"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> The syntax of Internet URLs includes many elements that provide great flexibility in how URLs can be constructed. Unfortunately, these capabilities of expression are now often abused by people who create intentionally obfuscated URLs to trick users into accessing their websites and other resources. Some of these can be potentially hazardous, which means that care is required before clicking unknown links or accessing strange URLs.</p></div></div>

This focus on the means of access for the resource makes URLs very practical, in that the URL usually contains all the data we need to use the resource. This is why URLs are so widely used today. However, this access orientation also means that URLs have a number of serious limitations.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Problem with URLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_problem_with_urls"/>The Problem with URLs</h2></div></div></div><p>The main difficulty with URLs is that since they describe a resource based on its location, they tie the resource and its location together inextricably. While this may not seem to be a big deal, it is actually a fairly serious matter in a number of ways, because a resource and its location are not the same thing. It is only because most Internet resources rarely change location that we don't notice this issue more often with URLs.</p><p>Suppose that your name is Joe Xavier Zachariah and you live at 44 Glendale Crescent in Sydney, Australia. If someone asked you who you were, would you say, "Joe Xavier Zachariah," or "the man living at 44 Glendale Crescent in Sydney, Australia"? Almost certainly, you would supply the former answer. But a URL would be like describing yourself as a "resource" using the latter description.</p><p>Since we realize that Mr. Zachariah is obviously not always going to be at 44 Glendale Crescent, we know that describing him using just a location is not sufficient. The same thing occurs with Internet resources when they are identified using only location.</p><p>However, the problem with Internet resources and URLs goes beyond just the matter of movement. Consider a situation where a particular resource is very popular and we want to duplicate the same resource in multiple locations. Using URLs, we would need a different identifier for each copy of the resource, even though each copy is the same. Again, the problem is that we are not identifying the resource itself, but rather the place where it can be found.</p><p>In recognition of this issue with URLs, an alternative identification mechanism for Internet resources was developed, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Uniform Resource Names (URNs)</em></span><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2506"/>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Overview of URNs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="overview_of_urns"/>Overview of URNs</h2></div></div></div><p>The basic standard describing URNs is RFC 1737, "Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names," which was published in 1994. In 1997, RFC 2141 was published, which specifies the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2507"/>syntax of URNs.</p><p>As you can probably tell from that term, a URN is intended to label a resource based on its actual identity, rather than where it can be found. So, where a URL is like Joe Zachariah's address, a URN would be his name. Or, as I gave as an example in the overview of URIs at the beginning of this chapter, a URN would be identifying a book based on its ISBN number rather than specifying which bookshelf it is on in a building.</p><p>To be useful in identifying a particular resource, it is necessary that a URN be globally unique, and that's not always as simple as it may at first appear. Consider human names, for example. Even though there is probably only one Charles Marlin Kozierok in the entire world, if your name is John Paul Smith or José Garcia, you likely share that name with thousands of others. This means using common names may not be sufficient for identifying human "resources," and some other method might need to be devised.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="URN Namespaces and Syntax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="urn_namespaces_and_syntax"/>URN Namespaces and Syntax</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2508"/>There are many types of resources that URNs are intended to identify on the Internet, each of which may require a different form of naming. To allow URNs to represent many kinds of resources, numerous <span class="emphasis"><em>URN namespaces</em></span> are defined.</p><p>A namespace is referenced using a unique string that tells the person or computer interpreting the URN what type of resource the URN identifies. The namespace also ensures the uniqueness of URNs, when a particular identifier might exist in more than one context. For example, both North American telephone numbers and ISBN numbers consist of ten digits, so a particular number such as 4167819249 could represent both a telephone number and a book number. The namespace identifier tells us what the number means when it is encountered in a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2509"/>URN.</p><p>The general syntax of a URN is as follows:</p><a id="I_programlisting1_d1e76119"/><pre class="programlisting">URN:&lt;namespace-ID&gt;:&lt;resource-identifier&gt;</pre><p>For example, a book with the ISBN number 0-679-73669-7 could be represented as <code class="literal">URN:isbn:0-679-73669-7</code>. This string identifies that particular book uniquely, wherever it might happen to be in the world. Many other namespaces have also been defined to specify the URNs for other types of resources, such as documents on the Internet.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-417"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Where URLs specify a resource based on an access method and location, Uniform Resource Names (URNs) identify a resource by name. A URN consists of a namespace identifier that indicates what type of name it contains, and a resource identifier that specifies the individual resource within the context of that namespace.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="URN Resolution and Implementation Difficulties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="urn_resolution_and_implementation_diffic"/>URN Resolution and Implementation Difficulties</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-70-2510"/>URNs are a more natural way of identifying resources, which gives them intuitive appeal. Despite this, URNs are still not widely used, even though they have been in development for more than a decade. The main reason for this is somewhat ironic: It is because URNs are independent of location! The very characteristic that provides URNs with identification advantages over URLs also makes URNs much harder to use practically, which has led to long delays in workable URN systems.</p><p>To understand the problem, consider the example <code class="literal">URN:isbn:0-679-73669-7</code>. This uniquely identifies a particular book, and will always refer to it no matter where the book may be, unlike a URL. The problem is that while the URL equivalent tells us how to actually find this book, the URN does not. The same thing goes for our previous human example: Identifying Joe Xavier Zachariah by his name is more sensible than identifying him as the man living at 44 Glendale Crescent in Sydney, Australia, but at least with the latter, we know where Joe is!</p><p>In order for URNs to be useful on an internetwork, they require an additional mechanism for translating a simple URN identification string into a particular location and/or access method. In other words, we need to be able to change a URN into the equivalent of a URL, so that the resource can be found. This requirement is analogous to the problem of resolving Internet DNS domain names into IP addresses, and the same term is used to describe it: <span class="emphasis"><em>URN resolution</em></span>.</p><p>Ideally, we want to be able to use some sort of technique where we specify the name Joe Xavier Zachariah, and we are told where Joe is so we can find him. Or, we provide the string <code class="literal">URN:isbn:0-679-73669-7</code>, and we are provided with a list of libraries or other places where the book can be found. The power of URNs can also be taken advantage of in such a system, by having the resolution system specify the location of a copy of the resource that is closest (in terms of network distance, cost, or other measurements) to the entity making the request.</p><p>However, setting up URN resolution mechanisms is a nontrivial task. The matter of URN resolution has been the subject of much of the work on URNs over the past decade. RFC 2483, "URI Resolution Services Necessary for URN Resolution," was published in 1999 and discusses some of the important issues in URN resolution. In October 2002, a series of RFCs, 3401 to 3405, defined a new system called the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)</em></span> that was designed not just to resolve URNs, but to handle the entire class of resolution problems where an identifier is given and the output is information about where to get more information about that identifier. RFC 3406 was published at the same time, providing more information about URN namespaces.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-418"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> Since URNs identify resources by name rather than location, they are a more natural way of identifying resources than using URLs. Unfortunately, this advantage is also a disadvantage, since URNs don't, by themselves, provide a user with the necessary information to find the resource so it can be used. A process of URN resolution must be performed to transform the URN into a set of information that allows the resource to be accessed.</p></div><p>Although progress on URNs has been slow, it has been steady. While it may yet be a few years before URNs are widely used, I believe it is likely that they will play an increasingly prominent role in identifying resources on the Internet in the future.</p></div></div>

In the world of computers, information is most often arranged into discrete units called <span class="emphasis"><em>files</em></span>. When those files are created specifically for the purpose of communication, they are often called <span class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span>.</p><p>Transferring files and messages between networked computers is the most basic type of network communication. For this reason, it would not be an exaggeration to say that <span class="emphasis"><em>file and message transfer applications</em></span> may be the most important class of internetworking applications. Some of the members of this group are so common that many people use them every day without even thinking about it.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-71-2511"/></p><p>In this brief introductory chapter, I take a general look at the concepts behind file and message transfer, and how different applications treat them. I begin with a discussion of the general concept behind files, then discuss the categories of applications that use them, contrasting message transfer with file transfer.</p><div class="sect1" title="File Concepts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="file_concepts"/>File Concepts</h1></div></div></div><p>To understand the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-71-2512"/>file and message transfer applications, let's first take a quick step back to look at the fundamental concept of a <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>. Simply put, a file is just a collection of information that is treated as a single unit by a computer system.</p><p>Files are stored in directories or folders in a <span class="emphasis"><em>file system</em></span>. In modern computers, files are normally expressed as a sequence of bytes or characters, and each file is read, written, copied, or otherwise manipulated as an independent object. In addition to the data it contains, each file has associated with it file <span class="emphasis"><em>attributes</em></span> that describe it.</p><p>For our purposes, the critical characteristic of a file is that it is a self-contained object carrying arbitrary information. Since files are the building blocks of information in computer systems, it's no surprise that the transfer of information in networking was originally defined in terms of the movement of files. Some of the protocols describing how to transfer files predate all of the modern protocols in the lower levels of TCP/IP, including Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It's not the case that file transfer was an early application of internetworking, but that internetworking was invented in large part to permit file transfer!</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Application Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="application_categories"/>Application Categories</h1></div></div></div><p>Files in modern computing systems are inherently designed to be generic; they can contain any type of information. The significance of the contents of a file depends entirely on the user or software program that examines it. The TCP/IP file and message transfer protocols have in common the notion of moving files from one computer to another. Where they differ is in how the files are handled and processed. There are two basic approaches: file transfer and message transfer.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-71-2513"/></p><div class="sect2" title="General File Transfer Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="general_file_transfer_applications"/>General File Transfer Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>General transfer applications normally treat files as a "black box," moving them from place to place and paying little or no attention to what the files contain. The TCP/IP File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) fall into this category. FTP has been around in one form or another for more than 30 years now and is still widely used.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-71-2514"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Message Transfer Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="message_transfer_applications"/>Message Transfer Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>Other TCP/IP applications work with particular types of files, processing and interpreting them in various ways. These files are usually designed for the specific purpose of communication, and are thus called <span class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span>; these applications allow users to construct, send, and receive messages that fit a particular message format. There are several prominent TCP/IP messaging applications we'll examine in this book.</p><div class="sect3" title="Electronic Mail (Email)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="electronic_mail_email"/>Electronic Mail (Email)</h3></div></div></div><p>Email is a system that allows users to exchange "letters" (in fact, any type of document) in a manner equivalent to the conventional postal system, but with the advantages of great speed and simplicity. Email has not replaced regular mail entirely, but many people now use it for the vast majority of their correspondence.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Network News (Usenet)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="network_news_usenet"/>Network News (Usenet)</h3></div></div></div><p>Usenet is an application that is like email in that it allows users to send messages. However, while email is normally used to allow a message to be sent to one user or a small number of recipients, network news is a way for thousands of users to share messages on various topics.</p><p>Any user can contribute a message that can be seen by others, any of whom can respond. Unlike the case with email, recipients do not need to be explicitly identified, which makes network news far more suitable to communication among large groups of people who may not even know each other. This was one of the first TCP/IP applications to create something like an electronic bulletin board: an online community.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Hypertext (World Wide Web)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="hypertext_world_wide_web"/>Hypertext (World Wide Web)</h3></div></div></div><p>You probably don't even need me to explain what the World Wide Web is, such is its great significance in modern internetworking. Hypertext moves the idea of messaging beyond the simple exchange of text messages or plain files to the notion of rich messages that can contain a variety of types of information. This includes text, graphics, multimedia, and embedded files.</p><p>Most important, hypertext allows one document to be linked to another, forming the web of related documents that led to the name World Wide Web. The Web is almost certainly the single most important TCP/IP application, used daily by millions of people.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="The Merging of File and Message Transfer Methods"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_merging_of_file_and_message_transfer"/>The Merging of File and Message Transfer Methods</h2></div></div></div><p>In recent years, a number of developments have caused the lines between applications that transfer files and applications that transfer messages to become greatly blurred. Email is no longer limited to simple text messages; it can now be used to carry general files by encoding them into text form using special methods, and even to carry hypertext documents. World Wide Web clients (browsers) continue to be enhanced to let them access other types of servers and files, and can also be used for general file transfer.</p><p>These developments mean even more functionality and flexibility for the TCP/IP user—and a bit more care required on the part of you, the TCP/IP learner.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip-419"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></span> One of the most important groups of TCP/IP applications is the one that enables files to be moved between devices on an internetwork: file and message transfer applications. This group contains many of the common applications that TCP/IP users employ every day to communicate. It can be broken into two main categories: general file transfer applications that are used to move any type of file between devices, and message transfer applications, which allow different types of communication using special file types, such as electronic-mail messages or hypertext files.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
