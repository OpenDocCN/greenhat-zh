    and experiments performed on pieces of hardware wil require a custom cable to
    adapt your existing connectors to what you need.

- en: In this chapter, you will learn how to build a USB adapter cable for the Xbox,
    something not available in most retail outlets (although select online vendors,
    such as Lik-Sang (www.lik-sang.com) do carry this item). A USB adapter allows
    standard USB hubs, keyboards, and mice to be connected to the Xbox for the purpose
    of running Linux. (This chapter presents the basics of robust cable building in
    a tutorial fashion; experienced hardware hackers should feel free to skim or skip
    it.)

    (available at any video game retailer), and the USB extension cord. If you want
    to use something different, see Appendix F, “Xbox Hardware Reference,” for the
    pinouts of the various connectors employed by the Xbox.

- en: When building the Xbox USB adapter cable, the basic idea is to cut the Xbox
    breakaway cable and the USB extension cable in half and to join the proper ends
    of the two cables. Fortunately, there is a standard wiring code for USB-compliant
    cables. Red is +5V power, black is Ground, White is Data (-), and Green is Data
    (+). In order to join the cables together, simply connect wires of like colors
    together. (Note that the Xbox cable will have an extra yellow wire that carries
    a copy of the composite video sync signal for use in light-gun type game interfaces.
    This extra yellow wire can be safely ignored.) This chapter will walk you step-by-step
    through connecting the wires and sealing the cable.

    and cut the USB extension cable near the female connector end. Discard the male
    half of the USB extension cable and the half of the Xbox cable with the smaller
    connector.

    cable, as illustrated in frame 1 of Figure 4-3\. Peel the insulation back to reveal
    the wires, which will be protected by a braided metal shield and some metal foil.
    Peel the metal braiding and foil back, and cut off the excess insulation and shielding.
    Strip the ends of the red, green, white, and black wires so that about 1/8" of
    bare conductor is showing. (Do not strip the yellow wire in the Xbox breakaway
    cable.) Dip the bare ends of the conductors into some solder flux. (See Figure
    4-3.)

- en: If you are concerned about the robustness or safety of the adapter cable assembly,
    slip a 1-1/4" segment of heat shrink tubing onto one of the cables. (This tubing
    will later be slipped over the bare solder joints and filled with hot glue to
    make a robust connection.) The shielding is not mandatory, but the cable will
    not be as robust without the heat shrink reinforcement; it will be susceptible
    to breakage if subjected to repeated bending or straining.

- en: Continue the cable building process by soldering together wires of like colors,
    as shown in Figure 4-4\. Have a friend help you hold the cables in place while
    you solder them, or use a “third hand” tool (Jameco order number 26690) with alligator
    clips to hold the cable in place. All of the solder joints should look smooth
    and shiny. Give a firm tug on each joint to verify that the solder connection
    is good. Wrap a small piece of electrical tape around the open joints to prevent
    the exposed joints from shorting together. **Test the cable** before proceeding
    to the next step where the joints will be **permanently** encased.

    robust casing around the solder joints for mechanical reinforcement, as shown
    in Figure 4-5\. Place a couple of small dabs of hot glue over the open solder
    joints to hold them in place so they do not short against each other, slip the
    heat shrink tubing over the solder joints, then fill both sides of the tubing
    with hot glue. The tubing should shrink from the heat of the glue and form a solid,
    permanent conformal case over the joint. (The hot glue acts as a strain relief
    for the joint as well, thus the cable will be robust under most normal operating
    circumstances.)

    tubing treatment, you can still improve the connection’s stability if you do not
    have these items handy. Electrical tape can be wrapped carefully around the individual
    joints as a makeshift mechanical reinforcement.
