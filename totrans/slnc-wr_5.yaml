- en: This is where the book ends, but where I hope your journey begins. I have taken
    pride in guiding you through the world of complex and uncommon security problems
    that I most enjoy, and I hope you have shared my passion. Whether you are a seasoned
    security professional—perhaps more experienced and knowledgeable than I—or just
    an enthusiast discovering this field, I hope that I have given you a new perspective
    on security, as a challenge and art all its own, not a set of obstacles that must
    be eliminated or worked around.

  zh: 这本书就到这里结束，但我希望您的旅程从这里开始。我为能引导您穿越我最喜欢的复杂且不寻常的安全问题世界而感到自豪，并希望您能分享我的热情。无论您是一位经验丰富的安全专业人士——可能比我更有经验和知识——还是一位刚刚发现这个领域的爱好者，我希望我已经为您提供了对安全的新视角，将其视为一种挑战和艺术，而不是必须消除或绕过的障碍。
- en: By understanding the subtle relationships between seemingly unrelated components
    and processes, you can effectively tackle the most dangerous and pervasive security
    problems and assess and mitigate everyday risks more efficiently. Security problems
    should be seen as a function of a solution to virtually every challenge in the
    world of IT, no matter how trivial or limited in scope; not as the adverse circumstances
    of doing business. Only by seeing the magic and charm of the complementary universes
    and the subtle ways they interact can we avoid routine and begin to really enjoy
    our work, or understand our hobby.

  zh: 通过理解看似无关的组件和过程之间的微妙关系，你可以有效地应对最危险和普遍存在的安全问题，并更有效地评估和减轻日常风险。安全问题应被视为解决IT世界中几乎所有挑战的函数，无论其多么微不足道或范围有限；而不是作为商业活动的逆境。只有通过看到互补宇宙的神奇魅力以及它们之间微妙互动的方式，我们才能避免常规，真正开始享受我们的工作，或理解我们的爱好。
