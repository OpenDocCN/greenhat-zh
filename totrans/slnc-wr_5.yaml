- en: This is where the book ends, but where I hope your journey begins. I have taken
    pride in guiding you through the world of complex and uncommon security problems
    that I most enjoy, and I hope you have shared my passion. Whether you are a seasoned
    security professional—perhaps more experienced and knowledgeable than I—or just
    an enthusiast discovering this field, I hope that I have given you a new perspective
    on security, as a challenge and art all its own, not a set of obstacles that must
    be eliminated or worked around.

    and processes, you can effectively tackle the most dangerous and pervasive security
    problems and assess and mitigate everyday risks more efficiently. Security problems
    should be seen as a function of a solution to virtually every challenge in the
    world of IT, no matter how trivial or limited in scope; not as the adverse circumstances
    of doing business. Only by seeing the magic and charm of the complementary universes
    and the subtle ways they interact can we avoid routine and begin to really enjoy
    our work, or understand our hobby.
