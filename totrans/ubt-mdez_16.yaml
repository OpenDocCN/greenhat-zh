    to turn to the equally important area of video. Ubuntu is quite capable in terms
    of video, allowing you to view DVDs, video CDs (VCDs), video files you download
    from the Internet, and some Internet video streams. It also allows you to download
    video movie files from your digital camera, or to capture movies from tape-based
    digital video cameras and then edit them.

    be the vast majority of them), you need to install a whole bunch of stuff—most

    hooked up to your TV, because the vast majority of standalone DVD players in the
    United States (I would venture to guess 99.9 percent) do not allow you to play
    anything other than Region 1 NTSC discs (NTSC being the broadcast standard in
    the United States and what US televisions are designed to display, and 1 being
    the DVD region). This information is usually provided on the back of DVD packages
    (see the examples in [Figure 16-1](ch16.html#examples_of_regional_encoding_labels_on

    playback, there is a serious caveat to bear in mind. Depending on the manufacturer
    of your DVD drive, you will be able to switch back and forth between DVDs of differing
    regional encodings only four or five times. After that, the drive will be locked
    into the regional encoding of the disc you were playing at that time . . . *forever*.
    This is unrelated to your operating system—it is strictly a hardware matter. The
    only exception to this region-lock rule are those DVDs labeled *Region Free* or
    ALL (sometimes inaccurately labeled *Region 0*), which can be played on any DVD
    player in any region and thus do not register as a regional encoding switch when
    you plop one of them in your computer’s DVD drive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your drive does eventually lock into one regional encoding, especially one
    for which you have few DVDs, there is some good news. That comes in the form of
    Videolan’s *libdvdcss2*, the library that is included in the *libdvdread4* package
    you installed in Project 16A. The *libdvdcss2* library allows you to play back
    encrypted DVDs. In addition to that primary function, *libdvdcss2* also, in theory,
    allows you to play back DVDs from multiple regions even if your DVD drive is already
    locked into one region. It does this by performing a cryptic attack (to use Videolan’s
    term for it) on your drive until it can find the disc key for that drive. Of course,
    this process of cryptic bombardment can take several minutes, so it is not the
    optimal way of going about things. It’s better than being stuck, though. Whether
    this process of bypassing regional encodings is legal remains a subject of debate,
    so if you are concerned about such things, you should do a little research.

    the less daunting Thoggen DVD Ripper are worth checking out. You might also be
    interested in DVD95 and the more highly configurable K9copy, which are the Linux
    world’s answers to DVDShrink. These applications allow you to rip dual-layer DVDs
    (DVD9) and compress the output so that it will fit on a single-layer blank DVD
    disc (DVD5). For creating your own DVDs from scratch (as you would with iDVD),
    a couple of applications are worth considering: DVD Styler and Bombono DVD.'
