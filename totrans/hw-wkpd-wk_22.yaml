- en: Wikimedia site content is freely licensed. This means anyone can reuse Wikimedia
    content in any number of ways, for commercial or noncommercial purposes. Under
    the site's license, you have the freedom to reuse and remix content, provided
    that the same license is retained for your new creations—a radical departure from
    traditional notions of copyright. Not only can you become an editor and rewrite
    Wikipedia articles, but you are also free to use the material elsewhere, as long
    as you follow some specific and fairly simple guidelines. Reuse is part of the
    WMF's fundamental aim to distribute knowledge and content as widely as possible.
    The conditions of reuse come with the license chosen for the Wikimedia sites,
    which is, in most cases, the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), printed at
    the back of this book. Here we'll briefly discuss reusing Wikipedia content.

- en: The general policy that outlines reuse of Wikipedia content is at [[Wikipedia:Reusing
    Wikipedia content]], but the legal requirements for reuse come from the text of
    the GFDL license. The Wikimedia sites can be forked or *mirrored* (copied) in
    their entirety, or individual pages can be copied or reprinted. Under the GFDL,
    direct copying is referred to as *verbatim copying*, whereas creating new versions
    of works by changing or adding to Wikipedia content is referred to as making a
    *modified version* or producing a *derivative work*.

    work, to be reproduced in all copies of that work (for websites, this copy of
    the license should be locally hosted). The license can be found at [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

    including either a prominent link to the original article history on Wikipedia
    or a list of all the authors from the article's history along with crediting text
    such as, "This page uses material from the Wikipedia article <*name of article*>."

    copy) of the article you're using. (The transparent copy for a Wikipedia article
    can be any of a number of formats available from Wikipedia, including the wiki
    text, the HTML web pages, the XML feed, and so on.)

- en: You may be able to fulfill the latter two obligations partially by providing
    a conspicuous direct link to the article hosted on Wikipedia. Moreover, for the
    purposes of creating derivative works of individual Wikipedia articles, a direct
    link to the particular Wikipedia article used is generally considered to be in
    compliance with the GFDL (provided your derivative work is also licensed under
    the GFDL).

  zh: 你可能可以通过提供指向维基百科上托管文章的显眼直接链接来部分履行后两个义务。此外，为了创建单个维基百科文章的衍生作品，通常认为直接链接到特定的维基百科文章符合GFDL的要求（前提是你的衍生作品也根据GFDL许可）。
- en: As set out at [[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Definitions and trademarks]], Wikipedia
    considers each Wikipedia article to be an individual document. Wikipedia does
    not use invariant sections or cover texts. *Fair-use* content, such as fair-use
    images, does not fall under the GFDL license as such, but under the fair-use (or
    similar) regulations of the country where the media are retrieved; any such images
    should be credited to their original sources rather than Wikipedia. You can find
    more information about the copyright policy at [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]. Content
    that is also in the public domain, such as older texts or photos from government
    agencies, can be copied without restriction; but if the text or photo has been
    modified on Wikipedia, the terms of the GFDL must be followed.

  zh: 如[[Wikipedia:版权#定义和商标]]所述，维基百科认为每个维基百科文章都是一份独立的文档。维基百科不使用不变部分或封面文本。"合理使用"的内容，如合理使用的图像，不适用于GFDL许可，而是适用于媒体检索国家的合理使用（或类似）法规；此类图像应归功于其原始来源，而不是维基百科。你可以在[[Wikipedia:版权]]中找到有关版权政策的更多信息。属于公共领域的作品，如旧文本或政府机构的老照片，可以无限制地复制；但如果文本或照片在维基百科上进行了修改，则必须遵守GFDL条款。

  zh: 重新利用的例子
- en: Examples of reuse include printing Wikipedia articles in a book or magazine,
    hosting them on another reference website, or issuing a collection of articles
    on CD. Several selections of Wikipedia content have been released on a CD or DVD.
    The first was a German version published by Directmedia Publishing in October
    2004\. It was followed by a DVD-ROM of articles in April 2005\. The DVD was wildly
    popular, selling out all 10,000 copies within 10 days.

    Publishing出版的德语版本。随后是2005年4月发布的文章DVD-ROM。这个DVD非常受欢迎，在10天内售罄了所有10,000份。
- en: In April 2006, a Wikipedia CD Selection was put together by the charity SOS
    Children. This CD was the first English-language CD version of Wikipedia and featured
    around 2,000 articles of particular interest to schools and children. The articles
    were selected by volunteers working for SOS Children, checked for suitability,
    and cleaned up. This CD was followed up in 2007 with a DVD selection called the
    "Wikipedia Selection for Schools," which SOS Children UK launched in coordination
    with the Wikimedia Foundation. This release was significantly larger, with 4,625
    articles (or the equivalent of 15 printed encyclopedia volumes). A 2008 release
    is also planned.

  zh: 2006年4月，慈善机构SOS Children制作了维基百科CD精选集。这是维基百科的第一个英文版CD，包含了约2,000篇对学校和儿童特别有吸引力的文章。这些文章由SOS
    Children的志愿者挑选，经过适宜性检查和整理。2007年，SOS Children UK与维基媒体基金会合作推出了名为“维基百科学校精选”的DVD精选集。这个版本的内容量显著增加，共有4,625篇文章（相当于15卷印刷百科全书）。还计划在2008年发布一个版本。
- en: In July 2007, the Polish Wikipedia was released on DVD by the Wikimedia Polska
    chapter, in cooperation with Helion SA. This DVD edition contained around 239,000
    articles (and 59,000 images) and was put together by a combination of volunteers
    and paid editors who checked over the articles.

- en: Also in 2007, the Wikipedia 1.0 WikiProject released its first DVD ("Version
    0.5") with Linterweb, containing approximately 2,000 high-quality articles from
    the English-language Wikipedia. These articles were selected through the WikiProject,
    which assesses articles for quality specifically in preparation for releases in
    print or CD/DVD, as well as gathering collections of *core articles*, selections
    of important topics that every encyclopedia should have.

- en: Printing Wikipedia has often been discussed but has proved trickier as a practical
    proposition than selecting articles for a disk. The German Wikipedia has led the
    way with printed selections of articles called *Wikireaders*, which were published
    by a company called WikiPress, an offshoot of Directmedia. In 2008, Bertelsmann,
    a German publisher, announced that it would work with the German Wikimedia chapter
    to produce *The Wikipedia Encyclopaedia in one volume*, a selection of the opening
    paragraphs of some 50,000 articles.
