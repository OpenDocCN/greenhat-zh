- en: Wikimedia site content is freely licensed. This means anyone can reuse Wikimedia
    content in any number of ways, for commercial or noncommercial purposes. Under
    the site's license, you have the freedom to reuse and remix content, provided
    that the same license is retained for your new creations—a radical departure from
    traditional notions of copyright. Not only can you become an editor and rewrite
    Wikipedia articles, but you are also free to use the material elsewhere, as long
    as you follow some specific and fairly simple guidelines. Reuse is part of the
    WMF's fundamental aim to distribute knowledge and content as widely as possible.
    The conditions of reuse come with the license chosen for the Wikimedia sites,
    which is, in most cases, the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), printed at
    the back of this book. Here we'll briefly discuss reusing Wikipedia content.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The general policy that outlines reuse of Wikipedia content is at [[Wikipedia:Reusing
    Wikipedia content]], but the legal requirements for reuse come from the text of
    the GFDL license. The Wikimedia sites can be forked or *mirrored* (copied) in
    their entirety, or individual pages can be copied or reprinted. Under the GFDL,
    direct copying is referred to as *verbatim copying*, whereas creating new versions
    of works by changing or adding to Wikipedia content is referred to as making a
    *modified version* or producing a *derivative work*.

    your own website, reprint the article in a book or magazine, or reprint images,
    these conditions apply:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'New works that use GFDL-licensed content have to be licensed, in turn, under
    the GFDL: The license cannot be changed. (Because of this clause, the GFDL is
    often referred to as a *viral* license.)'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must include a full copy of the GFDL license text with any GFDL-licensed
    work, to be reproduced in all copies of that work (for websites, this copy of
    the license should be locally hosted). The license can be found at [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must acknowledge the authorship of the article(s) you reuse; this can mean
    including either a prominent link to the original article history on Wikipedia
    or a list of all the authors from the article's history along with crediting text
    such as, "This page uses material from the Wikipedia article <*name of article*>."
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must provide access to the *transparent copy* (in other words, a machine-readable
    copy) of the article you're using. (The transparent copy for a Wikipedia article
    can be any of a number of formats available from Wikipedia, including the wiki
    text, the HTML web pages, the XML feed, and so on.)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be able to fulfill the latter two obligations partially by providing
    a conspicuous direct link to the article hosted on Wikipedia. Moreover, for the
    purposes of creating derivative works of individual Wikipedia articles, a direct
    link to the particular Wikipedia article used is generally considered to be in
    compliance with the GFDL (provided your derivative work is also licensed under
    the GFDL).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As set out at [[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Definitions and trademarks]], Wikipedia
    considers each Wikipedia article to be an individual document. Wikipedia does
    not use invariant sections or cover texts. *Fair-use* content, such as fair-use
    images, does not fall under the GFDL license as such, but under the fair-use (or
    similar) regulations of the country where the media are retrieved; any such images
    should be credited to their original sources rather than Wikipedia. You can find
    more information about the copyright policy at [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]. Content
    that is also in the public domain, such as older texts or photos from government
    agencies, can be copied without restriction; but if the text or photo has been
    modified on Wikipedia, the terms of the GFDL must be followed.

- en: Examples of reuse include printing Wikipedia articles in a book or magazine,
    hosting them on another reference website, or issuing a collection of articles
    on CD. Several selections of Wikipedia content have been released on a CD or DVD.
    The first was a German version published by Directmedia Publishing in October
    2004\. It was followed by a DVD-ROM of articles in April 2005\. The DVD was wildly
    popular, selling out all 10,000 copies within 10 days.

- en: In April 2006, a Wikipedia CD Selection was put together by the charity SOS
    Children. This CD was the first English-language CD version of Wikipedia and featured
    around 2,000 articles of particular interest to schools and children. The articles
    were selected by volunteers working for SOS Children, checked for suitability,
    and cleaned up. This CD was followed up in 2007 with a DVD selection called the
    "Wikipedia Selection for Schools," which SOS Children UK launched in coordination
    with the Wikimedia Foundation. This release was significantly larger, with 4,625
    articles (or the equivalent of 15 printed encyclopedia volumes). A 2008 release
    is also planned.

- en: In July 2007, the Polish Wikipedia was released on DVD by the Wikimedia Polska
    chapter, in cooperation with Helion SA. This DVD edition contained around 239,000
    articles (and 59,000 images) and was put together by a combination of volunteers
    and paid editors who checked over the articles.

- en: Also in 2007, the Wikipedia 1.0 WikiProject released its first DVD ("Version
    0.5") with Linterweb, containing approximately 2,000 high-quality articles from
    the English-language Wikipedia. These articles were selected through the WikiProject,
    which assesses articles for quality specifically in preparation for releases in
    print or CD/DVD, as well as gathering collections of *core articles*, selections
    of important topics that every encyclopedia should have.

- en: Printing Wikipedia has often been discussed but has proved trickier as a practical
    proposition than selecting articles for a disk. The German Wikipedia has led the
    way with printed selections of articles called *Wikireaders*, which were published
    by a company called WikiPress, an offshoot of Directmedia. In 2008, Bertelsmann,
    a German publisher, announced that it would work with the German Wikimedia chapter
    to produce *The Wikipedia Encyclopaedia in one volume*, a selection of the opening
    paragraphs of some 50,000 articles.

    Wikipedia articles with other reference sources; [http://www.answers.com/](http://www.answers.com/)
    and [http://www.reference.com/](http://www.reference.com/) are just two such sites.
