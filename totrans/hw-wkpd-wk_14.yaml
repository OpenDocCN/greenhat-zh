    involved in some aspect of Wikipedia—whether rewriting an article, reverting vandalism,
    or discussing issues with other users—you're well on your way to becoming a Wikipedian.
    *Wikipedians*, of course, are those individuals who make Wikipedia work—members
    of the Wikipedia community.

    they even have their own mascot, the *Wikipede* ([Figure 11-1](#wikipede_an_unofficial_mascot
    "Figure 11-1. Wikipede, an unofficial mascot")). You'll get a better sense of
    this culture as you participate in the project. Many people find themselves with
    some free time on their hands and decide to do some work on the site, but working
    on a wiki can be pleasurable, even addictive, and working on encyclopedia articles
    turns out to be fun. Before they know it, some editors are drawn in and hooked
    on Wikipedia. And as you edit articles, you'll come to know some of these quirky,
    wonderful people.

    to consider when you do so), create a user page, personalize your experience on
    the wiki, and talk with other editors via personal user talk pages. Wikipedia
    has different classes of editor accounts, as some editors become administrators,
    and we'll explain this process as well.

    courage to actually edit the site the first time, in the summer of 2003\. It was
    browsing, in fact, that convinced me to edit. I carefully read the onsite directions
    before editing, rather than plunging right in, but it still took a few saves to
    get the syntax right. I edited [[Jewelry]], which needed some serious fixing up.
    I felt somewhat qualified to work on this page as I'd been an amateur jeweler

    is recommended for all contributors. Editors have two options: They can either
    register an account and edit under that username or edit without logging in, as
    an *anonymous* or *IP editor* (referring to the way that edits show up by IP number
    when an editor is not logged in). Because by now Wikipedia is a very visible and
    public place, editing anonymously versus choosing a username has some implications,
    which we will review in this chapter. If you do decide to register, you''ll follow
    three steps to create an account: Choose an appropriate username, make sure it
    is available, and fill out a short form.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating an account is a good idea for several reasons. The first is that it
    gives you an *identity* on the site that is distinct from your IP address. You
    will be able to sign comments and discussion posts with a name that people will
    remember, not a string of numbers. An account helps you become a trusted editor
    because other contributors see a username as a commitment to doing productive
    work on the site. Others will be more likely to remember you and will more readily
    assume that your changes are good ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    participate in the Wikipedia community. If you have an account, people will also
    be able to send you email, without your having to reveal your email address to
    them, through the Email This User feature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your username, you'll be able to create new pages, move pages to new titles, and
    upload images. You will also be able to edit *semiprotected* pages (see [Chapter 5](hw-wkpd-wk_07.html
    "Chapter 5. Basic Editing") for an explanation of these). Finally, having an account
    gives you access to the site's user-specific features, such as choosing display
    options and preferences and maintaining an automated watchlist of pages you're
    interested in.

    restrictions are automatically lifted. This is known as *autoconfirmation* and

    is better. You should know, however, that Wikipedia usernames are much more public
    than usernames in most Internet forums. Wikipedia content—including user pages
    and article histories with usernames—is mirrored and archived by hundreds of other
    websites. If you're concerned about privacy, realize that whatever username you

    you if you reveal your real name on your user page or otherwise.

    by creating an account under a pseudonym and never editing the site when logged

    the address that your computer uses to identify itself to the network. Since an
    IP number's owner can often be traced quite easily by *whois* searches and other
    more advanced methods, IP editing is not anonymous. How much information is revealed
    through anonymous editing varies, however. IP addresses do not always identify
    individual computers; *dynamic* IP addresses, such as those used by many Internet
    service providers and wireless hotspots, may only reveal the Internet provider
    being used.

    Monobook solely as an alert to this possibility; the logged-out view of the site

    you can find it at [http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/](http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/).
    Thus you can discover anonymous edits and match them to their origins. This means,
    as several newspaper articles gleefully pointed out in 2007, that the IP range
    used by a politician's office, for instance, can be checked to see if people editing
    from there have changed the article on that politician in a way that violates

    real name, initials, or first or last name as a professional way to present yourself.
    Many people do use their real names when editing the site (including the authors
    of this book). Depending on how common the person's name is, contributions can
    then be traced more readily back to an individual, which can, for instance, provide
    a way of corroborating claimed expertise. The benefit of choosing a pseudonym,
    on the other hand, is that it offers a degree of real anonymity. Pseudonyms are
    perfectly acceptable and widely used on the site. Whatever you choose for your
    name, you'll become known by it if you make substantial contributions. Choose
    a username that you are comfortable signing in serious discussion and debate.

- en: Wikipedia has a handful of commonsense guidelines for usernames designed to
    minimize disruption in collaborative work. Usernames cannot be harassing, misleading,
    confusing, promotional, or offensive. What constitutes these qualities is ultimately
    determined by administrators who review new accounts; if a name violates these
    guidelines, an administrator will ban it, and the editor will be expected to pick
    something else. *Harassing* is a username that is aimed at disturbing others,
    such as one that incorporates an attack on a specific user. *Misleading* means
    imitating another well-known person or Wikipedian, whereas *confusing* means visually
    confusing (such as nothing but ones and zeros). A *promotional* username is one
    that seeks to promote, or is the same as, a business or a group; so don't use
    the name of your company as a username. Finally, *offensive* usernames are those
    that others might find so offensive as to make positive collaborative editing
    impossible; any derogatory statements or names using obscenities are generally
    ruled out.

    is to request that any user pages be deleted; this is part of the wiki-philosophy

    or any other identifiable information about yourself, particularly if you don't
    want your identity on Wikipedia linked to other online presences or public roles
    you may have. Just to drive this point home, a search for *Charles Matthews*—a
    fairly common name—now leads directly to one author's very own user page in the
    top few search engine hits. Furthermore, if you're interested in getting involved
    in the administrative side of the site, that may involve controversy. Any disclosure
    may attract online stalkers; in a few cases, the antagonists of administrators
    have tracked down real-life information such as phone numbers. This is unlikely

    don't trust your edits to art articles will probably be more likely to check their

    as a professional activity, no less important than working on another encyclopedia
    or scholarly work that merits the respect of others. If you're known in your field
    or recognized as an expert, about the only way to prove it is to use your real

    more intense scrutiny by other editors for strict neutrality. Self-knowledge helps
    here. If despite having a commitment to a political party, you really can be neutral
    in editing political articles, then your reputation as a good editor will grow.
    If, however, you really cannot be neutral about the company you work for (and
    many people would find that hard), then if you do edit the article about this
    company, your declaration may make matters worse. However, fair-minded folk will

    Wikipedia occurred early in 2006, in a huge controversy over an apparently minor
    matter of onsite policy. *Userboxes (boxen*, to some of those unconvinced on their
    centrality to the project) are small rectangular templates designed to be placed
    on a user page to help with various types of self-identification. "This user is
    a Scorpio" is a harmless example. But what about "This user enjoys pornography"
    or "This user supports Senator John McCain for president in 2008?" What about
    the spoof language box, "This person does not understand Bullshit (or understands
    it with considerable difficulties)"? Or "This user is a Wiccan?" These are all
    real examples. The question was over whether these were helpful to the site or,
    in some cases, inflammatory and whether they should allowed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first userboxes were the language templates mentioned previously, but the
    userbox fad came to prominence shortly after a rapid influx of new editors in
    late 2005\. Once the fad caught on, userboxes addressing all issues of religion
    and politics, profanity and sexuality, were being created. These userboxes became
    the focus of a fervid argument, essentially about free speech; the question was
    whether Wikipedia was a free forum for its users or a working environment that
    needed some regulation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thousands of userboxes having been created, deleting those clearly created only
    to test how far Wikipedia was committed to allowing free expression and self-identification
    took a while, and a great deal of argument (including one notable case of administrator
    edit-warring) took place regarding some of the boxes. The debate was ultimately
    settled by some decisions on namespaces; box templates held in the User namespace
    (rather than the Template namespace) are now less "official." Some arguments do
    still persist, however, about what a user page may contain (whether boxed up or
    not). However, Wikipedia is not a dedicated discussion forum, and the general
    consensus was that self-identification on the site should help the project, not
    be seen as an end in itself. See [[Wikipedia:Userboxes]] (shortcut WP:BOX) for
    a deceptively calm account of the controversy and a list of userboxes, most related

    in all namespaces. Any contributor's history of edits and total edit count is
    publicly accessible; a record of all changes made by any account or IP address
    is kept. For any registered account, the user's editing history can be found from
    [[Special:Contributions/*Nameofuser*]], where *Nameofuser* is replaced by the
    user account name. If you want to see your own contributions, you can just click
    My Contributions in the upper-right corner, next to My Watchlist. Checking your

    total edit count, especially if that editor has made more than a few thousand
    edits. You can monitor your own edit count by checking at My Preferences; the
    count is posted just below your username. To check another contributor's edit
    count, in addition to [[Special:Contributions]] (which gives you a list of edits
    but doesn't provide a total number), you can use several automated tools that
    count edits for a given username. These tools can be found at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject
    edit counters]]. One caveat is these edit counters are provided as fun utilities,
    not as crucial project tools, and they tend to go offline or be unpredictably
    withdrawn. To see the top contributors, Wikipedia has a list, which is updated
    but not always regularly, at [[Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits]]
    (shortcut WP:WBE). This list currently gives you an idea of the edit counts for
    the top 3,000 or so editors; as of 2008, you need at least 5,000 edits to appear
    on the list.

    editors in elections (for instance, in previous years voters for Wikimedia Foundation
    board members had to have at least 400 edits on a single Wikimedia wiki), so having
    a certain edit count may bring suffrage in elections where only community members
    may participate. Additionally, the edit counts and patterns for administrator
    candidates are also debated (though no particular number is asked for, a count
    in the low thousands of edits or more is generally required to pass in Requests
    for Adminship, described in "Administrators" on [Administrators](#administrators
    "Administrators")). In other words, edit count is a measure of how experienced
    someone is as a Wikipedia editor.

    with experience editing Wikipedia, this correlation is rough. Don't think better
    of someone just because he is poor at finding the preview button. The raw edit
    count is crude and undiscriminating—counting typo fixes and vandalism reverts
    is the same as adding thoughtful content or references, though anyone who is truly
    interested can, of course, sample an account's contributions and draw better conclusions
    about the quality of an editor's work. Historically, the most committed individual
    editors, editing normally, have contributed at a peak rate of around 3,000 edits
    a month, or 100 a day. This rate requires full use of free time and not having
    a life outside Wikipedia and is not necessarily sustainable.

    the site and to be much better informed about the workings of Wikipedia than the
    average user. They are usually good, helpful people to ask about procedures and
    for help in editing disputes. Admins represent the community of Wikipedia editors
    in the sense that they are, in almost all cases, elected volunteers who give time

    not yet have one). Wikipedia has far fewer bureaucrats than admins (and requests

    bad fortune) in battling against it. The site is administered by the community,
    for the community. In the next chapter, we'll talk about the culture of this community
    and Wikipedian motivations, the public discussion forums where you can talk to
    other editors, and some of the ins and outs of participating in the community
    aspects of the site.
