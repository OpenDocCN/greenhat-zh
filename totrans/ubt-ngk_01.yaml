    world of Linux. If you have already made the commitment and have Ubuntu installed
    on your machine, you are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have made
    the commitment psychologically but have yet to act on that commitment. And some
    of you are probably reading these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering
    about Linux and about whether you should spend your money on this book or on a
    latté every morning for the next couple of weeks. For those in this last group,
    I can only say, "Get this book." Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.

    Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and what
    you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions along
    the way and, if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by the time
    you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, your doubts will
    be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. Anyway, until
    you are ready to make the commitment, you can still follow along, because the
    CD that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu installer, a
    live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience
    without having to even touch what you have on your hard drive. You can kick back,
    put your worries in check, and go with the flow.

    Linux。您可以放松身心，放下担忧，顺其自然。

    it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it
    to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The

- en: You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many operating
    systems that exist today, or did in the past. Windows, DOS, OS/2, and Mac OS are
    all such operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different
    from these other operating systems, in terms of both its capabilities and its
    heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wanna-be
    out to make money. The Linux core, referred to as the *kernel*, was created by
    computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a member of Finland's Swedish ethnic minority,
    who wanted to create a Unix-like system that would work on home computers—particularly
    his.

  zh: 您已经知道，并且可能已经使用过今天存在或过去存在的许多操作系统之一。Windows、DOS、OS/2和Mac OS都是这样的操作系统，Linux也是其中之一。然而，Linux在能力和血统方面都与这些其他操作系统不同。Linux不是由一个公司或一些想要赚钱的准公司创建的。Linux的核心，被称为*内核*，是由计算机爱好者林纳斯·托瓦兹（Linus
    Torvalds）创建的，他是芬兰瑞典族少数族裔的成员，他想要创建一个类似Unix的系统，可以在家用计算机上运行——尤其是他的。
- en: Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world,
    so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it better and more

    devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, reliable,
    free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, on
    its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no
    windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are
    behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen,
    command line–driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as DOS on
    steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.

  zh: 自从1991年Linux创建以来，Linux已经获得了许多粉丝和追随者。这些信徒赞扬Linux的许多特性，以及它强大、可靠、免费和开放。然而，尽管有这些积极的特性，Linux本身仍然只是一个基于文本的系统。没有漂亮的桌面，也没有窗口或迷人的小图标让你在键盘后面感到安全和舒适。尽管它可能很强大，但Linux仍然是一个严格的基于黑色屏幕、命令行驱动的操作系统。我想你可以把它看作是增强版的DOS，尽管Linux纯主义者可能会对这种想法感到不适。抱歉。
- en: Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing
    commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is
    used as a server), you don't have to do that. It is fair to say that with the
    advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,
    pronounced "goo-ee"), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They
    began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which
    gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.

- en: Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go graphical.
    The community at large developed various GUIs (called *window managers* and *desktop
    environments*) and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly

    as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux
    mascot, and what has come to be thought of as *the* Linux penguin was designed
    by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see [Figure 1-1](ch01s02.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot
    "Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot")). This explains not only the ornithological
    references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin
    icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include *penguin* or *Tux*,
    such as TuxRacer, XPenguins, and Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux
    is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to
    as *Penguinistas*. True, Ubuntu doesn't play up the penguin as much as other distributions,
    but Linux is Linux, and so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too . . . just a bit less
    conspicuously.

    "Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot")). 这不仅解释了书中贯穿的鸟类的引用和图形，还解释了为什么Linux发行版中有如此多的企鹅图标，以及许多包含*企鹅*或*Tux*的程序，如TuxRacer、XPenguins和Pingus。这一点，加上Linux是一个革命性的操作系统的事实，有助于解释为什么Linux用户有时被称为*企鹅主义者*。诚然，Ubuntu并没有像其他发行版那样过分强调企鹅，但Linux就是Linux，所以企鹅也生活在Ubuntu中……只是不那么显眼。
