    world of Linux. If you have already made the commitment and have Ubuntu installed
    on your machine, you are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have made
    the commitment psychologically but have yet to act on that commitment. And some
    of you are probably reading these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering
    about Linux and about whether you should spend your money on this book or on a
    latté every morning for the next couple of weeks. For those in this last group,
    I can only say, "Get this book." Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.

    Ubuntu thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and what
    you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions along
    the way and, if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by the time
    you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, your doubts will
    be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. Anyway, until
    you are ready to make the commitment, you can still follow along, because the
    CD that comes with this book contains, in addition to the Ubuntu installer, a
    live Ubuntu environment—meaning that you can get a taste of the Ubuntu Linux experience
    without having to even touch what you have on your hard drive. You can kick back,
    put your worries in check, and go with the flow.

    really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own,
    it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. For it
    to do anything truly useful, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The
    OS takes a well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine and educates
    it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You already know of and have probably used at least one of the many operating
    systems that exist today, or did in the past. Windows, DOS, OS/2, and Mac OS are
    all such operating systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different
    from these other operating systems, in terms of both its capabilities and its
    heritage. Linux was not created by a corporation or by some corporate wanna-be
    out to make money. The Linux core, referred to as the *kernel*, was created by
    computer enthusiast Linus Torvalds, a member of Finland's Swedish ethnic minority,
    who wanted to create a Unix-like system that would work on home computers—particularly
    his.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds opened it up to the world,
    so to speak, and compu-geeks around the globe worked to make it better and more
    powerful. It is this combination of applications built around the core of the
    Linux kernel that is the essence of all Linux distributions today.

    devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for being robust, reliable,
    free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux is, on
    its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there are no
    windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you are
    behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a black-screen,
    command line–driven operating system. I guess you could think of it as DOS on
    steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought. Sorry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing
    commands on a black screen (the most common way of doing things when Linux is
    used as a server), you don't have to do that. It is fair to say that with the
    advent in 1984 of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,
    pronounced "goo-ee"), DOS users began suffering something akin to GUI envy. They
    began clamoring for a GUI to call their own. The final result was Windows, which
    gave DOS a GUI and eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, many members of the Linux world felt the need and desire to go graphical.
    The community at large developed various GUIs (called *window managers* and *desktop
    environments*) and a subsystem with which to handle them (somewhat confusingly
    referred to as the *X Window System*) to bring about the change. The graphical
    desktop environment that is included in your Ubuntu distribution—GNOME—is one
    example of the fruit of that development.

    as well explain that now. The penguin was chosen by Linus Torvalds as the Linux
    mascot, and what has come to be thought of as *the* Linux penguin was designed
    by Larry Ewing and is named Tux (see [Figure 1-1](ch01s02.html#tux_comma_the_linux_mascot
    "Figure 1-1. Tux, the Linux mascot")). This explains not only the ornithological
    references and graphics throughout the book but also why there are so many penguin
    icons in Linux distributions and so many programs that include *penguin* or *Tux*,
    such as TuxRacer, XPenguins, and Pingus. This, combined with the fact that Linux
    is a revolutionary OS, helps explain why Linux users are sometimes referred to
    as *Penguinistas*. True, Ubuntu doesn't play up the penguin as much as other distributions,
    but Linux is Linux, and so the penguin lives in Ubuntu too . . . just a bit less
    conspicuously.

    it is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make a list in

    oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these days are limited
    in some way, or they let you use them only for a short time unless you are willing
    to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, but $25 here and $35 there
    eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of change. There is also the problem
    that some of these programs, unbeknownst to you, install backdoors or keyloggers
    or make your system a sudden garden of adware. Finally, at least in my experience,
    the majority of such programs are hardly worth the money asked.

    functions. And because there is no Linux corporation to package and distribute
    the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in
    working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen
    to a varied group of entities—companies, universities, user groups, and even private
    individuals. These entities create Linux system and application collections called
    *distributions*, or *distros*. You could bypass such distros and try to collect
    everything you'd need to set up a system all on your own, but you would undoubtedly
    lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt for the distros.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Most of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, basically consist
    of the same main elements: the core operating system (that''s the Linux kernel
    I mentioned earlier); some sort of installer program to get all the system parts
    and applications properly installed on your machine; the X Window System to provide
    graphical interface support; one or more graphical desktop environments; and a
    series of applications, such as word processors, audio players, and games; as
    well as all the files needed to make these things work.'

    audiences, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, programmers, system
    administrators, and specific language users. What makes each distro different
    is the software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other convenience
    features such as the package (or application) installation mechanism and the installer
    for the system itself. Some distros are especially appropriate for home users
    because of their ease of installation. Ubuntu, a relative newcomer to the Linux
    world, is one of these, joining other distros that have long been popular in the
    ease-of-use arena, such as Mandriva, SUSE, and Fedora Core. Although some of these
    entities charge for their distros, most also provide them free for download.

    version. Check [Appendix B](apb.html "Appendix B. UBUNTU DESKTOP CDS FOR AMD64,
    OPTERON, OR INTEL CORE 2 USERS") for information on how to get it. The information
    provided there will also be of use to i386 users who happen to lose or damage
    the disc that comes with this book.

- en: Those of you with pre–Intel era PowerPC Macs (such as those with G3, G4, and
    G5 processors) may be aware that previous Ubuntu releases have been available
    in PowerPC versions. Unfortunately, as of the Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn release,
    this is no longer the case. This means that if you are a PowerPC Mac user, you
    will have to use one of the older Ubuntu releases or use an unofficial, community-supported
    release of Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx (more on that name in the following section)
    for PowerPCs ([http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/)).

- en: 'It''s worth noting that you are bound to come across a lot of weird phrases
    when dealing with Ubuntu, especially when searching for information on the Net.
    In particular, I am referring to seemingly incongruous phrases, such as *Warty
    Warthog*, *Hoary Hedgehog*, *Breezy Badger*, *Dapper Drake*, *Edgy Eft*, *Feisty
    Fawn*, *Gutsy Gibbon*, *Hardy Heron*, *Intrepid Ibex*, *Jaunty Jackalope*, and
    *Karmic Koala*. These are the unlikely code names of each of the releases of Ubuntu
    since its first appearance in 2004\. The important one for you to remember is
    that of the current release, which is the one on the book''s disc: version 10.04,
    known as *Lucid Lynx*.'

    These are Kubuntu, a KDE-based version of Ubuntu; Edubuntu, a special version
    of Ubuntu designed for use in the classroom; Xubuntu, a lightweight version of
    Ubuntu based on the XFCE desktop; and Ubuntu Studio, a new flavor of Ubuntu, aimed
    at "creative people," which contains a strong suite of graphics, video, and music
    applications. There's even a slimmed-down version of Ubuntu, called Ubuntu Netbook
    Edition, designed specifically for netbooks.

    disc in hand, it's time to get down to it. If you have already installed Ubuntu
    on your machine, just flip ahead to [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. A NEW PLACE
    TO CALL HOME"). If your machine is still Linuxless, though, it's time to take
    it out for a spin and see whether you like it. So for now, strap yourself down
    in front of that computer, clip on your spurs, and go straight to the next chapter.
    It's time to become a Penguinista!
