    solid color fills, and as such, gradients are one of the most important features
    of vector graphics. Designers can create amazingly complex and photorealistic
    art using nothing but carefully laid out gradients. For all their versatility,
    gradients are relatively simple to create and edit, render quickly, and are almost
    universally supported in SVG software—none of which is quite true, for example,
    for SVG filters such as blur (**[17.1 Blur](ch17s01.html "17.1 Blur")**).

    also includes a level of opacity; this means that you can, for example, make a
    gradient from opaque red to transparent red, with semitransparent red shades in
    between. SVG supports two types of gradients: *linear* (along a line) and *elliptic*,
    or *radial* (away from a center, with possibly unequal *axes* and a noncentral
    *focus point*).'

    way to address this need is by using a mask (**[18.4 Clipping and Masking](ch18s04.html

    the object is a solid color, an overlay object—a *shader*—of the same color as

    perceived gradient profile drastically, making its edges a lot smoother and more
