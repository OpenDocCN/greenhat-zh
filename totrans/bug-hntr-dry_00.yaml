- en: Welcome to *A Bug Hunter’s Diary*. This book describes the life cycles of seven
    interesting, real-life software security vulnerabilities I found over the past
    several years. Each chapter focuses on one bug. I’ll explain how I found the bug,
    the steps I took to exploit it, and how the vendor eventually patched it.

- en: The primary goal of this book is to provide you with practical exposure to the
    world of bug hunting. After reading this book, you will have a better understanding
    of the approaches that bug hunters use to find security vulnerabilities, how they
    create proof-of-concept code to test the vulnerabilities, and how they can report
    vulnerabilities to the vendor.

    bugs. I think they deserve it.

    with the different aspects of hunting, exploiting, and reporting software vulnerabilities.
    If you are an already-experienced bug hunter, this book will offer a new perspective
    on familiar challenges and will likely make you chuckle at times—or put a knowing
    smile on your face.

- en: The goal of this book is to teach readers how to identify, protect against,
    and mitigate software security vulnerabilities. Understanding the techniques used
    to find and exploit vulnerabilities is necessary to thoroughly grasp the underlying
    problems and appropriate mitigation techniques. Since 2007, it is no longer legal
    to create or distribute “hacking tools” in Germany, my home country. Such tools
    include simple port scanners as well as working exploits. Therefore, to comply
    with the law, no full working exploit code is provided in this book. The examples
    simply show the steps used to gain control of the execution flow (the instruction
    pointer or program counter control) of a vulnerable program.
