  <h1><span class="chapter">Chapter 10 -</span><br/>
  More Hardware Projects</h1>

  <p>The similarity of the Xbox to the PC architecture allows hackers to borrow <span style="font-size: 1em;">technology and expertise from the PC world when building hardware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">projects. As a result, PC hardware, monitors, cables, and peripherals have all been adapted to work with the Xbox. This chapter introduces some of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">these hardware projects, discovered, documented and implemented by</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hackers around the world.</span></p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_74"><b class="calibre3">The LPC Interface</b></h2>

  <p>Version 1.0 of the LPC (Low Pin Count) interface was defined by Intel in <span style="font-size: 1em;">1997. The LPC interface is a royalty-free bus that is designed to enable</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">systems without explicit ISA or X-bus (ISA-like expansion bus for memory</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">or generic I/O devices) capabilities. The need for the LPC interface stems</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">from the large number of low bit-rate, high pin count devices and busses</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with incompatible interfaces found in a standard PC, such as the floppy</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">disk, keyboard, mouse, serial, IrDA, parallel, ISA, and boot ROM interfaces.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">The aggregate bandwidth consumed by all these devices is small, but the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">number of signals required to support all of them easily exceeds the signal count required by higher-bandwidth buses such as the PCI or AGP bus.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Making matters worse, not all configurations of computers requires all of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">these legacy I/O devices, and wasted pins and functions just eat away at</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">profits. The cost of a pin on a chip package is high relative to the cost of the silicon required to support these simple interfaces. (A rule of thumb is that one package pin costs a penny, while in 0.13µ silicon, about ten thousand gates — enough logic to implement a small processor—costs a penny in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">silicon area, assuming the design is not bond-pad limited<sup>1</sup>.)</span></p>

  <p>The LPC interface counters this problem with a single, low-pin count (seven required pins, versus the 36 pins required for an ISA bus) bus that operates <span style="font-size: 1em;">at a high speed. All of the legacy I/O and expansion functions are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">mapped into this high-bandwidth bus, enabling system designers to create</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">so-called “Super I/O” chips that in turn enable Southbridge chips with a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">much lower pin count. In addition, segregating functions between Super</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">I/O chips and Southbridge chips allows designers to choose Super I/O</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and Southbridge chip combinations that provide the optimal set of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">features for a given application.</span></p>

  <p>The LPC physical interface is quite simple. The interface is a 4-bit bi-<span style="font-size: 1em;">directional bus that runs at a 33 MHz clock rate. The interface also has two</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“sideband” signals: one framing signal that indicates the start and end of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">LPC bus cycles, and one reset signal that forces al LPC peripheral devices into a known state for initialization purposes. In addition, there are a couple of optional signals for the LPC interface that provide DMA and interrupt capabilities as wel as power management for more sophisticated I/O</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">devices. (More information on the LPC bus and its protocol can be found in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Intel Low Pin Count (LPC) Interface Specification, version 1.1. The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">specification can be found on the Intel corporate website at http://</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">www.intel.com/design/chipsets/industry/lpc.htm.)</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_75"><b class="calibre3">LPC Interface on the Xbox</b></h3>

  <p>The Xbox incorporates an LPC interface on the motherboard. The LPC <span style="font-size: 1em;">interface in this case is used to implement a debug and test bus. One can</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">connect a keyboard and mouse through this LPC interface, as well as an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">alternate boot ROM for diagnostic purposes. The LPC interface is activated</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to load alternate boot code when the FLASH ROM on the Xbox is not</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">available. The lack of a FLASH ROM device can be simulated by forcing the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">lowest data bit (D0) of the FLASH ROM data bus to a level of zero volts.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Many speculate that the LPC interface is an essential part of the Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">production line because of the alternate boot ROM ability provided by the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">LPC interface. Fully assembled Xboxes can be configured with a comprehen</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">sive self-test program via the LPC interface. Applying the CPU as a fast test controller allows defective units to be quickly and efficiently isolated on the factory floor without the cost of expensive testing machines.</span></p>

  <p>For hackers, the alternate boot ROM facility provided by the LPC interface is an ideal mechanism for getting code into the Xbox. Valid LPC-loadable <span style="font-size: 1em;">boot ROM images for the Xbox can be created by anyone since the crypto</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">graphically secured boot procedure of the Xbox is now fully understood. In</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">fact, some vendors of alternate boot ROM devices for the Xbox have</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">leveraged the regularity of the LPC interface’s pinout geometry on the Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">motherboard to create ROM devices that instal without any soldering.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">These devices use a set of spring-loaded “pogo-pins,” similar to those used during production for Xbox testing, to contact the LPC interface with just a pressure-fit. (The pinout of the LPC bus as implemented on the Xbox can be found in Appendix F, “Xbox Hardware Reference.”)</span></p>

  <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_76"><b class="calibre3">Using the LPC Interface</b></h3>

  <p>The fact that the LPC interface is an industry standard is quite convenient for Xbox hardware hackers. First, there is a plethora of LPC-compatible <span style="font-size: 1em;">interface devices, ranging from Super-I/O chips to firmware ROMs with</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">built-in LPC interfaces. Second, the wide acceptance of the LPC interface as a diagnostic and convenience bus for generic PCs helps mitigate the legal risk of using the LPC interface and selling LPC interface devices. A firmware ROM for the LPC interface can be sold without any Xbox-specific contents</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">since end-users can easily reprogram their LPC bus devices using a simple,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">cheap adapter for their PC. A further help to the legality of LPC firmware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">devices is that the Xbox’s LPC connector pinout is nearly identical to the one recommended by Intel for generic PCs. As a result, an LPC firmware device sold for the Xbox is very similar to an LPC firmware device sold for the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">standard PC.</span></p>

  <p>One of the first LPC boot ROM devices was developed by Andy Green. <span style="font-size: 1em;">The project is called “Cheapmod” and it is an SST 49LF020 device (256</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">kByte FLASH ROM with an integrated LPC interface) in a socket wired to an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">LPC-compatible header. According to Andy’s Cheapmod webpage,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">“http://warmcat.com/milksop/cheapmod.html,” “If you can get</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ahold of the $2.50 SST 49LF020, you can build an alternative BIOS for $4.”</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">This device can be programmed using his “CheapLPC” programmer</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">(http://warmcat.com/milksop/cheapLPC.html), a delightfully</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">simple PC parallel-port based device that can (slowly) talk to and reprogram an LPC device. Many commercially available alternate firmware devices have</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">been based off of or inspired by his design, including the Xodus/Matrix</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">design. The Xodus/Matrix is a particularly interesting variant of Andy’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">original design, as it was the first Xbox alternate firmware device to implement an entirely solderless installation procedure. This opened up the world of Xbox hacking to software-oriented hackers who were not inclined to solder wires into their Xboxes. (A photograph of the Xodus/Matrix can be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">seen in Figure 10-1.) The Xodus/Matrix device comes without any code</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">programmed in it; the user must provide the alternate firmware image.</span></p>

  <p>There are some important functional considerations when selecting a <span style="font-size: 1em;">FLASH ROM chip with an LPC interface for use with the Xbox. The most</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">significant is that the native Xbox architecture allocates a 16 MB area for the boot ROM. If the physical boot ROM is smaller than 16 MB in size, the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">boot ROM contents are aliased to fill up the entire 16 MB space. This gives Xbox designers more flexibility in choosing the size of the ROM chip</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">without causing problems with routines that uses both bottom- and top-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">relative addressing.</span></p>

  <p><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-172_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="caption"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Figure 10-1</b><span style="font-size: 1em;">: The solderless Xodus/Matrix alternate firmware device, showing the spring-loaded “pogo-pin” contacts that enable a solderless connection to the LPC connector on the Xbox motherboard.</span><br/></p>

  <p>Let’s make the concept of bottom- and top-relative addressing more <span style="font-size: 1em;">concrete with an example. The addresses for the 16 MB boot ROM area in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Xbox spans from 0xFF00.0000 to 0xFFFF.FFFF. Programs on the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox that use bottom-relative addressing will compute addresses using</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">0xFF00.0000 + offset (bottom address plus offset), while programs</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">that use top-relative addressing will use 0xFFFF.FFFF – offset (top</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">address minus offset). Suppose a 1 MB boot ROM is installed in the Xbox.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">This means that the processor will see 16 identical copies of this 1 MB ROM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">spread evenly over the 16 MB ROM address space. In other words, the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contents of the boot memory appear identical for every address A +</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">0xFF00.0000 + n * 0x0010.0000, n = 0 through 15, A = 0</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">through 0x000F.FFFF. As a result, programmers can pack data into the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">smaller 1 MB boot ROM using both top- and bottom-relative addressing</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">without having to change any of their code: A valid copy of the ROM image</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">appears near both the top- and the bottom-relative base addresses. Now,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">suppose that Microsoft decided to save on cost and shrink their 1 MB boot</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ROM down to a 256 kB boot ROM. The processor now sees 64 identical</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">copies of this 256 kB boot ROM distributed over the 16 MB ROM address</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">space, and all of the old code that uses bottom- and top-relative addressing still works. Significantly, the CPU in the Xbox is hard-wired to start</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">executing code on power-up from an address located 16 bytes from the top</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of memory (its “reset vector”), while the hardware initialization routines wired into the Xbox chipsets use ROM locations located near the bottom</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of the 16 MB FLASH ROM space. As a result, the Xbox hardware</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em;">requires</i> <span style="font-size: 1em;">an LPC ROM implementation that is either 16 MB in size, or else aliases a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">smaller ROM’s contents throughout the FLASH ROM address space. (The</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">SST 49LF020 is one of the few LPC FLASH ROMs that aliases the ROM’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">contents over the whole address space. Arguably, this feature is actually a bug: By ignoring the upper address bits and aliasing the ROM’s contents</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">over the whole address space, this chip occupies space that could be allocated to other functions. As a result, SST has released an updated “A-step” of the part, called the 49LF020A, that does not alias the ROM’s contents over memory. Likewise, the A-step silicon will not work as an alternate firmware device for the Xbox.)</span></p>

    <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_77"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Alternate Firmware Devices vs.</b> <b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Modchips</b></h2>

    <p>An alternate firmware device is a hardware module that <span style="font-size: 1em;">provides a method for running user-specified firmware on</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the Xbox hardware. Alternate firmware devices are distin</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">guished from the so-called “modchip” in that an alternate</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">firmware device is furnished as a blank device and has no</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">inherent ability to circumvent copyright control mecha</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">nisms. A blank LPC-interface ROM device, for example, is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">an alternate firmware device: you could burn a copy of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the U.S. Bill of Rights on it if you wanted. Any user-installed</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">FLASH ROM that comes blank is also an alternate firmware</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">device. A modchip, on the other hand, colloquially implies</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">a device that is crafted for playing game backups and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">otherwise modifying or removing DRM (digital rights man</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">agement) policy restrictions. Hence, the term modchip en</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">compasses certain boot ROM devices that have been pro</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">grammed with code that enables DRM policy modifica</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">tions, as well as devices such as “patchers” that contain no</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ROM and operate by dynamically patching a few key</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox firmware locations as the firmware is loaded for ex</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ecution.</span></p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_78"><b class="calibre3">The Other 64 MB of SDRAM</b></h2>

  <p>An astute observer will note that there are two missing chips on the top <span style="font-size: 1em;">side of the Xbox motherboard, and that these missing chip spots look</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">suspiciously like the spots currently occupied by memory chips. Flip the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">board over, and there are two more unoccupied chip footprints. These</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">empty footprints are in fact for memory chips. The location of these blank</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">spots is shown in Figure 10-2.</span></p>

  <p><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-174_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 10-2</b>: The unpopulated memory footprints on the Xbox motherboard.</p>

  <div class="infobox">
    <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_79"><b class="calibre3">Fiduciaries</b></h2>

    <p>Look at an unpopulated memory spot on the Xbox <span style="font-size: 1em;">motherboard. The silver dot surrounded by a dark annulus</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">inside these unpopulated chip footprints is called a fidu</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ciary. Fiduciary patterns are used by circuit board assem</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">bly machines as reference points for aligning large chips</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with many pins. They are designed to be easily recognized</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">by the machine vision systems employed in board assem</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">bly machines. Specially shaped fiduciaries can also be used</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">to enable automatic identification of the orientation and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">type of a circuit board.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The next logical question is, of course, “Can you double the Xbox’s <span style="font-size: 1em;">memory size to 128 MB by soldering suitable memory chips into the open</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">slots on the Xbox motherboard?” The answer is in fact yes, but the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">initialization code for the Xbox needs to be modified in order for the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">chipset to recognize and use the extra memory. In addition, the extra</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">memory does not help graphics or gaming performance. Xbox games are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">not designed to take advantage of the extra memory, so the extra memory</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">will typically sit around unused. The extra memory spots are provided</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">primarily for the manufacture of special consoles for game developers.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Game developers can use the extra memory to ease the transition of games</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">into the Xbox’s relatively tight memory footprint, as well as for keeping</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">debug, performance monitoring, and test utilities resident in memory that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">are not part of the game image. Note that the extra memory could be</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">leveraged by home-brew software, but the difficulty of obtaining and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">installing the memory chips makes Xbox memory expansions more of an</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">interesting soldering practice exercise than a practical modification.</span></p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_80"><b class="calibre3">Xbox VGA</b></h2>

  <p>There is a little bit of confusion about what an Xbox VGA adapter does. <span style="font-size: 1em;">Many Xbox VGA adapters are actually TV-to-VGA converters. In other</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">words, they take the low resolution TV output from the Xbox and run it</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">through a line doubler to yield a low-quality VGA display. A true Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">VGA adapter actually configures the Xbox to output a much higher</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">resolution video output, yielding a better-than-TV quality display on a VGA monitor.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The VGA adapter configures the Xbox graphics mode using designated</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">pins in the AVIP (Audio Video I/O Port) connector. The main problem</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">with this approach is that a game has to be specially written to support this higher resolution mode. As a result, some games will not work with a true</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox VGA adapter, but fortunately going back to TV resolution is as easy</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as plugging in the standard TV adapter cable.</span></p>

  <p>The original Xbox-VGA adapter was developed by Ken Gasper. He sells a <span style="font-size: 1em;">version of it on his website at http://xboxvga.xemulation.com.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Currently, he offers the Xbox-VGA adapter in a “bare board” form as well</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as in a fully assembled form. If you are looking for an interesting hardware hacking project for the Xbox that is both useful and will hone your circuit assembly skills, it may be worth purchasing one of his bare boards and attempting to assemble the adapter yourself.</span></p>

  <p>Appendix F contains a pin diagram of the Xbox AVIP.</p>

  <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_81"><b class="calibre3" style="font-size: 1em;">Mass Storage Replacement</b><br/></h2>

  <p>The Xbox contains a DVD-ROM drive and a hard drive, both of which <span style="font-size: 1em;">use the PC standard IDE interface for talking to the Xbox motherboard.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">The DVD-ROM drive also has a proprietary power and DVD tray state</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">connector. A popular and sometimes necessary hacking activity for the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Xbox is replacing these drives.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Users replace or tweak the DVD-ROM because the native Xbox DVD-ROM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive is unable to read CD-Rs and many types of CD-RW media. This can</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">be particularly annoying for those who are trying to install Xbox-Linux for the first time, or for users who are trying to rip music from their CD-R</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">collection to the Xbox hard drive.</span></p>

  <p>There are many methods for replacing and tweaking the Xbox DVD-ROM <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive. Some Xbox DVD-ROM drive models can have their laser intensity</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">adjusted to improve their ability to read CD-R and CD-RW media. This is a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">potentially risky operation, since you can permanently damage your DVD-</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ROM drive by improperly adjusting the power output of the laser, but</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">many hackers have reported that a properly executed procedure results in</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">better media compatibility. I suggest a web-search for the latest news and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">techniques since the style and model of DVD-ROM drive used in the Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">varies frequently. In addition, the Xbox DVD-ROM drive can be replaced</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">outright with a standard PC DVD-ROM. The problem with this method is</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">twofold. First, a regular PC DVD-ROM drive cannot read original Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">game disks due to physical security measures built into an Xbox game disk.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">Second, a PC DVD-ROM drive needs to be adapted to the custom DVD</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">power and traystate connector on the Xbox motherboard.</span></p>

  <p>The easiest, but ugliest,way is to install a standard PC DVD-ROM drive but <span style="font-size: 1em;">leave the Xbox DVD-ROM drive connected through its proprietary cable. In</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">this method, the gray IDE cable is connected to the standard PC DVD-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">ROM drive (set to slave mode through jumper configurations on the drive),</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">and power is stolen from the hard drive’s power connector using a standard</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">power splitter cable. The Xbox DVD-ROM drive remains in place, but with</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">its IDE connector empty and with the proprietary yellow power-and-tray-</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">state cable installed. The purpose of the Xbox DVD-ROM drive is to serve</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">as a dummy drive that is used to manually relay the state of the DVD drive</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">tray to the Xbox. In other words, the user needs to manually replicate the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">state of the standard PC DVD-ROM’s tray using the Xbox DVD-ROM’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">tray during a media change event.</span></p>

  <p>The exact procedure for operating an Xbox in this configuration varies <span style="font-size: 1em;">depending upon the particular PC DVD-ROM drive model and the nuances</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">of the Xbox hardware configuration, so again, I suggest a web-search for</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">the latest information. There are also some websites that describe how to</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">adapt select PC DVD-ROM drive models to work with the Xbox’s propri</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">etary tray state and power connector. A project like this is a good intermediate-level one for hackers who are basical y comfortable with soldering and</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">screwdrivers. The modifications performed on the standard DVD-ROM</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive allow the state of the standard drive’s DVD tray to be accurately</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">transmitted to the Xbox. They do not allow you to play original games,</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">however, unless the Xbox has been modified with additional hardware that</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">circumvents the security checks on the DVD ROM drive. Even without the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">ability to play games, this is still a useful technique for ferreting out Xbox-Linux installation problems and for enhancing the ability of the Xbox to rip your CD collection or to watch DVDs. (Note that returning the IDE</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">connector back to the Xbox DVD-ROM drive will restore the original</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">gaming functionality of the Xbox.)</span></p>

  <p>Xbox hard drives also need replacing from time to time. Serious <span style="font-size: 1em;">software developers for the Xbox find it advantageous to install a higher</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">capacity hard drive in the Xbox, and users with broken hard drives also</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">desire to replace their hard drives. Unfortunately, the OEM Xbox hard</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive contains copyrighted Microsoft programs. Xbox hard drives are</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">also protected with a firmware lockout, which makes installing a new</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hard drive with original gaming functionality rather challenging, especially in terms of legal issues. The firmware lockout is also unique to each hard</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive, preventing you from replacing your hard drive with a used Xbox</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">hard drive. However, if you only wish to run Xbox-Linux or other</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">homebrew programs and do not care about playing games, installing a</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">new hard drive in the Xbox is as easy and as legal as installing a hard</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">drive in any PC.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 1em;"><sup>1</sup> The circuits on a chip are typically surrounded by squares of</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">metal (“bond pads”) that are wired to the pins on the chip’s</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">packaging. A chip is said to be bond-pad limited when the</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">area required for the ring of bond pads exceeds the area</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">required by the circuitry inside the chip. The cost of excess pins</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">becomes even higher in the case that a chip is bond-pad</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;">limited.</span><br/></p>
