    Some people are very organized, placing every file in a logically named folder
    as soon as that file is saved for the first time. Then there are people like me,
    who save everything to the desktop until it is so full of junk that they can no
    longer make out the wallpaper, and only at that point do they start organizing
    in earnest (if placing all of those files in a single folder called *March17Cleanup*
    can be called organizing).

    pane temporarily. You can do this quite easily by clicking the little gray close
    button in the upper-right corner of the pane or by going to the **View** menu
    of a Nautilus window and then deselecting **Side Pane**. The check mark next to
    that entry will then disappear, as will the side pane. To get it back, just return
    to the **View** menu, and select **Side Pane** again. The check mark will then

    "Figure 7-3. Another way of showing and hiding the Nautilus side pane")). Dragging
    this ribbed section allows you to resize the width of the pane. What most folks
    don't realize straight off, however, is that simply clicking that ribbed section
    acts as a toggle to hide or show the side pane. When the pane is hidden in this
    way, the ribbed section still appears at the left border of the window, which
    is not true when the pane is hidden in one of the ways mentioned earlier.

    it. The easiest (in my opinion) is to right-click any empty space within a Nautilus
    window, and select **Create Folder** in the pop-up menu that appears. If you prefer
    using menus over right-clicking empty space, you can instead start things rolling
    by selecting **File** ▸ **Create Folder**.

    or do other than that. Press **enter**, or click any open space in the Nautilus
    window to complete the job.

    highlight it and then select **Edit** ▸ **Rename**. After that, you can type the
    new name for the folder and then press **enter**, or you can click any open space
    in the Nautilus window to seal the deal.

    **Paste**. Keystroke-wise, that would be **ctrl**-C to copy and, as before, **ctrl**-V
    to paste.
  prefs: []

    though this involves more hands than required for a simple drag-and-drop move;
    fortunately, the two you have will do nicely. Just press and hold the **ctrl**
    key while you drag the file or folder you want to copy to the target location.
    Be sure to release the mouse button and then the **ctrl** key (releasing in the
    opposite order will not work), and you will find a copy of the file in its new
    location.

    actually is in the scheme of things, just in case you manage to get yourself really
    lost someday. To understand this, you should have a basic understanding of the
    Linux filesystem that, as you will find, is a bit different from what you were
    accustomed to in your previous operating system.
  prefs: []

    or, to put it into words, the home folder within root. If your user account were
    to have the same name as mine, *rg*, the path to that folder would be */home/rg*,
    or the *rg* folder within *home* within root. Whatever the name of your user account
    or the names of any other accounts you have on your machine happen to be, just
    remember that when you are lost, your folder, and those for all the other folks

    that are required by your system or applications installed on it. These libraries

    You can also narrow things down to a particular folder on the machine, as long

    `smb://cowboycats/mewtoyou/Documents`, for example. If you prefer, you can type

    in order to help you understand, I will give you some examples of how it can be
    useful. Let's say you have some files that you don't want your spouse or kids
    to see—some bad poetry or a Christmas shopping list, for example. By denying read
    permission to those files or to a folder containing those files, no one would
    be able to sneak a peek unless they were savvy at changing permissions and had
    the permissions necessary to change permissions for those files or folders.
  prefs: []

- en: As another example, imagine you have a file that you have worked many hours
    on and have finally completed. To alleviate fears that you might accidentally
    ruin that file in some way, you could deny yourself write permissions. By doing
    this, you wouldn't be able to save any changes you make to that file. You would
    be given the Save As option, but if you wanted to change the file itself, you
    would have to change the permissions. When you place such restrictions on a file
    or folder, a lock emblem appears on the icon for it, as shown in [Figure 7-8](ch07s06.html#nautilus_tells_you_when_permissions_rest
    "Figure 7-8. Nautilus tells you when permissions restrict your freedom of movement.").

    files from CD to your hard disk. In this case, the files will be write protected,
    meaning you cannot alter the files until you change the permissions for them.
    You can change the permissions of such files in order to allow yourself to alter

    Thus, if you move one of the files from its original location before burning the
    contents of the CD/DVD Creator window to disc, the link won't work any more and
    the file won't be copied onto the disc. This isn't too much of a problem, since

    an image of a CD's file contents, which means that it is the CD minus the media
    itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the ISO would be the soul of
    a CD; take away the CD's metal and plastic, and the remaining data would be an

    I have an external USB hard disk that does the trick, but you can use a USB flash

    your backups on the same computer, though. The best policy is to put some distance
    between the original files and the backups, so if there's a fire or some other
    disaster, you'll have at least one copy of them left intact. Make sure you have
    enough space for the backup too; regular CDs are only 700MB, but my *Pictures*
    folder alone weighs in at a whopping 4.3GB!

    files (and not more recent ones) if something does go wrong. I make a backup about
    once a month, but I should probably do it more regularly than that. It's not much
    of a chore; when you next use Déjà Dup, it'll remember all of your settings from
    the previous backup. If you want to do something different, click **Edit** ▸ **Preferences**
    in the main window, and change the options there. You'll find options for automatically
    backing up as well; check the *Automatically backup on a regular schedule* setting

    files, Tar. Compressed archives are great for two reasons: They let you bundle
    a load of files together into one handy package, and they also squeeze all the
