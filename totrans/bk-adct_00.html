    recorder, editor, and mixer for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It comes
    packaged in easy-to-use installers for Mac OS X and all versions of
    Windows, and Linux users will find it in the software repositories of
    their favorite Linux distributions. Visit <a class="ulink" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a> for downloads,
    documentation, and mailing lists.</p><p>In this book, we’ll be using Audacity 1.3.12 (and newer) on Ubuntu
    Studio and Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7. The stable 2.0
    release will appear soon and should look very much like what you see in
    this book because the 1.3.<span class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> series is the run-up to
    2.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. This book is based on the very latest releases
    as they came out, so it is as current as any book can be. The
    1.3.<span class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> Audacity releases are considerably advanced
    from the old 1.2.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series. Every new release is full
    of wonderful improvements and bug fixes, so if you’re still using those
    old 1.2.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> versions, you should consider
    upgrading.</p><p>Ubuntu Studio is Ubuntu with a huge set of multimedia applications.
    It is 100 percent Ubuntu-compatible, and it uses the standard Ubuntu
    software repositories. You can download Ubuntu Studio or simply add the
    Ubuntu Studio packages and artwork to any Ubuntu installation. There are
    several excellent multimedia Linux distributions, which you can read about
    in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a>. You can
    use any Linux version you like; a few important system modifications you
    may need to make are covered in <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a>.</p><p>Windows requires some modifications too, which you’ll find in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 14</a>. Since Windows XP
    continues to hang on and refuses to enter retirement, you’ll find
    information for Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.</p><div class="sect1" title="What Can Audacity Do?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_can_audacity_do_question"/>What Can Audacity Do?</h1></div></div></div><p>Audacity is fast and easy to use. What can you do with it? A whole
      lot:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Work with a wide number of different audio file formats and
          encodings, including WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, AU, OKI, MAT4/5, Ogg
          Vorbis, WMA, M4A, and AC3.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Record live audio.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Convert legacy analog media to digital.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make movie soundtracks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Perform unlimited multichannel recording.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Edit and mix multiple tracks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Overdub.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use special effects of all kinds: wah-wah, change pitch and
          tempo, bass boost, echo, reverse, phaser, and more.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add graceful fades, both in and out.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Normalize volume levels.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fix defects such as hiss, static, pops, and hum.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Perform frequency analysis.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Write your own plug-ins for special effects.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Cut, copy, splice, and mix sounds together.</p></li></ul></div><p>Audacity can open and edit audio files faster than most other
      audio applications and has nearly unlimited undo and redo.</p><p>So, what can’t you do with Audacity? Audacity does not support the
      RealAudio format, and it does not support MIDI. While it is wonderful
      for making mono and stereo recordings, it is not quite as good at making
      multichannel surround sound recordings.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="What This Book Covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_this_book_covers"/>What This Book Covers</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, we’ll use Audacity in a number of (I hope) fun and
      useful audio projects. In <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a>, we’ll plug a microphone into
      a computer and learn the basics of recording, editing, playback, and
      Audacity controls. We’ll also learn some important digital audio
      terminology and concepts. If you are new to digital audio production or
      new to Audacity, you should go through this chapter first.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap">Chapter 2</a>,
      we’ll go into detail on audio gear, how to select it, how to connect it,
      and how not to spend too much money. The world of audio gear is vast and
      confusing, but this chapter sorts it all out for you.</p><p>If you’re like me and have a hoard of treasured vinyl LPs, 45s, or
      vintage 78s that you want both to enjoy and preserve, read <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD">Chapter 3</a> to learn how to
      copy them to your computer. From there, you can transfer them to CDs or
      export to MP3 or any other digital audio format you want. You can do the
      same with any kind of legacy media.</p><p>Audacity is a great program for recording live shows or for
      editing recordings of live shows made with portable recorders. <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Creating and Editing Live Tracks for CD">Chapter 4</a> shows you how to
      clean up and optimize your recordings for compact disc or
      DVD-Audio.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Authoring a Compilation CD">Chapter 5</a> goes into more
      detail on making audio CDs and compilation CDs. You’ll learn how to
      normalize different volume levels, break long files into separate
      tracks, transition smoothly between tracks, and edit track
      metadata.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Authoring Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs">Chapter 6</a>, we
      learn how to author super high-fidelity DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio is a
      special audio standard for DVDs; it is not the same as the audio formats
      used on movie DVDs. With DVD-Audio, you can author very high-fidelity
      DVDs or load several CDs’ worth of music onto a single DVD.</p><p>Podcasts are all the rage, and <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Creating Podcasts">Chapter 7</a> tells you how to make podcasts that sound
      good and are bandwidth-efficient, and it covers the basics of Internet
      streaming audio.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Becoming an Online Star">Chapter 8</a> goes into detail on
      making the highest-quality audio recordings for distribution and
      tailoring your releases for different types of distribution, such as
      Internet radio, downloadable formats, and CD. It also offers some
      guidance on finding distributors and other business basics.</p><p>Audacity handles multitrack recording capably, so <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Multitrack Recording">Chapter 9</a> shows you how to record multiple
      tracks, mix, dub, edit, and mixdown to your final mono, stereo, or
      multichannel surround release. You can play or sing along to an existing
      track, record as many tracks at once as your recording interface
      supports and your computer can handle, and mix separate recording
      sessions together.</p><p>Don’t pay for ringtones—study <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Making Your Own Ringtones">Chapter 10</a> to learn how to make your own
      easily. Ringtones need to be not too big and not too small, and they can
      be any snippet of music or sounds or even your own voice. Learn some
      tips for tailoring your ringtones to sound better on the tiny lo-fi
      speakers of your phone.</p><p>You can go nuts playing with special effects in Audacity—strange
      noises, sound effects, echo, wah-wah, bass boost, tremolo, and so on.
      <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects">Chapter 11</a> introduces you
      to a number of them, tells you where to get more, and shows how to learn
      to write your own.</p><p>In movies and television, ace crime techs take shredded audio
      remnants and create detailed, high-quality, beautiful recordings as they
      natter about their magic algorithms. It’s all hooey. But you can do a
      lot to clean up recordings afflicted with pops, hiss, and other defects,
      and <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Fix-its and Cleanups">Chapter 12</a> tells how.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a>
      details how to select a Linux distribution for audio production, how to
      configure it for best performance, and how to troubleshoot and fix
      common problems.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 14</a> covers
      the important tweaks Windows users need to make for quality audio
      recording.</p><p>Audacity is easy to use, but it has a number of options that may
      not make sense to anyone who isn’t already an audio engineer, so <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Customizing Audacity">Chapter 15</a> goes in-depth into customization and
      configuration.</p><p><a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Audio Hardware">Appendix A</a> is your hardware reference;
      you’ll find examples of audio hardware in several price ranges that work
      on both Linux and Windows.</p><p><a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Glossary">Appendix B</a> is a glossary of audio terminology
      written for real people; that is, people who are not physicists or audio
      engineers and who appreciate clear explanations in plain English.</p><p><a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. Seven Myths of Digital Audio">Appendix C</a> debunks popular
      but silly audio myths and saves you from some common—and
      expensive—mistakes.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Audacity is also available as a source tarball. What do you do
        with a source tarball? It contains Audacity’s source code in a
        compressed archive. You can install Audacity from source code if you
        want and customize the compile-time options, examine the code, modify
        it, or even modify and redistribute it. If you’re feeling adventurous
        and want to help debug daily builds, you can grab the newest Audacity
        version from Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and give it a
        test-drive.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Audacity vs. Ardour"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="audacity_vs._ardour"/>Audacity vs. Ardour</h1></div></div></div><p>Another popular audio recording application for Linux (and Mac OS
      X) is Ardour, which calls itself a digital audio workstation. Ardour
      aims to meet the needs of professionals and competes with the likes of
      ProTools, Nuendo, Pyramix, and other expensive commercial audio
      applications. It has a more sophisticated mixer than Audacity and some
      nice audio-for-video tools. It has advanced dubbing abilities,
      synchronizes with MIDI sequencers, and supports control surfaces, which
      are hardware devices for controlling your software mixers. It has more
      automation, as well as a number of useful real-time features such as
      changing plug-ins on the fly and moving samples to different tracks or
      timelines while they are playing.</p><p>Which one is better? That depends on what you want to do. Both are
      100 percent free software because they are licensed under the GPL, both
      are excellent, and both are getting better all the time. For complex
      multitrack mixing or precise video soundtrack synchronization, go with
      Ardour. For recording long tracks such as live shows, converting LPs and
      tapes to digital formats, cleaning up files marred by hiss or hum or
      other defects, making podcasts, making simple video soundtracks, and
      recording in the field, Audacity is an excellent, quality application
      with a short learning curve and a lot of useful and advanced
      features.</p></div></body></html>
