Well, you will be happy to know that using your device with your Ubuntu system is quite easy—easier than ever, in fact. No longer do you have to mess around with mount and unmount commands or edit system tables, and if you don’t know what I’m talking about, consider yourself lucky. Just plug in your device, and Ubuntu will do the rest.</p><div class="sect1" title="Knowing Your Limits"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="knowing_your_limits"/>Knowing Your Limits</h1></div></div></div><p>Assuming Ubuntu helped you to download and install all the audio codecs and support files for the applications mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Tux Rocks">Chapter 14</a>, you shouldn’t encounter any problems handling any of the media files on your digital media device. Even if you didn’t install those codecs and files, Ubuntu will automatically help you find the necessary items if you try to play a file it hasn’t already installed support for. Nevertheless, not all formats will work with equal degrees of comfort or success—it depends on your device and the file format’s compatibility with Ubuntu. As a general rule of thumb, most players will be able to handle MP3 files and unlocked AAC (<span class="emphasis"><em>.m4a</em></span>) files. Check your device’s manual for specifics about other file formats (or just give them a try).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0004"/></p><p>As far as Ubuntu goes, it can work with all the file formats mentioned—with the exception of locked AAC files.

Ubuntu will also place icons for your device and Documents in the Launcher.</p><p>In addition, two of those what-do-you-want-me-to-do-with-this-stuff types of displays will appear.

Most important of these is the device’s auto-updating settings. When you enable auto-update on your iPod or iPhone via iTunes, the function is set up within the device itself. You can use your iPod in Windows, Mac OS, or Linux—or all of them interchangeably. If you set up your iPod to auto-update songs and playlists, however, you are leaving yourself open for trouble unless you have exactly the same music collection on all of your machines.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0007"/></p><p>Here’s why: Although iTunes allows you to add files <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> your iPod, it does not allow you to copy files <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> it. The auto-update feature is thus strictly a one-way street. This means that whenever you hook up your auto-update-enabled iPod to an iTunes-enabled computer, iTunes will automatically add the tracks in its library to your iPod—so far, so good. More frighteningly, it will remove any tracks from your iPod that are not present in that machine’s iTunes library. I learned this the hard way when I took my now ex-wife’s loaded iPod to work and plugged it into my office Winbox with its completely empty iTunes library. When I brought the little Podster back home to her with nothing at all on it, well . . . what ensued wasn’t pretty.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0010"/></p><p>Make sure to disable your iPod’s auto-update function before bringing the device into the Linux world. To do this, connect your iPod to your Mac or Windows machine and open iTunes. In the left pane of the iTunes window, click your iPod in the Devices section, and then in the <span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span> tab in the right pane, check the box next to <span class="strong"><strong>Manually manage music</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>Manually manage music and videos</strong></span> in video-capable iPods), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#disabling_the_auto-update_function_on_yo" title="Figure 15-3. Disabling the auto-update function on your iPhone/iPod in iTunes">Figure 15-3</a>.

Fortunately, working with any Android-powered device in Ubuntu is quite simple, and it’s only slightly different from working with one of Apple’s “i” devices.

The reason was that these devices did not use the USB protocol that most of the other devices in this class use. Instead they used a file transfer protocol called MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) which was not Linux (or even Mac) friendly. The good news is that while these devices still use the MTP file transfer protocol, Linux, as of this Ubuntu 12.04 release, has no problems working with these devices. This means that all those connection and file transfer problems are gone, and your device should work with Ubuntu just like all the others mentioned in this chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0014"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Working with Other Digital Media Players and Cell Phones"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="working_with_other_digital_media_players"/>Working with Other Digital Media Players and Cell Phones</h1></div></div></div><p>Although the iPod may be the most popular digital media player out there and the iPhone holds the crown in the smartphone market, they are by no means the only games in town.

The simplest way to see how your device will work is to connect it to your computer via a USB cable. If windows asking you how to deal with the device do not appear, open a file manager window to see whether you find an icon for the device there. If so, you can work with your device using the tried-and-true drag-and-drop method. You can also use Rhythmbox to work with the audio files on your generic device by doing the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In Rhythmbox, go to the Music menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Check for New Devices</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If your device does not show up in the left pane, then import the folder on your device where the audio files are stored by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button above the main pane in the Rhythmbox window.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Import Folder into Library window that appears, click your device in the left pane.

Luckily, Rhythmbox allows you to do this easily.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0027"/></p><p>To copy music from your iPhone/iPod/iPad, Android-based phone, or other digital media device with Rhythmbox, select the tracks you want to export (hold down the <span class="keycap">ctrl</span> key to make multiple selections or use the tabs to select whole artists or genres if you like) and drag the selected items to your desktop, music folder, or wherever you want them. The only catch with this mostly simple approach is that when copying files from an iPod/iPhone, you end up with files on your hard disk with funky filenames, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>ZPAD.m4a</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>ATDT.mp3</em></span>, rather than the name that appeared on your iPhone/iPod or within Rhythmbox. This means you’ll have to rename the files once they have been transferred to your hard disk. This isn’t too much of a chore unless you’re dealing with lots and lots of files or if you’ve forgotten which file is which. In the latter case, right-click the file, click <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span> tab, where you will find the original filename (<a class="xref" href="ch15.html#finding_the_filename_properties_of_a_mis" title="Figure 15-6. Finding the filename properties of a mislabeled audio file">Figure 15-6</a>).

If this is the case, most likely your iPod is formatted in Apple’s native HFS+ filesystem—although this in itself is not a problem. The problem is that HFS+ formatted iPods have journaling enabled. <span class="emphasis"><em>Journaling</em></span> is an HFS+ feature that acts to protect the filesystem from damage due to power surges, power failures, or hardware breakdowns.</p><p>As fate would have it, however, the Linux kernel doesn’t deal well with journaling-enabled, HFS+ formatted devices. Fortunately, the tweak to fix this is quite simple, and it isn’t even particularly geeky: You just have to disable journaling on your iPod.</p><p>Disabling journaling on an HFS+ formatted iPod is easy if you have a Mac nearby. Just plug your iPod into a Mac, close iTunes when it automatically opens, and then run Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder).

Accepting that option is the easiest way to get the support you need to play such files within Ubuntu.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0039"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0040"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0043"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-15-0044"/></p><p>Once you accept, Ubuntu will search for the plug-in and necessary support files. Once Ubuntu finds them, it will show the result of its search in a new window. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to continue. When the process is complete, you will be able to play previously locked AAC files on your system. If Rhythmbox was running while the installation process was taking place, however, you will need to restart it before it will be able to handle the files.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Linux on Your iPod, iPad, or Android Device?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="linux_on_your_ipod_comma_ipad_comma_or_a"/>Linux on Your iPod, iPad, or Android Device?</h1></div></div></div><p>One thing you might notice if you do a Google search on using your Android or Apple “i” device with Linux is that it is possible to actually replace your iPod’s Apple-designed operating system with a form of Linux. Now, I’m not advocating that you do this (and I most certainly have not done so myself), but some folks are interested in geeking around with whatever gadget they have in their hands. If you’re such a person or if you’re just curious, check out the Linux on iPod site (<a class="ulink" href="http://ipodlinux.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">http://ipodlinux.sourceforge.net/index.shtml</a>) or the even more popular Rockbox (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.rockbox.org/">http://www.rockbox.org/</a>), which also runs on a number of non-Apple devices. You can also find information on installing Ubuntu on Android devices, for example at the Geeknizer site (<a class="ulink" href="http://geeknizer.com/install-run-ubuntu-on-android/">http://geeknizer.com/install-run-ubuntu-on-android/</a>).</p></div></div></body></html>
