If you’re anything like me, you’ll often find yourself working with people who use Windows, so it’s important to know how to make Ubuntu happily coexist with Microsoft’s ubiquitous OS. Fortunately, Linux is just about the most accommodating operating system available and has no problems sharing files, reading Windows disks, and so forth. In fact, your Ubuntu programs probably support a wider range of file formats than their Windows equivalents; on more than one occasion I’ve tried to open a file in Windows, failed, and then booted into Ubuntu where I could open it effortlessly.</p><p>Of course, sharing files with others may not be your only Windows-related worry, especially if you’re a dual-booter. Plenty of people decide to run both Windows and Linux on their computer, so it pays to know how you can minimize the bureaucracy involved in switching between the two. If you kept Windows for the sole purpose of running a specific application and you can’t find a Linux-compatible equivalent to it, perhaps you can save the effort of dual-booting altogether and simply install the program directly onto Ubuntu. I told you Linux was accommodating . . . it’ll even adopt Windows programs as its own!<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0005"/></p><p>Over the course of this chapter, you’ll learn how to make the most of your double operating system setup: You’ll install some Windows fonts, install some Windows programs, and share files on a Windows network. And if that isn’t quite enough Windows for you, you’ll even see how to run Windows (in a window!) in Ubuntu. You might want to sit in a dark room for this one—if you’re not tired of “windows” already, you will be by the end of the chapter!</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_19a_colon_accessing_files_on_you"/>Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</h1></div></div></div><p>If you decided to dual-boot with Windows when you installed Ubuntu, then you’ll have a partition lurking somewhere on your hard disk filled with your Windows files and programs (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Wading and Diving">Chapter 2</a> if you need a refresher on how partitions work). You can access files on Windows by <span class="emphasis"><em>mounting</em></span> the partition from within Ubuntu. When you mount a partition, the files are made available to you through Nautilus (and other programs)—mounting is just Linux’s way of recognizing a partition and preparing it for use.</p><div class="sect2" title="19A-1: Mounting Your Windows Partition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="a-1_colon_mounting_your_windows_partitio"/>19A-1: Mounting Your Windows Partition</h2></div></div></div><p>Mounting your Windows partition in Linux used to be a bit of a chore, but that isn’t the case anymore (at least not in Ubuntu). In fact, all you have to do is open a Nautilus window and click the Windows partition in the sidebar.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0006"/></p><p>You might find more than one hard disk icon in the sidebar, so it is possible that you won’t be sure which one your Windows partition actually is. Just remember that your Linux partition is represented by the hard disk icon named <span class="emphasis"><em>File System</em></span>, which is listed under the Computer section in the Nautilus sidebar. Things aren’t so simple for the Windows partition, unfortunately. It should be listed under Devices, rather than Computer, but it could be labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>OS</em></span> (as shown in the sidebar in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus" title="Figure 19-1. Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus">Figure 19-1</a>) or with the size of the partition followed by the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Media</em></span> (for example, if your Windows partition is 80GB in size, it might appear as <span class="emphasis"><em>80GB Media</em></span> in the sidebar). Or, it might be something else entirely. Guess which one it is, if necessary—it won’t hurt if you get it wrong.</p><div class="figure"><a id="mounting_a_windows_partition_in_nautilus"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject19_d1e19452"/><img alt="Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263990.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 19-1. Mounting a Windows partition in Nautilus</p></div><p>Now that you know which disk icon is which, it’s time to get it mounted!

Before you can unmount it yourself, you must first make sure that none of your programs are accessing files or folders on the partition. Nautilus and the Terminal are the usual suspects, so before unmounting, close any Nautilus or Terminal windows that are browsing that partition. Once you’ve done that, click the little eject icon next to the Windows partition in the sidebar of a Nautilus window (<a class="xref" href="ch19.html#the_windows_partition_losr_in_the_nautil" title="Figure 19-2. The Windows partition “OS” in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon">Figure 19-2</a>) or right-click the eject icon and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unmount</strong></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_windows_partition_losr_in_the_nautil"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject19_d1e19488"/><img alt="The Windows partition “OS” in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263992.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 19-2. The Windows partition “OS” in the Nautilus side pane, complete with eject icon</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Accessing a Linux Partition While Running Windows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="accessing_a_linux_partition_while_runnin"/>Accessing a Linux Partition While Running Windows</h1></div></div></div><p>Viewing your Windows files in Ubuntu isn’t too stressful, as you have just found out. But what about going the other way and getting Windows to recognize your Linux partition? Unfortunately, Windows isn’t too helpful in this respect—it can view only FAT or NTFS-format partitions and has no built-in support for the ext format normally used by Linux. As such, if you need access to your Linux files in Windows, it’s probably easiest to create a separate FAT partition to be shared by both operating systems (see <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. Manually Partitioning Your Hard Disk">Appendix C</a>). Hmm, not exactly convenient.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0011"/></p><p>An alternative is to add support for Linux partitions into Windows by installing some extra software. Unfortunately, the state of such software is pretty dire: Support for the old-fashioned ext2 format is pretty good, but Ubuntu uses ext4 nowadays, which is a different beast entirely. As far as I can tell, the best that people have managed to do is to get an ext4 partition mounted in Windows in read-only mode. Although you won’t be able to add new files to the partition, at least you’ll be able to see what’s in there and copy them into Windows. To try this for yourself, download Linux Reader from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/">http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/</a>. It seems pretty usable and has the distinct advantage of being free!</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Project 19B: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_19b_colon_installing_microsoft_w"/>Project 19B: Installing Microsoft Windows Core Fonts</h1></div></div></div><p>Like it or not, the computing world is still pretty much a Microsoft world, and that means the vast majority of users, even Mac users, are using Microsoft fonts. Thus, you will inevitably have to deal with documents using fonts such as Georgia, Verdana, Times New Roman, and Courier, to name a few. Of course, your system can substitute the fonts it has for those used in the document. But for you to see things precisely as they were intended and to allow others to see your documents the way you intended, it will behoove you to install those Microsoft core fonts on your own system.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0013"/></p><p>Fortunately, there are two ways to get these fonts. One is to download and install them via the Ubuntu Software Center, while the other, for those of you with a dual-boot setup, is to simply copy them from your Windows partition. In the former case, all you need to do is install the Microsoft Core Fonts package using the Ubuntu Software Center. To do this, search for <span class="emphasis"><em>mscorefonts</em></span> in the Software Center and install the Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts package (it should be the only result). Note that this is the older set of fonts from Windows XP, so installing this package won’t get you any of the swishy new fonts that are bundled with later Windows versions. Once the installation process is complete, your new Microsoft fonts will have been successfully installed and made ready for immediate use by every user account on your machine.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0014"/></p><p>If you’re a dual-booter, you can copy the fonts directly from your Windows installation. This has the advantage of getting all your Windows fonts into Ubuntu, even the newer ones (if you have Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 installed). Here’s what you need to do:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Mount your Windows partition, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#project_19a_colon_accessing_files_on_you" title="Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)">Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html#project_19a_colon_accessing_files_on_you" title="Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)">Project 19A: Accessing Files on Your Windows Partition (for Dual-Booters)</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Windows partition in Nautilus and browse to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows/Fonts</em></span> folder.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Now for a little trick: Select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Select Items Matching</strong></span>, type *<strong class="userinput"><code>.ttf</code></strong> in the box that appears, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch19.html#selecting_all_the_truetype_fonts_in_the" title="Figure 19-3. Selecting all the TrueType fonts in the Windows/Fonts folder">Figure 19-3</a>).

This is fine for people who want to use Ubuntu for almost everything but need to dip into Windows from time to time.

To make the change, you’ll first need to install a neat little app that goes by the name of Grub Customizer. Alas, it’s not yet available from the regular Ubuntu software repositories, but you can get it from a PPA instead without much fuss.

Despite there being Linux equivalents for most of the Windows programs that you need, you may miss one or two programs. Fortunately, it is possible to run some Windows applications from within Linux with the help of a program called Wine. Wine works by fooling applications into thinking they’re running on Windows. It does this by providing all of the libraries and support files that programs expect to find on Windows, without any need for Windows to actually be installed. The list of compatible software includes the likes of Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Adobe Photoshop, and a whole host of games, so if you’re desperately missing a particular program, then Wine is definitely worth a look.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0032"/></p><p>It is only fair to point out that Wine continues to be a work in progress.

The Wine website is full of tips on how to tweak settings until you hit on the magic formula that seems to work for a given program (settings that are practically guaranteed not to work for other programs you installed with Wine). Some instructions even ask you to install different versions of Wine for different programs! Fortunately, there’s a neat way to sidestep these issues called PlayOnLinux. It handles all the settings tweaks for you and supports many commonly used Windows programs (and an especially large number of games).

This simulation, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual machine (VM)</em></span> software, allows you to install one operating system inside another so you can run both at once without having to reboot. This is handy if you need to run Windows for some reason, perhaps for some specialized software, but are too comfortable working in Ubuntu to even contemplate going through the somewhat time-consuming rebooting procedure that dual-booters must follow to get back into Microsoft territory. You can even get Windows to sit there in, well, a window, which can be opened and closed at will just like any other program.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-19-0038"/></p><p>There are some caveats. First, the virtual machine has to share your computer’s resources with all your other programs, so it can slow things down if you’re doing anything computationally strenuous. Second, it doesn’t have the same access to your computer’s hardware as the “real” operating system, so you probably won’t be able to get Windows-only devices working through the virtual machine very easily. Finally, and perhaps most awkwardly, you need a Windows installation CD to be able to put Windows into a VM, but most computers only come supplied with a recovery CD, which won’t do the trick.</p><p>If you do have an installation CD, getting Windows into a VM doesn’t take much more work than getting it onto a real computer:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Ubuntu Software Center and install VirtualBox.

This can be a tough decision; on the one hand, you need enough memory for the “virtual” operating system to be able to run (Windows XP needs at least 128MB, for example), but on the other hand, you want to leave enough memory free for Ubuntu programs to be able to use it. VirtualBox normally suggests something sensible.</p><div class="figure"><a id="choosing_how_much_memory_to_allocate_to"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject19_d1e20060"/><img alt="Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1264012.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 19-12. Choosing how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> again and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Create new hard disk</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch19.html#creating_a_new_virtual_hard_disk" title="Figure 19-13. Creating a new virtual hard disk">Figure 19-13</a>).
