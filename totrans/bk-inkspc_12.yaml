    work on paths. We will start with the basics of SVG paths and the traditional
    path tools whose analogs you may have already seen in other software. Then, in
    the second half of this chapter and in the next one, we will look at the advanced
    Inkscape techniques for path editing that are often more efficient—and almost
    always a lot more fun to use. You may find, for example, the Tweak tool (**[12.6
    Path Tweaking](ch12s06.html "12.6 Path Tweaking")**) so easy and natural that
    you will rarely want to resort to the more technical and low-level Node tool (**[12.5
    The Node Tool](ch12s05.html "12.5 The Node Tool")**). Still, it is important that
    you know what a path consists of and are able, when necessary, to directly manipulate
    path nodes, as this is one of the cornerstones of vector graphics of any kind.

    ([Figure 12-1](ch12s01.html#path_equals_nodes_plus_segments "Figure 12-1. Path
    = nodes + segments")). Each node may have either one neighboring segment (if it’s
    an end node) or two (if it’s a middle node); SVG does not allow you to have branching
    paths with more than two segments joined at the same node.

    almost cusps; it may self-intersect or be perfectly straight when the handles
    are fully retracted (i.e., coincide with their nodes).

    reach with the next Bézier curve and where best to place the next node. Forcing
    a path to more closely approximate some real-life shape usually involves subdividing
    its Béziers by adding nodes and adjusting their handles. In contrast, simplifying
    a path, either manually or with the **Simplify** command (**[12.3 Simplifying](ch12s03.html

    corners, smoothing the intersections, and fusing together close brush strokes

    a few inset/outset cycles on it to make it appear more natural and worn-down,

    adjacent path segments as smooth as possible. If the adjacent nodes are also auto,
    their handles will also be adjusted accordingly. For example, when you move an
    auto node A closer to auto node B, both will make their handles progressively
    shorter and rotate them toward each other so as to keep the curvature of the segment
    between them, as well as the adjacent segments on both sides, as low as possible
    without breaking the smoothness of the nodes. The result of this behavior is reminiscent
    of the **Spiro Spline** path effect (**[13.1.7 Spiro Spline](ch13s01.html#one3dot1dot7_spiro_spline

    you can just click and hold while the path keeps bulging or retracting under your
    brush. However, you can just as well drag to chase the moving edge of the path;
    this way, using a small-sized brush, you can grow appendages and branches of any
    length out of a path. (Such growing can also be done in Push mode, but Grow is
    somewhat easier for this task.) Also, the Shrink mode can act as a quick eraser.
    Cutting through paths, evaporating small crumbs and bits, and trimming long brush
    strokes is very easy in this mode:'

    makes the edge crooked and uneven, while strong roughening tears and explodes
    the edge into random blobs and splotches.
