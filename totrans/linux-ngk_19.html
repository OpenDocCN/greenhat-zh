</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">We’ve just about come to the end of our  Linux adventure together. However, before  I cast you off on your own, there are a few  areas left that I should cover so as to round  out your total Linux knowledge base up to this  point. This chapter really consists of four parts: The first  deals with system settings, the second with KDE, the third  with keeping your system up to date, and the fourth with a  collection of odds and ends that just didn’t fit nicely  anywhere else but are important nevertheless. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Although we’ve already gone over most of what you need in terms of system settings  (thematic and printing preferences and the like), there are a couple of other areas  that warrant at least a little mention.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are the only person using your machine, you may be wondering why you  need to bother logging in every time you start up your machine. Well, actually  you don’t have to; it is possible to set things up so that the system will automatically log you in, thus bypassing the login screen. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To set things up this way, go to the Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Login Screen</b>. You will then be prompted for your root password, so type it and  click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. The Login Screen Setup window will appear (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU192">Figure 19-1</a>). </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the Login Screen Setup window, go down to the <b class="calibre13">Automatic login</b> section, and  check the <b class="calibre13">Login a user automatically on first bootup </b>checkbox. Then, in the  <b class="calibre13">Automatic login username</b> drop-down menu, select your username. Once you’ve  done that, click the <b class="calibre13">Close</b> button.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now, the next time you boot up your machine, you will bypass the login  screen and go directly to your desktop. Of course, if you need to get back to the  login screen for some reason or other (such as when switching into KDE, which I’ll discuss shortly, or switching into another language mode), you can still do so  by simply going to the Main menu and selecting<b class="calibre13"> Log Out</b>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="843" id="843"/><a name="IDX-264" id="IDX-264"/><i class="calibre11">Screen resolution</i>, to give you a very non-technical explanation, refers to the size of  everything that appears on your monitor. A high resolution (such as 1024 by  768) gives you more desktop area to work with, but it makes everything appear a  bit smaller. A low resolution (such as 640 by 480) makes everything bigger and easier to see, but it also gives you much less desktop space to work in. You may  also find that certain monitors just look better at certain resolutions than at  others. An LCD monitor that I just hooked up to one my machines looked really flat and blurry at 800 by 600, but when I changed it to 1024 by 768, it was  beautiful. You might want to experiment a bit with your screen resolution  settings if your screen doesn’t look as good as you think it should.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial"> The numbers, in case you were wondering, refer to the number of pixels (or dots) displayed in the screen’s width and height, respectively. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Changing your screen resolution is quite easy in Fedora. All you have to do is go to your Main menu and select <b class="calibre13">Preferences </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Screen Resolution</b>. The Screen Resolution Preferences window will open, and you can select the resolution you  want in the <b class="calibre13">Resolution</b> drop-down menu. It is also a good idea to check the specs  for your monitor to see if the resolution choice you make requires any change in  the refresh rate for your monitor. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have selected your preferred resolution, click <b class="calibre13">Apply</b>, and the  resolution will immediately change. A small window will open, asking whether  you want to return to the default resolution or keep the changes you’ve just made (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU193">Figure 19-2</a>). You can click whichever button meets your desires at the  moment.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<i class="calibre11">Color depth</i> refers to the number of colors displayed on your screen. The basic  color level is 256 colors; this is sometimes called 8-bit color, as the computer must  send eight bits of data to create one pixel on the screen. However, if you want to  view graphics, especially photos, a color depth of 256 colors will cause those  images to look muddy and blotchy. In this case, it is better to increase your color  depth to thousands of colors (called 16-bit color), which should be more than  enough. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You may be wondering why you shouldn’t just go wild and pick millions of  colors (32-bit color), which would be a logical enough way of looking at things — a sort of why-take-the-Bug-when-the-Cadillac-is-in-the-driveway view of things.  Well, to stick with the metaphor, the reason is gas mileage, so to speak. Basically, the more information you have to send to your screen, the more computing  power and memory you use, and that slows things down. Consequently, a  computer running a text-only, black-and-white system (a 1-bit system) would be  considerably faster than the same computer running an 8-bit color system, which  would be faster than 16-bit color, which would be faster than 32-bit color. <a name="846" id="846"/><a name="IDX-265" id="IDX-265"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you want to change your color depth, then you have to go to the Main  menu and select <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Display</b>. After providing the requested root  password, you will see the Display Settings window, in which you can change your  color depth (you can also change the screen resolution here too). Once you are  done, click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. The changes will take effect after you log out and then back in  again, or after you restart your machine.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">I’ve kept you in the GNOME world for as long as I can, but it is human nature to want to see what is on the other side of the fence. However, I’d like to say a few  words before you journey off to KDE land.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Up until now, I have not dealt with KDE in this book other than in regard to  a few KDE applications. As I mentioned earlier, this is because I feel that  GNOME is much easier for beginners to deal with. GNOME is also the default  environment in Fedora and it is thus a bit more developed (at least in Fedora).  And finally, I just like it better in terms of look, feel, and convenience (after all, it  has the ever-useful Nautilus emblems and CD Burner). If you really want to hear  more about the reasons for my GNOME orientation, then take a trip to the Edgy  Penguins site (<a target="_top" href="http://www.edgy-penguins.org/compurants">www.edgy-penguins.org/compurants</a>) where I spell it all out. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you do get over to the “other side,” you will find that KDE looks  amazingly similar to GNOME, as both use the Bluecurve theme, though the  window borders in the KDE version are of the pre-Fedora variety. There are  other subtle differences here and there, of course, but armed with your newfound Linux skills, you should be able to handle yourself without difficulty. I am  a firm believer in the learn-through-exploration school of thought.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To boot into KDE, get to your login screen either by starting up your machine or  by logging out of your current GNOME session. Click the word <b class="calibre13">Session</b> at the  bottom of the login screen. This will open a small window in which you should  select <b class="calibre13">KDE </b>and then click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. Type your username and user password and press ENTER, and a small message window will open, telling you that you have selected  to use the KDE desktop for the following session and that you will need to use the  Switchdesk utility if you want to make KDE your default environment. The only  choice you have in this window is to click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, so click it, which just tells the  system, “Yeah, yeah, I understand, let’s get on with it.”</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now if you are a Red Hat Linux 9 user, you too will be presented with a small  message window; however, yours will ask you on the spot if you want to make  KDE your default environment for future logins. I would recommend clicking  <b class="calibre13">No</b> your first time out, until you know whether you really prefer KDE or not.  Either way, it doesn’t really matter, as you can always make GNOME your default  desktop again by going through the same process.<a name="849" id="849"/><a name="IDX-266" id="IDX-266"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There are a few things you should know about the KDE environment to make  your stay over there a good one: how to kill misbehaving windows, how to take  care of general environmental issues (such as customizations and the like), and  how to take screenshots. All of these are quite different in KDE. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get rid of misbehaving windows in KDE, just use the CTRL + ALT + ESC key combo. After pressing these three keys at the same time, your cursor will turn  into a rather ominous skull and crossbones, which you can then use to zap away  any window that refuses to budge. Of course, if your misbehaving window  suddenly starts behaving, or if you suddenly change your mind, you can cancel  the scull and crossbones cursor by right-clicking your mouse anywhere — no damage done.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To take care of general KDE environmental matters, use the KDE Control  Center, which you can access by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Control  Center </b>(see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU194">Figure 19-3</a>). After it opens, you can click the <b class="calibre13">+</b> sign next to  <b class="calibre13">Appearance </b>&amp;<b class="calibre13"> Themes</b>, where you can perform most of the thematic  customizations that you did in GNOME, though many of the KDE themes will be  different from those in GNOME, and adding new ones is a bit more  cumbersome. Note that you cannot use the themes you installed in GNOME in KDE — they just ain’t the same. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To take screenshots in KDE, you must use the KDE screen capture program,  which you can access by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Screen  Capture Program</b>. The program allows you to take shots of either the whole  screen or a single window (through use of a timer), and it is pretty straight- forward and easy to understand. <a name="852" id="852"/><a name="IDX-267" id="IDX-267"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, before leaving you to your own resources in KDE land, I will mention  one feature of KDE that I do find rather handy. This is the ability of Konqueror  (KDE’s answer to Nautilus) to create thumbnails of all the images in a designated  folder and then set them up as a Web page, an example of which you can see in  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU195">Figure 19-4</a>. To take advantage of this cool feature, navigate to the folder that has the images you want to thumbnail, and then in the <b class="calibre13">Tools</b> menu of the  Konqueror window, select <b class="calibre13">Create Image Gallery</b>. The rest should be clear to you  after that. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">So let’s say that you’ve taken a liking to KDE and want to stick with it for a while,  or that you’ve been giving KDE a try for a while and want to come back home to  GNOME. To change your default desktop environment, you will have to use the  Switchdesk utility.<a name="855" id="855"/><a name="IDX-268" id="IDX-268"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can run Switchdesk by going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">System  Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> More System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Desktop Switching Tool</b>. This will bring up a  very simple window (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU196">Figure 19-5</a>) from which you can choose KDE (or GNOME, if you want to switch back after making KDE your default environment). After making your choice, click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and you will get another message  window telling you that your default desktop system setting has been updated,  and the change you made will take effect after restarting. Just click <b class="calibre13">OK</b> to close that window. Don’t go messing with the TWM selection at the bottom, as it will  take you to a creepy place you won’t want to be. I won’t say more than that, but  if you do ignore my warning and end up not knowing how to get out of TWM  land, just left-click the completely empty TWM desktop, and select <b class="calibre13">Exit</b> from the  pop-up menu.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you no doubt already know, things move quickly in the computer world, and  as such changes will already have been made to your operating system before you  even get it installed on your machine. This is true not only of Linux but also of  Windows, Macintosh OS, and every other operating system. These changes are  available to users in two forms: updates and upgrades.</p>
<div class="calibre10">
<h3 class="sect3-title">
<a name="858" class="calibre15" id="858"/><a name="wbp21Chapter19P44" class="calibre15" id="wbp21Chapter19P44"/><i class="emphasis">Updating</i>
</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Almost all operating systems have some mechanism by which you can update  your system. Updates are minor changes to your system or any application within  it. These are usually released on a need-be basis in order to fix some bug (such as  the Package Manager bug in Fedora 1), take care of some recently discovered  security vulnerability, add some feature, or add additional hardware support (such as support for more recent digital camera models). Depending on what  your needs, concerns, and download speed happen to be, you may want to  download every available update, pick and choose among updates, or just not  bother at all.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are interested in updating your system, you may recall that you’ve  already learned one way to do so in <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a>. As pointed out in that chapter,  using Synaptic is a very easy way to keep your system up to date. It also has the  additional advantage of allowing you to update not only the standard Fedora  RPM packages, but also those non-Fedora add-on RPMs, such as Frozen-Bubble, which you downloaded from FreshRPMs (and DAG, if you also added that to the  Synaptic repositories list). <a name="859" id="859"/><a name="IDX-269" id="IDX-269"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You can also update your system using the Up2date utility, which allows you  to download updates directly from the Red Hat Network. This only works, however, with those RPM packages that come as part of the Fedora system, not those  you add later from other sources. As the Fedora packages on FreshRPMs are the  same as those on the Red Hat Network, I don’t much see the advantage in going  the Up2date route myself, but then you may see things differently, so I’ll leave  that up to you.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To use Up2date, right-click on the Red Hat Network Alert Notification Tool  (next to the clock in the GNOME panel) and select <b class="calibre13">Launch up2date</b>. You will  then be prompted for your user password, so enter that and click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. The first  time around, you will be told that you need to install a key to use the Red Hat  update agent, so click <b class="calibre13">Yes</b>, and the key will be installed very quickly. The update  agent will then appear. The agent is a handy wizard which leads you through the  update process. Just click <b class="calibre13">Forward</b> in each screen until to you reach the Available  Package Updates screen (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU197">Figure 19-6</a>).</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While most Linux distributions have an 8-month to 16-month life cycle between  major version releases, the Fedora Project plans to significantly shorten this cycle  so that new versions of Fedora Core will be released two to three times a year.  While this might seem a bit too much to deal with, you really needn’t worry  because you don’t need to upgrade your system with every new release of  Fedora Core. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned in <a href="DDU0008_split_000.html#19" target="_parent">Chapter 1</a>, the Fedora Project folks themselves state that  changes in Fedora Core will be “evolutionary, not revolutionary,” and many  changes, after all, will be of the under-the-hood variety and thus quite likely of little concern to you. If you still haven’t been soothed by my words, just remember  that there are still a good many people out there in the Linux world who are still  quite content using Red Hat Linux 7.2, which was first released in 2001 (and let’s  not forget all the Windows 2000 users who still haven’t switched to Windows XP,  or Mac OS 9 users who haven’t switched to OS X).</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Whether you choose to upgrade depends on you. If you are satisfied with  your system the way it is, then why bother? However, if one of the future Fedora  releases contains some feature that you think you’d like to have, go ahead and  upgrade. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The safest road to upgrading is by downloading and burning ISOs of the  operating system, as I discussed in <a href="DDU0055_split_000.html#309" target="_parent">Chapter 7</a>. This isn’t such a good idea, however, if you don’t have a broadband Internet connection, as each ISO could take  you a couple of days to download. It also makes no sense at all if you don’t have a  CD burner. In such cases, it is probably worth your time and peace of mind to  just order the installation CDs from one of the services listed at the very end of  <a href="DDU0150_split_000.html#946" target="_parent">Appendix B</a>. The CDs from such services are priced very reasonably, delivered  quickly, and will save you a lot of time.<a name="863" id="863"/><a name="IDX-271" id="IDX-271"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have a set of installation CDs in your hands, then you can go about upgrading by roughly following the installation process you learned in <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a>. Of course, before you perform any upgrade, it is always a very good idea to  back up the data on your machine. Once you’ve done that, just go through the  installation process as normal until you get to the Upgrade Examine screen of  Step 6 (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU198">Figure 19-7</a> on the next page). </p>

An upgrade allows you to keep your settings, add-on  applications, and even data (back up first anyway, just in case). However, with an  upgrade you might also end up keeping any problems you had before. Opting  for a fresh install, on the other hand, wipes your Linux partitions clean before  installing an entirely new system in its place. I prefer the latter method, but  which you choose is up to you. You can always try the upgrade route first, and  then if you have any problems you can just do a fresh install later. <a name="865" id="865"/><a name="IDX-272" id="IDX-272"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To perform an upgrade, choose <b class="calibre13">Upgrade an existing installation</b>. The rest should  be quite automatic after that, and when you are all done, you should have a newly  upgraded system with all your previous settings in tact. To perform a fresh installation, choose <b class="calibre13">Install Fedora Core</b> and then follow the rest of the steps just as  they are written in <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a>. If you have a dual-boot setup and are performing a  fresh install, you do not need to go through the dual-boot procedures given in  <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a> again; just follow the standard installation procedures but be sure to select <b class="calibre13">Remove all Linux partitions on this machine</b> when you get to Step 9.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One last thing worth mentioning: If you are using APT and Synaptic, as you  learned to do in <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a>, you will probably have to reinstall those two files  when you upgrade your system. So just go to <a target="_top" href="http://www.freshrpms.net">www.freshrpms.net</a> and download a  new version of APT that matches the version of your newly upgraded system. If  you’ve performed an upgrade rather than a fresh install, you may find that if you  try to install the APT file by double-clicking on it, you will get a message telling  you that APT is already installed. You want to upgrade that version of APT, so  install it via the command Terminal instead. This is quite easily done by first  becoming root using the <i class="calibre11">su</i> command, and then typing <span>rpm -Uvh apt*</span> (be sure  that you don’t have any other file called <span>apt</span> in your home folder when you do  this), and then tapping ENTER. Once you’ve done that, follow the procedures for  updating the APT database and then installing Synaptic that you learned in  <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now we come to a short collection of essentially unrelated items that did not  make it into the book elsewhere, either because I hadn’t yet introduced the  necessary skills when the relevant topic came up, or because this was the most  appropriate place for it. In any case, all of the topics here, though unrelated to  one another, are worth a mention.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">While the Mozilla browser is capable of dealing with Java commands, it is not  capable of running Java applications, or <i class="calibre11">applets</i>, as is. Such applets come in many forms. Most browser-based online games, for example, are Java applets. If you’ve  ever looked for a house online and took a virtual tour of one the listings so as to  have a look around the place, you also were most likely using a Java applet.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In order to use Java applets in Fedora Core, you need to install two  components: the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and a plugin so that Mozilla  knows where and how to access the JRE. In the past, gettting the JRE successfully  up and running in Linux was quite the pain, and the many “how do I. . .”  questions on the various online Linux forums is testimony to that fact.  Fortunately, the DAG respository now has both the JRE and Mozilla JRE plugins  available as RPMs, thus making everything clean and easy. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get both files, go to <a target="_top" href="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/j2re">http://dag.wieers.com/packages/j2re</a> and download  the most recent JRE file. The JRE file is quite big at 18.8MB, so be prepared for a  somewhat lengthy download. The Mozilla plugin will prove a much quicker  download, as it is only a 198KB file. It is available on the same page as the JRE,  but closer to the bottom.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have downloaded both files, it is easy enough to install them via  the double-click method you learned in <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a>. As the Mozilla-j2re RPM is  dependent upon the j2re RPM, you will have to install the j2re RPM first. After you are done, you will probably want to test things out to make sure that all went  according to plan. For a quick, easy, and totally off-the-wall example of a simple  Java appet at work, go to <a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/applets/other/BouncingHeads">http://java.sun.com/applets/other/BouncingHeads.</a>  Once you get there, be a bit patient because, depending on the speed of your  Internet connection, it will take the applet a bit of time to load and then start  running.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you are a Linux user, you will no doubt download future versions of  Fedora Core in the form of ISOs from the Internet. Most download sites also  provide what is called a <i class="calibre11">checksum</i>, or <i class="calibre11">md5sum</i>, file that you can use to check the  integrity of the downloaded ISOs. The question most newbies have, however, is  how to check the integrity of their newly downloaded ISOs with that file. <a name="869" id="869"/><a name="IDX-273" id="IDX-273"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Here’s how to do it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Place the ISOs and the md5sum file in the same folder. It doesn’t matter if  there are other files, or even different ISOs, in that folder or not — just make  sure there are no other md5sum files in that folder. Next, open a Terminal  window and type this command: </p>
<pre class="programlisting">md5sum -c MD5SUM </pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your md5sum filename uses lowercase letters replace <span>MD5SUM</span> with <span>md5sum</span>. Then press ENTER. The output in your Terminal window should look something like  that in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU199">Figure 19-8</a>.</p>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 19-8: </span> md5sum results in the Terminal window </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see in the example, the md5sum of the Fedora Core beta (codenamed Severn) checks not only for the main installation ISOs, but also for the  source ISOs. As I did not download the source ISOs, md5sum could not find  them. It did, however, find the three installation ISOs I had downloaded,  checked them, and found them to be okay.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you make your way through the Linux world, you are eventually going to hear  mention of <i class="calibre11">man</i> pages. Man (manual) pages are basically the original Linux  online documentation system, and you will discover that there is a man page for  almost every application and command on your system. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite the fact that man pages are loaded with just about all the pertinent  information you would ever need to have, there is a rather problematic aspect to  the whole thing: Man pages are nearly impossible for newbies to understand.  Fortunately, you can pretty much get by without using man pages in the  beginning, as there are usually other forms of help available (README files in  tarballs or GNOME and KDE documents, for example). <a name="872" id="872"/><a name="IDX-274" id="IDX-274"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">However, as you get more and more used to your system and you have a bit  more of an understanding of the world of Linux, you might actually come to  understand the contents of the man pages, little by little. Man pages are opened  and viewed through your Command Terminal. To view a man page, you just type the word <span>man</span> followed by the name of the command, application, or utility you  want to find out about. For example, to see the man page for the <b class="calibre13">cp</b> (copy) command, you would type <span>man cp</span> and then press ENTER. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU200">Figure 19-9</a>, the man page will open up in your Terminal  window. To scroll up or down through a man page, just use the up and down  cursor keys; to move up or down a page at a time, use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys. Finally, when you get to the end of a man page and you want to get  back to the normal Terminal window and your now-familiar user prompt, just  press the Q key.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, we come to one last utility that may be of value to many readers, as Epson  inkjet printers are pretty common. If you are using an Epson inkjet printer and  would like to know how to check your printer’s ink levels, you can download and  install the <b class="calibre13">gimp-print-utils</b> package with Synaptic/APT by typing <span>gimp-print-utils </span>in the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box. This package includes the <b class="calibre13">escputil</b> program. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To use the program, first check the device location of your printer in the  Hardware Browser. Start the Hardware browser by going to the Main menu and  selecting<b class="calibre13"> System Tools </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Hardware Browser</b>, and once the browser is open, click  <b class="calibre13">Printers</b> in the left pane. Your printer will probably be <b class="calibre13">/dev/lp0.</b>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you know your printer’s location, open a Terminal window, become  root, and then type <span>escputil -r /dev/lp0 -i</span> (changing the device location if yours  is different) and press ENTER. Once you’ve done that, your present ink levels will  appear in your Terminal.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<a name="877" id="877"/><a name="IDX-276" id="IDX-276"/>I should first say that I am not very keen on programming. I guess my mind is just  too jumbled and illogical to deal with it, and I probably had my fill of code after  keying in all those Atari games in my early computing days. Nevertheless, many  people want to know what it takes to program and what they need to do it. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Most of what you need is included in your Fedora Core system, and there  are, in fact, many options. The language that seems to be most popular and that  is supposedly easiest for newbies to deal with is called <i class="calibre11">Python</i>. As you may recall,  the pyWings oracle, which you installed in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a>, was written in Python.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In order to get a little taste of this programming thing, I’ll give you a couple  of sample programs you can play with. The first program in almost any programming book is a silly little thing called “Hello, World.” All the program does is  print out the words “Hello, World” to your screen. This always seemed weird to  me, as the only person looking at the output of the program is the person who  keyed in the code, not “the world.” So let’s change that standard intro program  just a bit, and make it more valuable to your self-esteem. Let’s do a “Hey, good  looking” program instead. It really is the same thing anyway.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To write the program, open Gedit by going to your Main menu and selecting  <b class="calibre13">Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Text Editor</b>. In the Gedit window, type the following two lines —  quotation marks too:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">print "Hey, good looking!"
print "You are looking fine today."</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve done that, click the <b class="calibre13">Save</b> button, and save the program to your  Home folder as<span> goodlooking.py</span>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You’ve now written a program, be it ever so humble. Now, open up  a Terminal window, and run the program by typing <span>python goodlooking.py </span>and pressing ENTER. The output will appear in the Terminal window (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU201">Figure 19-10</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Makes you feel kind of good, doesn’t it? Now, if you want to get a tad more  carried away, you can create a simple window for this ego-affirming program of  yours by using tkinter. As you may recall, you installed tkinter in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a> for  use by the pyWings oracle, which used tkinter for the same purpose. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To write the program so that it will open in a window of its own, open Gedit  again, and this time type the following:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">from Tkinter import Label, mainloop
Label (text='Hey, good looking!\n'
'You are looking fine today.').pack()
mainloop()</pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Note that there are no spaces anywhere after the word <b class="calibre13">today</b> in the third line and  no spaces between<b class="calibre13"> mainloop</b> and <b class="calibre13">()</b> in the last line.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Save this new program to your Home folder as <span>goodlooking2.py</span>. Once you’ve  done that, go back to your Terminal window and type <span>python goodlooking2.py </span>and press ENTER. Your new program will then appear in its own window (see  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU202">Figure 19-11</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite the fact that there is a Linux equivalent to most of the Windows  programs that people use or need, there may be one or two programs that you  will come to miss. For me it’s a freeware version of the Austrian card game  Schnapsen. Fortunately, it is possible to run some Windows applications from  within Linux with the help of a program called Wine.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The folks at Wine seem keen on pointing out that Wine is not a Windows  emulator, preferring to call it a Windows compatibility layer. Whatever way you  choose to look at it, its function is to allow you to run Windows apps without  having Windows installed on your machine. That said, it is only fair to point out  that Wine is still a work in progress. It works fairly well with some programs and  not at all with others. There are some commercial versions of Wine that might  work better in some cases (check out the links on the Wine homepage —<a target="_top" href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a>), but there’s no harm in giving the free official version a try first,  especially now that you are about ready to move beyond non-geek status.<a name="881" id="881"/><a name="IDX-277" id="IDX-277"/>

For the  purpose of this project, however, this fact should not be of great concern to you  — you are just learning how to do things, and using some pretty cool games as  your learning tools.

<span><span>Figure 19-14: </span> A Windows installer running under Wine.</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">All you really need do to start the installation process is click <b class="calibre13">Next.</b> The installer  will create a BookWorm folder within a PopCap Games folder within the  Program Files folder of your fake_windows partition. As the installer nears the  end of the process, you will get a warning message telling you that the installer  couldn’t create some link, after which you will be told that the installation has been aborted and that you probably cannot run BookWorm Deluxe. Just ignore  all that, as all will be fine (in this case, at least). <a name="890" id="890"/><a name="IDX-280" id="IDX-280"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now you can run BookWorm Deluxe. The most straightforward way of doing  this is to head over to your new fake_windows partition. You can do this by  opening a Nautilus window and typing <span>/home/username/.wine/fake_windows/Program Files</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Location</b> box of that window and then hitting ENTER. Once there,  double click the <b class="calibre13">PopCap Games</b> folder, and then the <b class="calibre13">BookWorm Deluxe</b> folder  within that. Finally, just double-click<b class="calibre13"> BookWorm.exe</b> and you will soon be  impressing all those around you with the great depth and breadth of your  vocabulary.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you’re interested in what other applications are supposed to run under  Wine, have a look at the Wine application database at <a target="_top" href="http://appdb.winehq.org">http://appdb.winehq.org,</a> which also tells what version of Wine a given application is known to work under,  and what limitations, if any, a program has when running under Wine.</p>
