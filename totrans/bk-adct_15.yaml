    it will be converted to the project value. This doesn’t change the files because
    the conversion is done on the fly for playback only. Best Sinc Interpolater performs
    the highest-quality conversion. But it is CPU-intensive, so if playback bogs down,
    try Medium Sinc Interpolater. Fast Interpolator, Zero order hold (ZOH) interpolator,

- en: Checking this means the metadata editor will open for every individual song
    track or file at export so you can verify or edit the metadata for each one individually.
    This can be a big job if you are exporting a lot of individual songs or tracks.
    You should first enter information common to all tracks in **File** > **Open Metadata
    Editor**, and then Audacity will automatically enter this for every song and automatically
    enter each track number.

- en: I don’t believe it is a good idea for Audacity projects to depend on other Audacity
    projects. They should be self-contained. If you need to be frugal of disk space,
    then you might want your Audacity projects to share dependencies, but I think
    this is asking for trouble, because if anything changes, it will affect multiple
    projects. The safe choice is “Always copy all audio into project (safest).” “Ask
    user” is all right if you want to decide for each project individually. You can
    check whether any project has dependencies by clicking **File** > **Check Dependencies**.

    at whatever interval you select. The copy goes into a separate directory, which
    Audacity uses for autorecovery of damaged projects. It doesn’t save the data files,
    which are the ones with the *.au* extension, but rather the project metadata,
    which is kept in an XML file. Linux users can see these autosave files in */.audacity-data/AutoSave/;*
    they’re just like the project *.aup* files. On Windows XP and Vista, look in *Documents
    and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Audacity*, and on Windows 7, refer to
    *Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Audacity*.

    the Spectrum or Pitch EAC views of your tracks. These are useful for in-depth
    frequency analysis. ([Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Audacity Plug-ins for
    Special Effects") has a nice introduction to frequency analysis.) There is whole
    lot of math going on here that I do not understand, but I am grateful to the brainiacs
    who do understand the math and refine the algorithms that make digital audio engineering
    possible. The first setting, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Window, controls how
    much frequency detail is shown. Larger FFT sizes show more bass frequencies and
    less detailed time resolution.

    and Gaussian. In the plainest terms I can think of, without digging into the math,
    these are graphical views of digital signals intended to aid detailed analysis.
    According to the Wikipedia article “Window Function” ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function/](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function/)),
    Blackman-Harris is a lower-resolution, high-dynamic range window, while all the
    others are high- and moderate-resolution windows.

    very slow computer. Checking this option keeps all recording in memory until you
    stop recording, and then it is written to disk. It will certainly speed up performance
    on a computer with a very slow hard drive. But one little power blip or running
    out of RAM means your recording session is lost. There isn’t as much risk on a
    laptop since it has a battery, and you can set a minimum memory threshold to trigger
    writing to disk. Audacity has a hard-coded minimum of 16MB RAM, so you can’t use
    a lower setting than that.
