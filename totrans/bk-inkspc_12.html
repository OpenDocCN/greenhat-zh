That’s why a familiarity with paths is so important—without it, you cannot really say you know how to work in a vector editor.</p><p>Inkscape provides a versatile selection of tools, commands, and effects that work on paths. We will start with the basics of SVG paths and the traditional path tools whose analogs you may have already seen in other software. Then, in the second half of this chapter and in the next one, we will look at the advanced Inkscape techniques for path editing that are often more efficient—and almost always a lot more fun to use. You may find, for example, the Tweak tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s06.html" title="12.6 Path Tweaking">12.6 Path Tweaking</a></strong></span>) so easy and natural that you will rarely want to resort to the more technical and low-level Node tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html" title="12.5 The Node Tool">12.5 The Node Tool</a></strong></span>). Still, it is important that you know what a path consists of and are able, when necessary, to directly manipulate path nodes, as this is one of the cornerstones of vector graphics of any kind.</p></div>

In a closed subpath, the start node and the end node are the same node; in an open subpath, start and end nodes are different.

Now, let’s have a closer look at those curved segments, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Bézier curves</em></span> after Pierre Bézier (1910–1999), a French engineer who was the first to use them in design.</p><p><a id="iddle1237" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1240" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1251" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2935" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2977" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3002" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3379" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4135" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4724" class="indexterm"/>A Bézier curve is completely determined by the position of four points, two of which are the <span class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span> and two of which are the <span class="emphasis"><em>handles</em></span>, or controls. The curve itself is always completely inside the quadrilateral of these four points. In the Node tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html" title="12.5 The Node Tool">12.5 The Node Tool</a></strong></span>), each of the handles is connected with its node by a straight line. These <span class="emphasis"><em>handle lines</em></span> are always tangential to the curve at the corresponding node:</p><div class="figure"><a id="beacutezier_curves"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00171"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735898.png.jpg" alt="Bézier curves"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-6. Bézier curves</p></div><p>Note that in a path, if a node is between two Bézier curve segments, it will have two handles connected to it, one for each adjacent segment.</p><p>The way a Bézier curve reacts to moving its handles is hard to verbalize, but you will quickly get a feel for it once you experiment a little. A Bézier curve may be indistinguishably close to a circular arc, but it may also have sharp bends, almost cusps; it may self-intersect or be perfectly straight when the handles are fully retracted (i.e., coincide with their nodes).</p><p>Of course, for all its versatility, not many shapes are possible with a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> Bézier curve. When building a path to approximate something (e.g., when manually tracing over a bitmap, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch18s08.html#one8dot8dot2_the_trace_bitmap_dialog" title="18.8.2 The Trace Bitmap Dialog">18.8.2 The Trace Bitmap Dialog</a></strong></span>), experience will tell you how far you can reach with the next Bézier curve and where best to place the next node. Forcing a path to more closely approximate some real-life shape usually involves subdividing its Béziers by adding nodes and adjusting their handles. In contrast, simplifying a path, either manually or with the <span class="strong"><strong>Simplify</strong></span> command (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s03.html" title="12.3 Simplifying">12.3 Simplifying</a></strong></span>), usually reduces the number of nodes and results in longer Bézier curves.</p></div></div>

<div class="sect1" title="12.3 Simplifying"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="one2dot3_simplifying"/>12.3 Simplifying</h1></div></div></div><p>A very important operation on paths is <span class="emphasis"><em>simplifying</em></span>. When you simplify a path (<span class="strong"><strong>Path</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Simplify</strong></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00539"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), Inkscape attempts to redraw that path using fewer nodes, ironing out smaller details but preserving the large-scale features and the overall shape. If this description sounds a bit vague, it’s because the operation itself is not entirely deterministic; usually, it is difficult to accurately predict the result of simplifying before you actually try it. Even the reduction of the number of nodes is not guaranteed, although common.</p><p>Despite that, it is a very common operation and a true lifesaver for certain styles of artistic drawing. In technical drawing, on the other hand, it is rarely <a id="iddle1092" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2398" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2641" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2932" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2978" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3003" class="indexterm"/>useful, if only because it considers any sharp corners in a path to be “defects” that should be smoothed out.</p><p>One effect that you can almost always count on is that if your path has nodes that can be deleted without <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> change in the shape of the path, they <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> get deleted by simplifying. This includes any nodes you have added with the Node tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s05.html#one2dot5dot3_deleting_and_creating_nodes" title="12.5.3 Deleting and Creating Nodes">12.5.3 Deleting and Creating Nodes</a></strong></span>) or by the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Nodes</strong></span> extension (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch13s03.html" title="13.3 Path Extensions">13.3 Path Extensions</a></strong></span>) but never moved from their initial positions.</p><p>Path simplification is similar to gradient simplification in the Gradient tool, also accessible by <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00540"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10s05.html#one0dot5dot1_creating_middle_stops" title="10.5.1 Creating Middle Stops">10.5.1 Creating Middle Stops</a></strong></span>). Gradient simplification, too, removes any gradient stops that you added but didn’t yet move from their initial positions.</p><p>Any simplification operation uses a certain <span class="emphasis"><em>force</em></span>. Weak simplification changes the path just a little, removing only the most obviously redundant nodes. Stronger simplification will change the path more and smooth out larger bumps in it.</p><p>The default force used when you press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00541"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span> can be set in the <span class="strong"><strong>Simplification threshold</strong></span> value on the <span class="strong"><strong>Misc</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog. The default is 0.002; anything greater than 0.01 is probably too strong for most cases. If you change it at all, consider lowering this value, because it is actually the <span class="emphasis"><em>minimum</em></span> simplification force; you can always temporarily strengthen your <span class="strong"><strong>Simplify</strong></span> command, raising this value without going into the <span class="strong"><strong>Inkscape Preferences</strong></span> dialog.</p><p>How to make <span class="strong"><strong>Simplify</strong></span> stronger? Just press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00542"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> several times in quick succession. Each invocation of the command will increase the force a little, provided it happened less than half a second after the previous invocation. With such <span class="emphasis"><em>accelerated simplification</em></span>, you can apply exactly the amount of simplification you need for each path. If the first keystroke didn’t smooth the path enough, just keep pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00543"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735764.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, and it will gradually pick up.

Offsetting inward is called <span class="emphasis"><em>insetting</em></span>, and offsetting outward is called <span class="emphasis"><em>outsetting</em></span>. Imagine that your path is an island; then, outsetting means enlarging it by moving every point of the shoreline the same number of steps seaward, and insetting makes it smaller by allowing the sea to encroach inland by the same number of steps everywhere:</p><div class="figure"><a id="offsetting_paths"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00179"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735924.png.jpg" alt="Offsetting paths"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-14. Offsetting paths</p></div><p>To inset the selected path or paths, press either <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00544"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735926.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> (inset by 2 px), or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00545"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735928.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> (inset by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom), or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00546"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735930.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> (inset by 10 screen pixels).

On most keyboards, the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00548"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735932.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00549"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735934.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> are on the same keys as <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00550"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735814.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00551"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735816.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, so the digits will work the same as the parentheses.</p><p>Offsetting is used in situations where you want to make a path “bolder” or “thinner” without changing its overall shape. This is useful for shadows, outlines, halos, bevels, and the like. (Sometimes, instead of outsetting you can simply set a wide enough stroke on the path, colored the same as its fill.)</p><p>If you outset and inset a path several times, it becomes distorted in a characteristic way, similar but distinct from the distortion of simplification (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12s03.html" title="12.3 Simplifying">12.3 Simplifying</a></strong></span>). Such distortion welds together parts of a path, rounding corners, smoothing the intersections, and fusing together close brush strokes within a path. For example, try to union all brush strokes of a drawing, and do a few inset/outset cycles on it to make it appear more natural and worn-down, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch12s04.html#melting_complex_paths_with_repeated_offs" title="Figure 12-15. Melting complex paths with repeated offsetting">Figure 12-15</a>.</p><p>Offsetting, just like simplification, is a destructive operation: You cannot restore the exact original path except by undoing it.

With the Tweak tool, you can forget everything you ever knew about nodes; just interact with your path as a pliable body, like a lump of modeling clay, bending and sculpting it at any point and in any direction.

However, you can just as well drag to chase the moving edge of the path; this way, using a small-sized brush, you can grow appendages and branches of any length out of a path. (Such growing can also be done in Push mode, but Grow is somewhat easier for this task.) Also, the Shrink mode can act as a quick eraser. Cutting through paths, evaporating small crumbs and bits, and trimming long brush strokes is very easy in this mode:</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_shrink_mode_as_an_eraser"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00202"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1736006.png.jpg" alt="Using Shrink mode as an eraser"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-37. Using Shrink mode as an eraser</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="12.6.5 Attract/Repel Mode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="one2dot6dot5_attractsolidusrepel_mode"/>12.6.5 Attract/Repel Mode</h2></div></div></div><p>The Attract/Repel mode (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00649"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735972.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) works by moving each affected point on a path toward (attract, plain drag) or from (repel, drag with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00650"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) the cursor point, pinching and exploding whatever paths fall under the brush. In some cases, this may look similar to Shrink/Grow, but the difference is that Attract/Repel doesn’t care about the direction of the path being tweaked.
