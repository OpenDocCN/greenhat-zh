The good news is that Linux can match anything that your previous operating system could do online, and in many cases it can do it faster or more easily. Ubuntu was born on the Web, so it should be no surprise that it comes with a very healthy suite of Internet-ready applications right out of the box.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0320" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In this chapter, you'll take a tour of Ubuntu's Internet software so you can start really getting a feel for what this Linux stuff is capable of. You'll begin with old stalwarts like the web browser and email client, tour briefly through instant messaging, and then head off in the more modish direction of Twitter and microblogging.</p><div class="sect1" title="Firefox: Your Internet Browser"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="firefox_colon_your_internet_browser"/>Firefox: Your Internet Browser</h1></div></div></div><p>The default web browser in your Ubuntu system is Firefox, which is enjoying increasing popularity in not only the Linux world but in the Windows and Mac worlds as well. Chances are you are already a Firefox user, but if you are not, then you needn't worry—things work more or less the same in all browsers. That being the case, you should be able to use Firefox's basic features without any instruction. Of course, some of its features do distinguish Firefox from its competition, so I will mention those.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0322" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0323" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0324" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0321" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="controlling_browser_window_clutter_with"/>Controlling Browser Window Clutter with Tabs</h2></div></div></div><p>Usually when you click a link on a web page, the new page opens in the same window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a new, separate window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a new window by right-clicking the link and then selecting the Open Link in New Window option. This can be very useful; however, once you have more than a few browser windows open, it gets sort of hard to find what you're looking for in all those open windows. It can also slow things down a bit.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0325" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This is where Firefox's tab feature comes in handy (so handy, in fact, that almost every other browser out there has copied it). To see how it works, try it yourself right here and now. Open your Firefox browser by clicking the launcher on the top GNOME panel (or selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Internet</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Firefox Web Browser</strong></span>); then search for the word <span class="emphasis"><em>nyckelharpa</em></span> using Firefox's handy search box, which is at the top-right corner of the browser window (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#performing_a_google_search_from_the_fire" title="Figure 5-1. Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box">Figure 5-1</a>). By default, Firefox will perform searches for keywords entered in the search box using Google. You can, if you like, select other websites to search by clicking the colored <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> icon in the search box and then making your selection. Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! are available, to name a few, and you can even add others. For now, however, let's stick to Google for our present search, by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>nyckelharpa</code></strong> in that search box. Once you've finished typing, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> key, after which a page of search results should appear in the main pane of the Firefox window.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0326" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0327" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0328" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0329" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One of the top results should be the American Nyckelharpa Association, and you are now going to open that page in a new tab, rather than in the same or a new window. To do that, right-click the link, and in the pop-up menu that appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Open Link in New Tab</strong></span>. You can, if you prefer, make things a tad easier and dispense with the pop-up menu selection step by simply clicking the link with the middle mouse button (or with both mouse buttons simultaneously) or by holding down the <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span> key as you click the link. Either way, the new page will appear in a new tab, while your original page of search results remains, ready and waiting in the other tab (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#a_link_opened_in_a_new_tab_in_firefox" title="Figure 5-2. A link opened in a new tab in Firefox">Figure 5-2</a>). I am pretty confident in saying that, once you get used to this feature, you will wonder how you ever got along without it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="performing_a_google_search_from_the_fire"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4737"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656186.png.jpg" alt="Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-1. Performing a Google search from the Firefox search box</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="a_link_opened_in_a_new_tab_in_firefox"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4745"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656188.png.jpg" alt="A link opened in a new tab in Firefox"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-2. A link opened in a new tab in Firefox</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keeping_up-to-date_with_live_bookmarks"/>Keeping Up-to-Date with Live Bookmarks</h2></div></div></div><p>The Web is awash with all sorts of news and information, and it can be hard to keep tabs on it all. Personally, I hate missing my daily dose of offbeat stories from Boing Boing, the aptly subtitled "directory of wonderful things" (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.boingboing.net/">http://www.boingboing.net/</a>). Fortunately, Firefox has a neat way of dealing with your information overload, called <span class="emphasis"><em>live bookmarks</em></span> (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>RSS feeds</em></span>). These provide you with an automatically updated list of articles from any website that supports them. To see an example, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Latest Headlines</strong></span> link underneath Firefox's address bar—it's a live bookmark for the BBC News website and should show you a long list of current news stories.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0330" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0331" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0332" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0333" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0334" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0335" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0336" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0337" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0338" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0339" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0340" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0341" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0342" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0343" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can check whether a website has an RSS feed by looking in the address bar for an orange beacon symbol (like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#the_beacon_icon_is_displayed_when_a_webs" title="Figure 5-3. The beacon icon is displayed when a website has an associated RSS feed.">Figure 5-3</a>). If it has one, you're in business! Let's use Boing Boing as an example: Load <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boingboing.net/">http://www.boingboing.net/</a> in Firefox, and click the beacon icon. You'll get a list of the most recent articles along with an invitation to subscribe to the feed in the box at the top of the page. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Subscribe Now</strong></span>, and in the window that appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Subscribe</strong></span> to add the live bookmark to the same toolbar as the Latest Headlines link.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_beacon_icon_is_displayed_when_a_webs"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e4840"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656190.png.jpg" alt="The beacon icon is displayed when a website has an associated RSS feed."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-3. The beacon icon is displayed when a website has an associated RSS feed.</p></div><p>Some websites provide links to their RSS feeds rather than showing them in the address bar. If you find one of these links (it's normally called <span class="emphasis"><em>ATOM</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>RSS/XML</em></span>), click it, and you should be taken to a list of articles with a box at the top, like in the previous example. From there, the steps for adding the feed to your bookmarks are the same.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pop-up Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pop-up_manager"/>Pop-up Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>Firefox has a number of other useful features. One is its Popup Manager, which suppresses those annoying pop-up windows that often appear when you access a new web page. You can enable or disable this feature from the Preferences window (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>) by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> icon in the top pane of that window and then checking or unchecking the <span class="strong"><strong>Block pop-up windows</strong></span> box. You can also permit certain sites to provide pop-up windows (some pop-ups are not only useful but necessary for the correct functioning of a site) by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Exceptions</strong></span> button to the right of that Block pop-up windows entry and inputting the web address for the site in question.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0344" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0345" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Multimedia Plug-Ins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="multimedia_plug-ins"/>Multimedia Plug-Ins</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the coolest things about Firefox is that it allows you to further expand its functionality by adding various extensions. The most commonly used extensions come in the form of <span class="emphasis"><em>plug-ins</em></span>. These allow web pages to do much more than just display text and pictures—you'll often need a plug-in to watch videos or play games online. Three plug-ins are used far more widely than any others, so I'll concentrate on those here.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0346" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect3" title="Flash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="flash"/>Flash</h3></div></div></div><p>The most frequently used browser plug-in for any system is Adobe's Flash Player. Flash provides websites with all sorts of exciting multimedia effects and capabilities, and as a result, it is used by an ever-increasing number of sites. In fact, chances are you've probably seen numerous Flash-enhanced pages without even being aware of it. For example, if you've ever watched a video on YouTube, you've enjoyed the wonders of Flash.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0349" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0350" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0347" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0348" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0351" class="indexterm"/></p><p>How do you get the Flash Player plug-in?

It's less common than Flash but seems to be used on the websites of TV channels and major sporting events quite a lot. Unfortunately, Microsoft is a little behind the times, and it hasn't made Silverlight available for Linux yet. But never fear: An alternative, open source plug-in called Moonlight is available.

In contrast to the multifunctional Evolution, Thunderbird (<a class="xref" href="ch05s04.html#the_thunderbird_email_client" title="Figure 5-13. The Thunderbird email client">Figure 5-13</a>) is a more mail-oriented program that is very straightforward to use yet includes most of the most important email functions you've come to expect, such as junk mail filters. In fact, it is remarkably similar to Windows Mail in terms of appearance and handling. The fact that Thunderbird is also available in both Mac and Windows versions means that you may already be familiar with it.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0385" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0386" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0387" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0388" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0389" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_thunderbird_email_client"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_d1e5369"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656210.png.jpg" alt="The Thunderbird email client"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 5-13. The Thunderbird email client</p></div><p>Thunderbird does not come bundled with Ubuntu, so if you want to try it, you will have to download it and install it yourself. Now that you have set up your machine to connect to the Internet, however, you can easily do this after going over the contents of <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a> (OK, so I'm jumping the gun a bit again). Just do a search in the Ubuntu Software Center for <span class="emphasis"><em>thunderbird</em></span>, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird Mail/News</strong></span> item once, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to install it. You may be asked to type the password for your Ubuntu user account, so do that and click <span class="strong"><strong>Authenticate</strong></span>. Once it is installed, you can then run Thunderbird by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Internet</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird Mail/News</strong></span>.</p><p>As I mentioned, both Evolution and Thunderbird are equally capable and possess essentially the same features in terms of mail handling. The difference is primarily a look-and-feel matter. Why not try both Evolution and Thunderbird and see which you like better?</p><p>By the way, if you find that you prefer Thunderbird to Evolution, you can add a panel launcher for it to make things easier on yourself when you want to run the program. Just go to <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Internet</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird Mail/News</strong></span>, right-click that entry, and then in the pop-up menu that appears, select <span class="strong"><strong>Add this launcher to panel</strong></span>.</p></div>

What if you just fancy a quick chat? That's where <span class="emphasis"><em>instant messaging (IM)</em></span> comes in. If you're not familiar with the concept, all you do is find your friend on an IM network and type a short message to them. Your message will show up on their screen in the blink of an eye.

There are millions upon millions of blogs out there covering all sorts of subjects, from astronomy to economics to fluffy kittens. The quality of content varies wildly, but for the most part blog entries are typical newspaper-opinion-column types of pieces. So, what if you had a blog where you were forced to write everything you wanted to say in less than 140 characters? That is the idea behind microblogging: making frequent, very short, bulletin-like posts.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0402" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0403" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0404" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0405" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0406" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0407" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0408" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0409" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0410" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0400" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0401" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0411" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Twitter is the most well-known microblogging website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.twitter.com/">http://www.twitter.com/</a>).

I just followed a Twitter conversation between a few of my friends who were watching a live hockey game. They sent messages every time something exciting happened, so I could follow the action textually, within seconds of it happening. News travels fast on Twitter.</p><p>Perhaps it's the sort of thing you need to try to appreciate, so if you don't have an account already, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Sign up now</strong></span> button on the Twitter home page, and follow the instructions. Once you've done that, take a look around the website to see how things work. The basic idea is that you post messages (<span class="emphasis"><em>tweets</em></span>) for your <span class="emphasis"><em>followers</em></span> to see. People can choose to follow you by clicking a button when they view your user profile. You can choose to follow other people too—when you do this, all of their tweets will be displayed on your Twitter home page for you to read. Most people follow a few people and typically have a handful of followers themselves, but there are no restrictions on how many of each you can have.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0412" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0413" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Ubuntu's portal to the world of microblogging is called Gwibber, which was first mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A NEW PLACE TO CALL HOME">Chapter 3</a>.
