    of the more hedonistic, self-indulgent areas like gaming, music, and graphics.
    Still, as is the case for most computer users, what I usually end up doing on
    my computer is work, and writing this book falls into that category.

    I think it's safe to say that you are missing nothing and are probably gaining
    quite a bit in terms of home and office productivity programs in the world of
    Linux. In this chapter, I'll walk you through the Linux offerings in this department.

    even though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The de facto standard
    among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in both the Windows
    and Macintosh worlds. Of course, because it is a Microsoft product, you can be
    quite sure that no Linux version is available.

    of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in *free*)
    in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some lightweight sour-grapes
    substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a full-featured contender,
    and in some cases, OpenOffice.org is a clear winner.

    and the most commonly used ones come bundled with Ubuntu. These include a word
    processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), and a presentation creator and player
    (Impress), all of which you can find by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Office**.
    In addition, there is a very handy vector drawing program (Draw), which you'll
    find by selecting **Applications** ▸ **Graphics**. The database module (Base)
    and the mathematical formula editor (Math), though no longer packaged with Ubuntu,
    are still available as separate downloads via Ubuntu Software Center (by searching
    for and marking *openoffice.org-base* and *openoffice.org-math*, respectively).

    good one (see [Figure 12-1](ch12.html#openoffice.org_writer "Figure 12-1. OpenOffice.org
    Writer")). It is chock-full of features and can read and save Microsoft Word files.

    can easily change your documents into web pages.

    who don't see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will mention a few of
    the simpler tasks that can be done with Calc, in the hope of enticing some of
    you into trying it.

    used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, such as payrolls (which
    was the original purpose of such applications). That's right, of course, but spreadsheets
    can be used for everyday tasks too, such as projecting household budgets, calculating
    grade point averages (by teachers or students), figuring out how long it will
    take you to save up for your trip to Hungary, or even comparing the seat heights
    for the four or five motorcycles you are trying to choose among. And when doing
    any of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs in order to
    make all the abstract numbers speak to you visually.

- en: If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating lists
    of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, address
    lists . . . whatever. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order,
    sort them by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to find some
    use for Calc, so don't ignore it entirely.

    at least find some amusement from an Easter egg hidden within the program, which

    "Figure 12-3. Space Invaders in OpenOffice.org Calc? Yup.")). Just type **`=GAME("StarWars")`**
    into any cell in Calc, and press **enter**. The instructions are in German, but
    it should be easy enough to figure out how to play even if you don't remember
    any of your high-school Deutsch.

    receptions or conferences), or any other document in which you want a bit more
    control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the two are combined),
    such as fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this sense, Draw can be

    in question, and it will open in the appropriate OpenOffice.org module. When saving
    files within OpenOffice.org to use within earlier versions of Microsoft Office,
    however, you must save them into the appropriate format, because OpenOffice.org
    will otherwise save files into its native format (*.odt* for Writer documents,
    *.ods* for Calc documents, and *.odp* for Impress documents) by default, and only
    the most recent versions of Office can deal with these files.

    be relatively easy if you were weaned on those versions of Microsoft Office.

    it straightforward, because the basic layout is pretty intuitive. And if you are
    lacking in the intuition department, the built-in Help files are pretty good,
    too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just like tool tips in the
    Windows and Mac worlds. (In case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, *tool
    tips* are those little yellow boxes that pop up to tell you what a button or menu
    item does when you place your mouse over that button or menu item.) Another cool
    and useful help feature is What's This, which is a more detailed version of the
    Tips system. If you select **Help** ▸ **What's This**, your cursor will turn into
    a little question mark. Move that question mark cursor over almost any item in
    the OpenOffice.org interface, and you'll find out what it does rather than just
    what the item is called.

    convenient starting point for you too.

    you've been writing. You thus need to drop all of the headings you had before
    down a notch; the former main heading becoming a subheading, and so on. By double-clicking
    the word *Headings*, the text of all the headings you have listed in the document
    appears. You can then select a heading in that list and click the Demote Level

    everyday word processing chores and you would prefer something that pops up as
    soon as you click the launcher, then you might want to consider giving another
    word processor, AbiWord, a try ([Figure 12-11](ch12s02.html#the_other_linux_word_processormabiword
    "Figure 12-11. The other Linux word processor—AbiWord")).

- en: AbiWord has a very straightforward and easy-to-use interface, which you should
    be able to figure out without much, if any, help. It also has a couple of rather
    interesting features, such as its autoresize function, which magnifies the onscreen
    document size (fonts, images, and everything) or shrinks it as you increase or
    decrease the size of the program window. And in case you're wondering, AbiWord
    can save and read Microsoft Word DOC files and save documents as PDF files.

    little yellow Post-it-like notes called Sticky Notes ([Figure 12-12](ch12s03.html#gnome_apostrophy_s_sticky_notes
    "Figure 12-12. GNOME's Sticky Notes")) that come as part of the GNOME desktop.
    GNOME's Sticky Notes is a panel applet that you can add to your own panel by right-clicking
    any open panel space and then selecting **Add to Panel** in the pop-up menu that
    appears. When the Add to Panel window appears, click **Sticky Notes**, and then
    click the **Add** button. Close the Add to Panel window by clicking **Close**.
    You will then be ready for note-taking action.

    needs, then perhaps you will find yourself better served by another application
    that comes with your system, called Tomboy ([Figure 12-13](ch12s03.html#notes_taken_seriouslymtomboy
    "Figure 12-13. Notes taken seriously—Tomboy")). Like Sticky Notes, Tomboy also
    works as a panel applet, but it is a bit more full featured, albeit without making
    any claims to stickiness. Instead, the various notes you create can be viewed
    by selecting them from the menu that appears when you click the Tomboy panel applet.
    All in all, it's a very handy approach.

    functions. These allow you to search for entries within your entire Tomboy note
    library and create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to another linked
    note. In fact, Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink whenever you type
    a word that matches one of your existing note headings. To make matters even more
    exciting (or at least more useful), Tomboy, by means of its plug-ins feature,
    allows you to export notes to HTML or print them, either as hard copy or as PDF
    docs.

    operating system. Unfortunately, unless you live in Germany, you cannot use GnuCash
