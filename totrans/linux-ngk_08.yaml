- en: Well, now that you know what RPM isn’t, you are no doubt wondering what it is.
    *RPM* stands for Red Hat Package Manager, and it is a very handy system that Red
    Hat came up with to allow users to install and remove packages easily. Of course,
    at this point you may be wondering what a package is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the most basic level, a *package* is simply an archived file or an archived
    collection of files, like the ZIP (.zip) or StuffIt (.sit) files you may already
    know. Packages designed to be used with the RPM system, however, are slightly
    different. Such packages are usually called RPM packages, RPM files, or just RPMs,
    and they are easily recognizable by the .rpm extension at the end of the filename.
    An RPM package consists of an archived file or set of files, along with a set
    of installation instructions telling the system’s package manager where in the
    system to install the package files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually these RPM packages are applications, though they could be other things
    too, such as fonts or documents. The Package Manager automatically installs each
    of the components that are in the package in the proper place on your system,
    making it all very easy on you. All in all, using RPM is very similar to installing
    Windows programs with an installer.
  prefs: []

- en: Fedora (and its Red Hat Linux predecessors) is not, of course, the only distribution
    that is RPM based — other distributions, most notably Mandrake and SuSE, are also
    RPM based. However, because different distros place various system files in different
    places, and because they are compiled differently, RPM packages are often distro
    specific. Thus, an RPM package for any popular application will most likely come
    in many different flavors, so to speak, to go with the various Linux distros.
    As if that weren’t enough, there may also be different RPM packages for the different
    versions of a particular distro. For example, in the case of Red Hat Linux, you
    may find RPMs specifically designed for versions7.3, 8, 9, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you will come to notice, RPM filenames also specify a CPU architecture before
    the .rpm extension. You will thus see RPM files ending with *i386.rpm* (386 class
    CPU or better), *i586.rpm* (Pentium class CPU or better), *i686.rpm* (Pentium
    II class CPU or better), and even *ppc.rpm* (Motorola/IBM Power PC CPU, as used
    in modern Macintosh computers). Those packages labeled *noarch.rpm* (no architecture)
    can be used with any CPU.

    game called Skoosh ([Figure 8-1](#figure.DDU85)). Skoosh is not included with
    Fedora Core, so you will have to download it yourself. You can do this by going
    to [http://dag.wieers.com/](http://dag.wieers.com/) packages/skoosh. Once there,
    download the most recent file appropriate for the version of Linux you are running
    (e.g., *rh90 for Red Hat Linux 9.0* or *rhfc1* for Fedora Core 1, and so on) by
    simply clicking on the file name. The Skoosh file only weighs in at about 150KB,
    so the entire download process should be over very quickly.

    case; sometimes you will find that the RPM package you are trying to install contains
    system dependencies that your system is not set up to handle. To illustrate this
    point, let’s look at the Frozen-Bubble game.
  prefs: []

    in the Mandrake Linux distribution, but because of its popularity it made its
    way to SuSE and even Windows. It is a pleasant game with cool graphics and music.
    It is also very attractive, in that you just can’t lose. Unlike other arcade-style
    games, Frozen-Bubble lets you do a game level over and over and over and over
    until you get it right.

    Frozen-Bubble RPM file, and the Package Manager will do its usual dependency search.
    In this case, it will find that your system is lacking the Perl-SDL package, and
    it throws up a window telling you so (see [Figure 8-4](#figure.DDU88)). In order
    to get around this problem, close the warning window by clicking **OK**, and then
    just double- click the Perl-SDL file and install it. Once Perl-SDL is installed,
    go on and install Frozen-Bubble in the same manner.

    there are more. Worse yet, sometimes some of those required files that you download
    and try to install have dependencies of their own — the truly hellish scenario.
    Of course, as these dependency files might be required by other RPM packages you
    try to install in the future, you may well find that this dependency problem will
    gradually lessen for you over time.

    to shoot it. To quit the game, press the ESC key once, which will bring you to
    the high scores window where you can input your initials. Once you are done with
    that, press ENTER (or press the ESC key again to skip over it), which will bring
    you back to the opening screen. Finally, hit ESC again, and the game will close.

    it is very similar to Mozilla, as it is based on the same rendering engine. Unlike
    Mozilla, however, Epiphany is designed to be integrated into the GNOME desktop
    environment and to follow GNOME’s interface features. This is good news for customization
    freaks, as any customization features you apply to GNOME will also take effect
    in Epiphany.
