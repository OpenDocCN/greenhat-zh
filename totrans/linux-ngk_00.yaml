- en: My own computing life began long ago in the Commodore/Atari days. The purchase
    of my first machine, no doubt inspired by Alan Alda’s television commercials at
    the time, was an Atari XL600 with a cassette drive for storage, and 16KB of RAM
    — more than I thought I would ever need at the time (ha!).

  zh: 我自己的计算机生活始于很久以前的Commodore/Atari时代。我第一台机器的购买，无疑受到了当时艾伦·阿达电视广告的启发，是一台带有磁带驱动器用于存储的Atari
    XL600，以及16KB的RAM——那是我当时认为我永远需要的（哈哈）。
- en: Most of my time on that machine, I must admit, was spent playing cartridge-
    based games and typing in pages and pages of machine code from the now-defunct
    magazine *Antic* to create even more games. Eventually, my interest in computers
    increased, especially after seeing my first, and actually *the* first, Macintosh
    at the UCLA bookstore. The very in-your-face nature of the Mac’s operating system
    caused me to become an operating-system maniac. To date I have worked with almost
    every operating system there is or ever was, including Mac operating systems up
    to and including OS X, every Windows version from 3.1 to XP, and even IBM’s much
    forgotten OS/2.

  zh: 我必须承认，在那台机器上，我大部分时间都花在玩卡带游戏和输入从现在已停刊的杂志《Antic》上的页页机器代码，以创建更多的游戏。最终，我对计算机的兴趣增加了，尤其是在看到我在UCLA书店看到的第一个，实际上也是**第一个**Macintosh之后。Mac操作系统的直面感让我变成了一个操作系统狂热者。到目前为止，我几乎与所有存在的或曾经存在的操作系统都合作过，包括从OS
    X到OS X的Mac操作系统，从3.1到XP的每个Windows版本，甚至还有IBM被遗忘的OS/2。
- en: Though tempted to join the Linux fray, I continued to steer away from it for
    a long time, because I could not help but see it, as so many others do, as a system
    for never-seen-the-light-of-day-faced, late-night Dr. Pepper–drinking, Domino’s-
    pizza-eating compu-geeks. Moving to Japan and being surrounded with machines loaded
    with Japanese versions of Windows, however, presented me with numerous problems,
    such as language constraints. As everything, including help files, was written
    in Japanese, I ended up using only a fraction of the full potential of most software.
    Then there were those annoying Windows-type problems, such as the constant freezes
    and restarts, and the gradual system slowdowns, which were eventually only remedied
    by reinstalling the system. Getting the software I needed to do the things I wanted
    to do also took its toll on my wallet, and I began to rethink my initial resistance
    to Linux. With Linux’s multilingual support, system stability, and extensive and
    free software packages, there were plenty of incentives for me to get over my
    obsession with the stereotypical Linux user.

  zh: 虽然很想去Linux的纷争中，但我长时间继续避开它，因为我无法不把它看作是那些从未见过光明、深夜喝Dr. Pepper、吃多米诺披萨的电脑极客的系统。然而，搬到日本并被装满日本版Windows的机器包围，给我带来了许多问题，比如语言限制。由于包括帮助文件在内的一切都是用日语编写的，我最终只能使用大多数软件的很小一部分。然后还有那些令人烦恼的Windows类型的问题，比如不断的冻结和重启，以及逐渐的系统变慢，这些问题最终只能通过重新安装系统来解决。获取我需要用来完成我想做的事情的软件也给我的钱包带来了负担，我开始重新思考我对Linux的最初抵制。由于Linux的多语言支持、系统稳定性和广泛的免费软件包，我有足够的动力克服对典型Linux用户的迷恋。
- en: After a few failed attempts at getting Linux to work on the oddball Frankenstein-like
    collection of junk that was my computer, I finally succeeded the safe way with
    a CD-based Knoppix distribution, which worked well enough to hook me in a little
    further. I then moved on to Mandrake, as that was claimed to be the most newbie-friendly
    version, and then tried out SuSE as well, which I found rather quirky. Eventually,
    I tried out Red Hat Linux and stuck to that, as it just gave me no grief; and
    I, like most others, do not need any more grief than necessary.

    Hat Linux，并坚持使用它，因为它没有给我带来任何麻烦；就像大多数人一样，我不需要比必要的更多麻烦。
- en: I started off with my three desktop machines at work and home set up as dual-boot
    systems running both Linux and Windows, but I gradually found myself using only
    Linux. Although I had expected to encounter numerous limitations in Linux that
    would force me to return to Windows often, I instead found that I had actually
    increased my productivity. Other than lack of native support for Windows streaming
    media, I was actually able to do more due to the extensive software base that
    was now installed on my machine. Without having to fork out money that I could
    ill afford to spend, I was able to manipulate my digital images, rip songs from
    CDs, create vector drawings, create PDF files, and do a variety of other things
    that I wasn’t able to do under Windows. It was only a matter of a little time
    before my dual-boot setups became full Linux-only setups. I ceased to be a Windows
    user.

  zh: 我开始时在我的三个桌面机器（工作和家中）上设置了双启动系统，运行 Linux 和 Windows，但渐渐地我发现我只在使用 Linux。虽然我预计会在
    Linux 中遇到许多限制，迫使我经常回到 Windows，但我实际上发现我的生产力实际上提高了。除了缺乏对 Windows 流媒体的原生支持外，由于现在机器上安装了广泛的软件库，我实际上能够做更多的事情。无需花费我难以承受的钱，我能够处理我的数字图像，从
    CD 中抓取歌曲，创建矢量图形，创建 PDF 文件，以及做许多在 Windows 下无法完成的事情。我的双启动设置很快就变成了全 Linux 设置。我不再是
    Windows 用户了。
- en: Of course, during the course of my adjusting to the Linux environment, I had
    to learn a lot. I was, after all, alone in a sea of Windows users with a Mac island
    or two on the horizon. What I needed to know I had to find out on my own. The
    basics, of course, were quite easy, as intuition alone seemed to be enough; but,
    just as with other operating systems, I had to resort to doing some research to
    learn to do other things. Given the baffling geek-oriented nature of most Linux
    books at the time, I had to turn to mailing lists, bulletin boards, and the ol’
    proven and true system of trial and error. As my memory has never been that good,
    I kept notes of what I had to do in order to get something done so that I could
    do it again in the future.

  zh: 当然，在我适应 Linux 环境的过程中，我不得不学习很多东西。毕竟，我身处 Windows 用户的大海中，周围只有几个 Mac 岛屿。我需要知道的一切，我必须自己去找出来。当然，基础的东西相当简单，因为直觉似乎就足够了；但是，就像其他操作系统一样，我不得不做一些研究来学习做其他事情。鉴于当时大多数
    Linux 书籍令人困惑的极客导向性质，我不得不求助于邮件列表、公告板和古老的、经过验证的试错系统。由于我的记忆力一直不太好，我记下了完成某事所需做的步骤，以便将来再次完成。
- en: The idea of writing a book, however, came a bit later. In fact, the inspiration
    for the book was, of all people, my mother. My mother had been using an old Windows
    95 machine of mine for years, but it was reaching the end of its days. My mother,
    being retired and of fixed income, found buying a new machine a bit beyond her
    means, so I told her I would send her one of my extra machines. The only problem
    was that she didn’t have any software or even a system to put on the machine.
    All she had on her old machine was what I had installed long, long ago, and the
    installation disks were mere memories.

  zh: 然而，写书的想法来得稍晚一些。事实上，这本书的灵感来自于我母亲。我的母亲多年来一直在使用我的一台旧 Windows 95 机器，但它已经接近寿命的尽头。由于母亲已经退休，收入固定，她觉得买一台新机器有点超出她的能力范围，所以我告诉她我会给她送一台我的备用机器。唯一的问题是，她没有软件，甚至没有系统可以安装到机器上。她旧机器上只有我多年前安装的东西，安装盘也只是一些记忆。
- en: Buying new copies of Windows, Microsoft Office, and all the other odds and ends
    that she had grown accustomed to would cost a fortune, so I thought that perhaps
    I might just set up the machine with a Red Hat Linux system. Of course, I worried
    at first whether my 72-year-old mother was ready for entry into the Linux world.
    Thinking of my own experiences, however, I couldn’t really see any reason why
    she wouldn’t be. After all, she could handle her mouse as well as the next person,
    and the process of installing Linux had improved so much from the days when I
    got started that it had essentially become a no-brainer. Yes, with a set of decent
    instructions that a beginner could understand, she would do all right.

  zh: 买新的 Windows、Microsoft Office 和她习惯的其他各种小玩意儿将花费一大笔钱，所以我考虑或许我可以用 Red Hat Linux
    系统来设置这台机器。当然，一开始我担心我 72 岁的母亲是否准备好进入 Linux 世界。然而，想到自己的经历，我实在想不出她为什么不能。毕竟，她使用鼠标的能力不亚于其他人，而且
    Linux 的安装过程从我开始的时候已经改善了很多，几乎变成了一个不费脑力的过程。是的，如果有一套初学者也能理解的 decent 指令，她会做得不错的。
- en: 'I told her what I was going to do, and she seemed receptive enough; however,
    when she said that she would go out and buy a book to get her ready, and asked
    me for suggestions, I was stumped. Having gone through many a book myself as I
    got started up with Linux, I couldn’t think of a single one that would be of any
    use to someone like her. Most books then, and even now, tended to follow a similar
    format: They started with a rudimentary gloss over the basics of installation
    and usage, and then they suddenly leaped into geek mode, discussing everything
    in terms of commands and focusing excessively on topics that the average user
    would be intimidated by (and have little, if any, use for), such as setting up
    servers. It seemed to me that such books would just confuse her or, worse yet,
    scare her away. After all, that was what they did to me. I therefore decided to
    just write up a set of instructions myself — instructions that even my mother
    could understand and have some fun with. When my auntie got a hold of the instructions,
    the power of Zeus took hold in her, bringing about her simple edict: “Publish
    it!” And that is what “inspired” me to take that set of instructions and my notes
    to myself to the next level and write this book. One must not fly in the face
    of the power of Zeus . . . or my auntie.'

  zh: 我告诉她我打算做什么，她似乎很感兴趣；然而，当她说她会出去买一本书来做好准备，并问我有什么建议时，我感到困惑。在我开始使用Linux的过程中，我已经读过很多本书，但我实在想不出哪一本对她这样的人会有任何帮助。那时的大多数书籍，甚至现在，都倾向于遵循类似的格式：它们从对安装和使用的最基本知识进行粗略的概述开始，然后突然跳入技术模式，用命令行术语讨论一切，过度关注普通用户可能会感到害怕（而且几乎没有用途）的话题，比如设置服务器。在我看来，这样的书籍只会让她感到困惑，或者更糟，让她望而却步。毕竟，它们就是这样对我做的。因此，我决定自己编写一套指令——即使是我的母亲也能理解并从中获得乐趣。当我的阿姨拿到这些指令时，宙斯的权力在她身上显现，她发出了简单的命令：“出版它！”这就是“启发”我把那套指令和我自己的笔记提升到下一个层次，并写这本书的原因。一个人不应该与宙斯的权力相抗衡……或者我的阿姨的权力。

- en: There is yet another type of user I had in mind, and I suppose I could call
    them the on-the-fence type. The on-the-fence users are not really users at all.
    They are people who have read or heard about Linux and are wondering whether or
    not they are ready to deal with it, perhaps being held back by the Linux-is-for-geeks
    stereotype. These on-the-fencers need a reason to make the switch and a bit of
