- en: My own computing life began long ago in the Commodore/Atari days. The purchase
    of my first machine, no doubt inspired by Alan Alda’s television commercials at
    the time, was an Atari XL600 with a cassette drive for storage, and 16KB of RAM
    — more than I thought I would ever need at the time (ha!).

- en: Most of my time on that machine, I must admit, was spent playing cartridge-
    based games and typing in pages and pages of machine code from the now-defunct
    magazine *Antic* to create even more games. Eventually, my interest in computers
    increased, especially after seeing my first, and actually *the* first, Macintosh
    at the UCLA bookstore. The very in-your-face nature of the Mac’s operating system
    caused me to become an operating-system maniac. To date I have worked with almost
    every operating system there is or ever was, including Mac operating systems up
    to and including OS X, every Windows version from 3.1 to XP, and even IBM’s much
    forgotten OS/2.

- en: Though tempted to join the Linux fray, I continued to steer away from it for
    a long time, because I could not help but see it, as so many others do, as a system
    for never-seen-the-light-of-day-faced, late-night Dr. Pepper–drinking, Domino’s-
    pizza-eating compu-geeks. Moving to Japan and being surrounded with machines loaded
    with Japanese versions of Windows, however, presented me with numerous problems,
    such as language constraints. As everything, including help files, was written
    in Japanese, I ended up using only a fraction of the full potential of most software.
    Then there were those annoying Windows-type problems, such as the constant freezes
    and restarts, and the gradual system slowdowns, which were eventually only remedied
    by reinstalling the system. Getting the software I needed to do the things I wanted
    to do also took its toll on my wallet, and I began to rethink my initial resistance
    to Linux. With Linux’s multilingual support, system stability, and extensive and
    free software packages, there were plenty of incentives for me to get over my
    obsession with the stereotypical Linux user.

- en: After a few failed attempts at getting Linux to work on the oddball Frankenstein-like
    collection of junk that was my computer, I finally succeeded the safe way with
    a CD-based Knoppix distribution, which worked well enough to hook me in a little
    further. I then moved on to Mandrake, as that was claimed to be the most newbie-friendly
    version, and then tried out SuSE as well, which I found rather quirky. Eventually,
    I tried out Red Hat Linux and stuck to that, as it just gave me no grief; and
    I, like most others, do not need any more grief than necessary.

- en: I started off with my three desktop machines at work and home set up as dual-boot
    systems running both Linux and Windows, but I gradually found myself using only
    Linux. Although I had expected to encounter numerous limitations in Linux that
    would force me to return to Windows often, I instead found that I had actually
    increased my productivity. Other than lack of native support for Windows streaming
    media, I was actually able to do more due to the extensive software base that
    was now installed on my machine. Without having to fork out money that I could
    ill afford to spend, I was able to manipulate my digital images, rip songs from
    CDs, create vector drawings, create PDF files, and do a variety of other things
    that I wasn’t able to do under Windows. It was only a matter of a little time
    before my dual-boot setups became full Linux-only setups. I ceased to be a Windows
    user.

- en: Of course, during the course of my adjusting to the Linux environment, I had
    to learn a lot. I was, after all, alone in a sea of Windows users with a Mac island
    or two on the horizon. What I needed to know I had to find out on my own. The
    basics, of course, were quite easy, as intuition alone seemed to be enough; but,
    just as with other operating systems, I had to resort to doing some research to
    learn to do other things. Given the baffling geek-oriented nature of most Linux
    books at the time, I had to turn to mailing lists, bulletin boards, and the ol’
    proven and true system of trial and error. As my memory has never been that good,
    I kept notes of what I had to do in order to get something done so that I could
    do it again in the future.

- en: The idea of writing a book, however, came a bit later. In fact, the inspiration
    for the book was, of all people, my mother. My mother had been using an old Windows
    95 machine of mine for years, but it was reaching the end of its days. My mother,
    being retired and of fixed income, found buying a new machine a bit beyond her
    means, so I told her I would send her one of my extra machines. The only problem
    was that she didn’t have any software or even a system to put on the machine.
    All she had on her old machine was what I had installed long, long ago, and the
    installation disks were mere memories.

- en: Buying new copies of Windows, Microsoft Office, and all the other odds and ends
    that she had grown accustomed to would cost a fortune, so I thought that perhaps
    I might just set up the machine with a Red Hat Linux system. Of course, I worried
    at first whether my 72-year-old mother was ready for entry into the Linux world.
    Thinking of my own experiences, however, I couldn’t really see any reason why
    she wouldn’t be. After all, she could handle her mouse as well as the next person,
    and the process of installing Linux had improved so much from the days when I
    got started that it had essentially become a no-brainer. Yes, with a set of decent
    instructions that a beginner could understand, she would do all right.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I told her what I was going to do, and she seemed receptive enough; however,
    when she said that she would go out and buy a book to get her ready, and asked
    me for suggestions, I was stumped. Having gone through many a book myself as I
    got started up with Linux, I couldn’t think of a single one that would be of any
    use to someone like her. Most books then, and even now, tended to follow a similar
    format: They started with a rudimentary gloss over the basics of installation
    and usage, and then they suddenly leaped into geek mode, discussing everything
    in terms of commands and focusing excessively on topics that the average user
    would be intimidated by (and have little, if any, use for), such as setting up
    servers. It seemed to me that such books would just confuse her or, worse yet,
    scare her away. After all, that was what they did to me. I therefore decided to
    just write up a set of instructions myself — instructions that even my mother
    could understand and have some fun with. When my auntie got a hold of the instructions,
    the power of Zeus took hold in her, bringing about her simple edict: “Publish
    it!” And that is what “inspired” me to take that set of instructions and my notes
    to myself to the next level and write this book. One must not fly in the face
    of the power of Zeus . . . or my auntie.'

- en: As you can surmise from the background you’ve just read, I wrote this book so
    that a total non-geek, such as my mother, could use a pretty standard Linux distribution
    without much in the way of pain and grief. Of course, you may be wondering who
    qualifies as a non-geek, so I will try to clarify the several types I had in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first type, the Mom group, consists of users who really don’t know much
    about computers other than how to use them for writing letters, sending email,
    and browsing the Web. Such users just want to be able to use their Fedora system
    in much the same way they had used their Mac or Windows systems, and to have a
    bit of fun along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other type, the me-and-my-friends type, consists of those users who are
    a bit more adept at using computers but are also new to Linux, and thus want to
    know how to get things done in the manner they are accustomed to, while at the
    same time wishing to learn just enough more so that they have a foundation on
    which to go further and push the envelope just a bit — the want-to-get-their-feeta-little-geeky
    types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is yet another type of user I had in mind, and I suppose I could call
    them the on-the-fence type. The on-the-fence users are not really users at all.
    They are people who have read or heard about Linux and are wondering whether or
    not they are ready to deal with it, perhaps being held back by the Linux-is-for-geeks
    stereotype. These on-the-fencers need a reason to make the switch and a bit of
    reassurance that they will be all right once they do. To such folks, I can say
    right now, cliché though it may be, c’mon in — the water’s fine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of this is to say that this book is pretty much for the average desktop
    computer user — someone who wants to use their computer for home- and even work-oriented
    productivity, music, art, and most importantly, fun. As such, there is no discussion
    of setting up a server or anything of that ilk. When and if you become interested
    in such things, you will have a lot of resources to turn to, and you will be well
    prepared to do so once you’ve read this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, I try to explain how to do things within the framework of the comforting
    graphical interface. To the degree that it is necessary or might be of interest
    to those push-the-envelope-a-little types, I also provide a brief, though detailed,
    explanation of how to use the command line, with much handholding along the way.
    This may even be of interest to someone with some previous experience with Fedora
    Core or Red Hat Linux, or to a migrant from another Linux distribution.

- en: As a language teacher, I have always preferred programming books, mathematics
    books, and old-fashioned foreign-language-learning texts because of their straightforward,
    skill-based orientation, in which each chapter builds upon the skills acquired
    in the [previous chapter](DDU0001.html#2). I have tried to organize this book
    in that manner so that you will never be called upon to do something that you
    have not already learned. I also like such books because they not only teach the
    reader how to do something, but also provide him or her with the chance to put
    those morsels of knowledge into practice in the form of exercises. I have therefore
    included several exercises, or projects, in this book, where appropriate, to give
    the reader opportunities to apply their knowledge. This book will serve as a reference
    text and will also provide a dynamic learning experience, so that you can learn
    by doing, as they say.

- en: It is possible, of course, to use this book as a mere reference text that you
    only consult when you have a problem to solve, but that would negate the basic
    concept behind the design of the book. Instead, I recommend that you first go
    through the entire book chapter by chapter, doing the projects along the way.
    This will give you a much broader understanding of how things are done (and of
    how you can get things done), and it will reduce the chance for anxiety, confusion,
    and, worse yet, mistakes.

- en: Of course, it is best to read this book and complete its projects when you are
    relaxed and have time to spare. Nothing makes things go wrong more than doing
    things in a rush. And keep in mind that Linux and the projects in this book are
    fun, not just challenging work exercises. The whole point of the Linux world,
    in my opinion, is that it offers all kinds of fun. So, go ahead and enjoy it.

    used in the book. Words that you need to pay particular attention to, such as
    file or folder names that you will actually be called upon to use, I have put
    in **bold** type. Any words or command strings that you will have to type on the
    keyboard are shown in monospace font, while any output from the Linux command
    terminal, the application you use when you want to type in commands, is indicated
    by **bold monospace**. I have also opted to use the more graphically suggestive
    term *folder* instead of *directory* — no doubt the legacy of my many years as
    a Mac user.
