- en: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a TCP-based protocol used to
    access directory services. Directory services provide users with information about
    other users and resources within a network (usually in the form of address book
    entries). Entries are stored in a central database and accessed from an LDAP server
    (OpenLDAP, Windows Server Active Directory, etc.) via an LDAP-capable client (Microsoft
    Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc.).

- en: OpenLDAP complies with the X.500 series of directory services standards developed
    by the ITU-T (the standards division of the International Telecommunication Union).
    This provides LDAP interoperability between X.500-based applications.

- en: A company named Net Boolean Inc. was formed to provide email services for businesses
    in early 1998\. Available commercial LDAP implementations were too expensive for
    this young company. Net Boolean created Boolean LDAP from open source LDAP software
    made available by the University of Michigan. Kurt Zeilenga of Net Boolean later
    founded the OpenLDAP Foundation and the project in August of 1998\. Current OpenLDAP
    development consists of a core team that includes founder Kurt Zeilenga, Howard
    Chu, and Pierangelo Masarati.
