    good news is that Linux can match anything that your previous operating system
    could do online, and in many cases it can do it faster or more easily. Ubuntu
    was born on the Web, so it should be no surprise that it comes with a very healthy

    worlds. Chances are you are already a Firefox user, but if you’re not, no worries.
    Things work more or less the same in all browsers, so you should be able to use
    Firefox’s basic features without any instruction. Of course, some of its features
    do distinguish Firefox from its competition, so I will mention those.

    window. On some pages, links are coded so that the new page opens in a new, separate
    window, or maybe you occasionally opt for opening a link in a new window by right-clicking
    the link and then selecting the Open Link in New Window option. This can be very

    of hard to find what you’re looking for. It can also slow things down a bit.

    in the Launcher (shown in [Figure 5-1](ch05.html#the_firefox_icon_in_the_launcher

    Firefox will perform searches for keywords entered in the search box using Google.
    You can, if you like, select other search engines or search particular websites
    by clicking the colored *g* icon in the search box and then making your selection.
    Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! are available, to name a few, and you can even add
    others. For now, however, let’s stick to Google by typing nyckelharpa in that
    search box. Once you’ve finished typing, press enter. A page of search results
    should appear in the main pane of the Firefox window.

    select **Open Link in New Tab**. You can, if you prefer, make things a tad easier
    and dispense with the pop-up menu selection step by simply clicking the link with
    the middle mouse button (or with both mouse buttons simultaneously) or by holding

    that the page has been saved. But saved where, you ask? Go to the Bookmarks menu

    One of these, Most Visited, contains a list of the websites that you visit most
    frequently. Simply click **Most Visited**, choose one of the sites from the list
    that pops up, and you’ll be taken directly to one of your favorite sites. The
    second item is a link to some instructions on “Getting Started,” which you may
    wish to peruse later. For now, let’s concentrate on populating the Bookmarks toolbar

    the first place. That’s all well and good if a website strikes you as worth keeping
    for later when you first visit it, but what if you found something a few days
    ago that seems important only in retrospect? For just such eventualities, Firefox
    keeps a detailed history of all of the websites you’ve visited over the last few
    months, or even longer. To view your web-browsing history, click **View** ▸ **Sidebar**
    and select **History** or press ctrl-H. This will bring up the *History sidebar*,
    which has a full list of websites you’ve visited, sorted by date. You can browse
    or search through these, just as you could with the Bookmarks toolbar. Clicking
    any of the pages in the list will bring it up in the main Firefox window again.

    find a previously viewed website isn’t everyone’s idea of fun. To this end, Firefox
    has what I think you’ll agree is a rather awesome feature: the Awesome Bar. This
    is actually just another name for the address bar, which might leave you with
    the impression that there’s perhaps more to the dull old text box than meets the
    eye. Indeed, there is: Open a new tab and start typing. As the letters appear
    in the address bar, a list will appear immediately below it, containing links
    to websites that you’ve previously visited (shown in [Figure 5-7](ch05.html#the_awesome_bar_comma_showing_items_from

    Firefox is directly searching your web history as you type, finding anything that
    matches what you’ve entered in the address bar. Refine the search by typing a
    few more letters or scroll down through the list until you find the website you’re
    looking for. With a single click, the page will load, negating any need to type
    its address out in full. Slick, no? You can also use the up and down arrow keys
    on the keyboard to select items from the list and use the enter key to visit the
    page that is currently highlighted—no clicking required.'

    a search instead, just as if you had typed those words into the search box to
    the right. While it might take a little time to get used to how the Awesome Bar

    at least for a time, then you can try *Private Browsing mode*. This is handy if
    you want to look at something confidential, such as a banking website. Click **Tools**
    ▸ **Start Private Browsing** and start surfing—Firefox will instantly forget any
    and all of the pages that you visit while private browsing is enabled, and they
    won’t appear in your web history or otherwise. When you want to return Firefox
    to its normal operation, simply go back to the Tools menu and click **Stop Private
    Browsing**. The window will return to whatever state it was in before you started
    private browsing, without any trace to be seen of the websites you just visited.

    Thunderbird email client")) is Ubuntu’s default email application. It is very
    straightforward to use, and it includes most of the most important email functions
    you’ve come to expect, such as junk mail filters. In fact, it’s somewhat similar
    to Windows Mail in terms of appearance and handling. The fact that Thunderbird
    is also available in both Mac and Windows versions means that you may already
    be familiar with it.

    Setup window, which asks for a few basic details about your email account. Enter
    your name, your email address, and the password for your email account and click
    **Continue** to proceed. Now, exactly what happens when you enter your information
    in this window will be quite specific to your individual circumstances. If you
    have an email account with one of the big email providers, like Gmail, Hotmail,
    or Yahoo!, Thunderbird will automatically set up your email account with the minimum
    of fuss, updating the Mail Account Setup screen with only a couple of additional
    questions. If you use a lesser-known provider, such as your workplace’s Exchange
    email server, however, you’ll have to enter a few more details to get things up
    and running. Fortunately, Thunderbird is one of the most popular email applications
    out there, so most email providers will have detailed instructions on how to get
    it working posted somewhere on their website.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve entered the details demanded of you, or followed the instructions
    of your email service provider, click **Create Account**. Thunderbird will start
    updating, checking your email account for new messages, and so forth. You’ll notice
    that a few email-related folders appear in the bar on the left side of the screen,
    such as an Inbox and Sent Mail and Drafts folders. From here on, it’s pretty much
    business as usual; you can do the same things that you’d do with any other email
    client. From the toolbar at the top of the Thunderbird window, you can click **Get
    Mail** to retrieve any unread messages from your email provider or click **Write**
    to start composing a new message. There’s also an Address Book for managing your
    contacts and a handy search feature that you can use to find messages. As I mentioned,
    Thunderbird has a lot of other features; going into them all here would be somewhat
    time-consuming, so I’ll leave it to you to explore for yourself. You might like
    to check out Thunderbird’s excellent help and support website, which can be found
    at [http://support.mozillamessaging.com/](http://support.mozillamessaging.com/).
    In addition to troubleshooting advice, it has a number of guides to help you get
    started and information about everything that Thunderbird is capable of.

    of communication-related apps into one neat interface. See the envelope icon toward
    the right end of the panel at the top of the screen? This is the Messaging Menu
    ([Figure 5-17](ch05.html#the_messaging_menu_comma_accessed_by_cli "Figure 5-17. The
    Messaging Menu, accessed by clicking the envelope icon")). Click it, and you’ll
    find entries for email, chat, and “broadcast,” which refers to social media and
    microblogging services like Twitter and Facebook. You can use the Messaging Menu
    to do all sorts of things—compose a new email, start a chat, update your Twitter
    status. In short, use it for anything to do with communicating with the outside
    world. You’ll find out more about the chat and broadcast options shortly, but
    for now, let’s take a look at how the Messaging Menu handles email.

    the envelope icon on the top panel will change color from white to blue. When
    this happens, click the envelope to display the Messaging Menu, and you’ll find
    a summary of how many new emails you have at the bottom of the menu. This is especially
    handy if you have multiple email accounts; a breakdown of how many new emails
    you have in each account will be shown, and clicking the menu item for an account
    will bring up the new emails in Thunderbird. The Messaging Menu also has shortcuts
    so that you can quickly access your list of contacts or compose a new email. All
    in all, very convenient, as I’m sure you’ll agree.

    a message and getting a response. What if you just fancy a quick chat? That’s
    where *instant messaging (IM)* comes in. If you’re not familiar with the concept,
    all you do is find your friend on an IM network and type a short message to him.
    Your message will show up on his screen in the blink of an eye. He can then reply
    to it, and you receive the reply just as quickly. So it continues, until you say
    goodbye and disconnect from the network.
