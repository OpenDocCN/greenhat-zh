It will also work with AMD64 or Intel Core 2 processors, albeit not in 64-bit mode. In order to use Ubuntu with these processors (or any other machine based on AMD64 or EM64T architecture) in 64-bit mode, you must get a different disc on your own. There are several ways of doing this: downloading an ISO (disc image) and then burning it to CD yourself, ordering the CD from Ubuntu (for free), or ordering it from an online Linux CD provider (for a nominal cost).</p><div class="sect1" title="Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to CD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="downloading_and_burning_ubuntu_desktop_c"/>Downloading and Burning Ubuntu Desktop CD ISOs to CD</h1></div></div></div><p>To download an ISO of the Ubuntu Desktop CD, go to the Ubuntu website at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a>, find the link to the download page, and then select and download the appropriate version for your machine. Remember that the ISO file you will be downloading is a heavyweight, weighing in at just under 700MB, so the download will take a bit of time. Don't count on getting it all downloaded and done before dinner . . . or, if you happen to be using a dial-up Internet connection, before dinner tomorrow.

Although Windows has built-in CD-writing capabilities, not all versions have the built-in ability to burn ISOs. To burn an ISO to CD in Windows 7, just right-click the ISO file, select <span class="strong"><strong>Burn disc image</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button in the window that appears. In all other versions of Windows, however, you must use a third-party commercial application, such as Nero. If you don't have a commercial disc-burning utility installed on your system, try the free and handy ISO Recorder.<a id="IDX-APP-B-1905" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1906" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1907" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1908" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1909" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1903" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1904" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1910" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1911" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To get ISO Recorder, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</a>. Once the download is complete, double-click the <span class="emphasis"><em>ISORecorderSetup.msi</em></span> file on your hard disk to install it. After the installation is complete, burn your ISO to CD by right-clicking the Ubuntu ISO file on your machine and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Open with</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>ISO Recorder</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. A CD Recording Wizard window will appear.</p><p>It is generally best if you burn installation or live CDs at a lower speed than the maximum speed allowed by your drive in order to reduce the chance of error (with 2X to 4X speeds considered optimal). To do so, make your choice from the Recording speed drop-down menu. Next, pop a blank CD into the drive, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button. The CD-burning process should begin. Once it's done, the CD should pop out of the drive, and if all goes well, you'll have yourself an AMD64-compatible live CD. You can then use it by following the directions at the beginning of <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. WADING AND DIVING">Chapter 2</a> for using the live CD that comes with this book.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If your CD does not seem to work, there could be a problem with the ISO file you downloaded. Find out by doing an integrity check as explained at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM/</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Burning the ISO to CD in OS X"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="burning_the_iso_to_cd_in_os_x"/>Burning the ISO to CD in OS X</h2></div></div></div><p>Although Ubuntu no longer comes in PowerPC editions, the i386 editions can be installed and run on Intel-based Macs. You can also, of course, download ISOs for other architectures on your Mac and then burn them to CD for use on other machines.</p><p>To burn an ISO file to CD in OS X, first check to make sure the ISO image is not mounted by opening a Finder window and checking the disc in the area at the top portion of the left pane. If the disc is mounted, a drive icon will appear in that location. If the drive icon is there, click the arrow next to that entry to eject, or <span class="emphasis"><em>unmount</em></span>, it.</p><p>After that, click <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> in the same Finder window, and then look for and open the <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> folder. In that folder, find and then double-click <span class="strong"><strong>Disk Utility</strong></span>. If the ISO is not listed in the left pane of the Disk Utility window when it opens, go back to the Finder window, locate the Ubuntu Live CD ISO you just downloaded, and then drag it to the left pane of the Disk Utility window, just below the listings for your current drives. Once the ISO file appears in that list, click it once to highlight it.</p><p>To complete the process, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> icon in the Disk Utility window's toolbar, and then insert a blank CD in your drive when prompted to do so. Once the blank disc is inserted and recognized, you will be able to adjust the burn speed from the drop-down menu next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Speed</em></span>. Select as low a speed as your hardware will allow, which, depending on the age of your Mac, will probably be 4X to 8X. Finally, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Burn</strong></span> button in that same window, and the burning process will begin.</p></div></div></div>

Of course, the only downside to this approach is time. It can take up to ten weeks for you to get the CDs in this manner, so if you're impatient, you might want to opt for one of the other methods. To order your install CDs from Ubuntu, go to <a class="ulink" href="https://shipit.ubuntu.com/">https://shipit.ubuntu.com/</a>, and follow the directions there. It's easy.<a id="IDX-APP-B-1912" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1913" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1914" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1915" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-1916" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you need faster service or larger numbers of Ubuntu CDs and don't mind paying a small amount for the service, then you can order your discs through the Canonical store instead (<a class="ulink" href="https://shop.canonical.com/">https://shop.canonical.com/</a>).</p></div>
