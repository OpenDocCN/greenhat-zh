- en: Ruby is “a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
    and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to
    write.”^([[1](#ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-1)]) It was released in 1995 by Yukihiro “Matz”
    Matsumoto. It is often described as either a very high-level language or a scripting
    language, depending on whom you ask. As such, it doesn’t require a programmer
    to specify the details of how the computer implements your decisions. Like other
    high-level languages, Ruby is often used in text-processing applications, including
    an increasing number of web applications. I hope that once you’ve become more
    acquainted with the language, you’ll agree that it does a good job of getting
    out of your way and simply letting you get some work done.

- en: Ruby has a very interesting pedigree. Matz himself has said that the two most
    influential languages on Ruby’s design were Common Lisp and Smalltalk—they were
    so influential, in fact, that he has jokingly referred to Ruby as *MatzLisp*.
    On the other hand, some Ruby aficionados stress Ruby’s similarities with Smalltalk
    and Perl, as did David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Rails, in a June 2006 *Linux
    Journal* interview. Hansson also describes Ruby as “a language for writing beautiful
    code that makes programmers happy.” I couldn’t agree more.^([[2](#ftn.PREF-00-FNOTE-2)])

    Ruby Shell (irb) that we’ll use in the next chapter. If you’ve installed Ruby
    with a package manager, irb may come in a separate package, possibly with a specific
    version number as a part of the package name.

    up-to-date version than what your package manager offers, you can simply browse
    to [http://www.ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and click the Download
    Ruby link. Download the current stable release (1.8.4 at the time of this writing),
    which is a .tar.gz file. Then type the following commands as the superuser, also
    called `root`. (I’ll assume you’re using version 1.8.4, although it will probably
    be a later version when you download Ruby.)

    At the time of this writing, it included the base language with various popular
    extensions, including SciTE (a syntax-highlighting text editor), FreeRIDE (a Ruby
    development environment), a help file containing Dave Thomas’ book *Programming
    Ruby* (also called The Pickaxe), and the RubyGems package installer. It also comes
    with irb, which we’ll explore in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Interactive

    paradigms and their impact on both language design and language use—topics common
    to academic programming books. These days, you can use any popular language for
    most tasks, but that doesn’t mean that solving a given problem will be equally
    painless in every language. No language exists in a vacuum, and a discussion of
    a language like Ruby should acknowledge the decisions that went into its design.
    You’ll find that it’s a very flexible language that lets you combine different
    approaches in powerful ways. Biologists recognize hybrid vigor; so did Matz when
    he created Ruby.
