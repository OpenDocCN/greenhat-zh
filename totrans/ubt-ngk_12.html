Still, as is the case for most computer users, what I usually end up doing on my computer is work, and writing this book falls into that category.<a id="IDX-CHP-11-1123" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Fortunately, Linux can get down to business and do it as well as the next OS. I think it's safe to say that you are missing nothing and are probably gaining quite a bit in terms of home and office productivity programs in the world of Linux. In this chapter, I'll walk you through the Linux offerings in this department.</p><div class="sect1" title="OpenOffice.org"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="openoffice.org"/>OpenOffice.org</h1></div></div></div><p>Whether they should be or not, people are quite obsessed with office suites, even though most people seldom need more than a word processor. The de facto standard among office suites is Microsoft Office, which is available in both the Windows and Macintosh worlds. Of course, because it is a Microsoft product, you can be quite sure that no Linux version is available.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1124" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1125" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Fortunately, Linux does have an exceedingly capable office suite in the form of OpenOffice.org, which is, incidentally, also freely available (as in <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>) in Windows and Mac OS X versions. OpenOffice.org is not some lightweight sour-grapes substitute for the Microsoft Office–less Linux world; it is a full-featured contender, and in some cases, OpenOffice.org is a clear winner.</p><div class="sect2" title="OpenOffice.org Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="openoffice.org_applications"/>OpenOffice.org Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>The entire OpenOffice.org office suite consists of a number of application modules, and the most commonly used ones come bundled with Ubuntu. These include a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), and a presentation creator and player (Impress), all of which you can find by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Office</strong></span>. In addition, there is a very handy vector drawing program (Draw), which you'll find by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics</strong></span>. The database module (Base) and the mathematical formula editor (Math), though no longer packaged with Ubuntu, are still available as separate downloads via Ubuntu Software Center (by searching for and marking <span class="emphasis"><em>openoffice.org-base</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>openoffice.org-math</em></span>, respectively).<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1126" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1127" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1128" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1129" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1130" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1131" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1132" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since giving full and detailed instructions on how to use each of these applications would take up an entire book (and there are entire books on the subject), I will simply introduce each module to you.</p><div class="sect3" title="Writer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="writer"/>Writer</h3></div></div></div><p>As I mentioned earlier, the word processor is the office application that the majority of users turn to most often. Fortunately, OpenOffice.org Writer is a good one (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#openoffice.org_writer" title="Figure 12-1. OpenOffice.org Writer">Figure 12-1</a>). It is chock-full of features and can read and save Microsoft Word files. Like Word, it will even let you save your documents as HTML files so that you can easily change your documents into web pages.</p><p>As I said, Writer is a very straightforward word processor, so I won't go on about it, but if you would like an introduction to using Writer (or the other OpenOffice.org modules), check out the various tutorials and other resources available at <a class="ulink" href="http://support.openoffice.org/">http://support.openoffice.org/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Calc"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="calc"/>Calc</h3></div></div></div><p>Calc is the OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application, and it is similar to Excel in terms of capabilities and general layout (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#a_graph_created_in_openoffice.org_calc" title="Figure 12-2. A graph created in OpenOffice.org Calc">Figure 12-2</a>). It can also, quite importantly, read and save Microsoft Excel files.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1133" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1134" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1135" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Since most people who use spreadsheets generally understand what they are all about and, after a bit of poking around, can figure out how to use them, I won't go into any sort of primer about using Calc. However, because there are many others who don't see any need to even try using spreadsheets, I will mention a few of the simpler tasks that can be done with Calc, in the hope of enticing some of you into trying it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="openoffice.org_writer"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17508"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656471.png.jpg" alt="OpenOffice.org Writer"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-1. OpenOffice.org Writer</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="a_graph_created_in_openoffice.org_calc"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17516"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656473.png.jpg" alt="A graph created in OpenOffice.org Calc"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-2. A graph created in OpenOffice.org Calc</p></div><p>Most people who don't use spreadsheets think of them as sort of giant calculators used for computing uncomfortably large sets of numbers, such as payrolls (which was the original purpose of such applications). That's right, of course, but spreadsheets can be used for everyday tasks too, such as projecting household budgets, calculating grade point averages (by teachers or students), figuring out how long it will take you to save up for your trip to Hungary, or even comparing the seat heights for the four or five motorcycles you are trying to choose among. And when doing any of these minor mathematical tasks, you can easily create graphs in order to make all the abstract numbers speak to you visually.</p><p>If numbers are just not your thing, you can still use Calc for creating lists of information, such as birthday lists, class rosters, shopping lists, address lists . . . whatever. You can even have Calc put the lists into alphabetical order, sort them by date of birth, and so on. Everyone eventually seems to find some use for Calc, so don't ignore it entirely.</p><p>And if you are still not convinced that Calc has a place in your life, you might at least find some amusement from an Easter egg hidden within the program, which allows you to play a Space Invaders clone called Star-Wars (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#space_invaders_in_openoffice.org_calc_qu" title="Figure 12-3. Space Invaders in OpenOffice.org Calc? Yup.">Figure 12-3</a>). Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>=GAME("StarWars")</code></strong> into any cell in Calc, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The instructions are in German, but it should be easy enough to figure out how to play even if you don't remember any of your high-school Deutsch.</p><div class="figure"><a id="space_invaders_in_openoffice.org_calc_qu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17538"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656475.png.jpg" alt="Space Invaders in OpenOffice.org Calc?

Yup.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Impress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="impress"/>Impress</h3></div></div></div><p>Impress is OpenOffice.org's answer to Microsoft's PowerPoint, with which it is compatible. It allows you to create attractive slides for use in presentations and also allows you to create notes or handouts to accompany them. Although these features make Impress quite handy in business and education settings, you may not find as much value in it as a home user.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1137" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1138" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1139" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1140" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1141" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1136" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1142" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Draw"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="draw"/>Draw</h3></div></div></div><p>More useful to the home user is OpenOffice.org Draw. Although Draw isn't great for creating true graphics in the artistic sense, it is very useful for creating flowcharts, organizational diagrams (such as seating arrangements for wedding receptions or conferences), or any other document in which you want a bit more control over the placement of text and graphics (especially when the two are combined), such as fliers, awards, diagrams, and newsletters. In this sense, Draw can be used quite effectively as a simple page layout program, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#a_newsletter_created_open_parenthesis_an" title="Figure 12-4. A newsletter created (and displayed) in OpenOffice.org Draw">Figure 12-4</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1143" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="a_newsletter_created_open_parenthesis_an"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17588"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656477.png.jpg" alt="A newsletter created (and displayed) in OpenOffice.org Draw"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-4. A newsletter created (and displayed) in OpenOffice.org Draw</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org File Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="microsoft_office_and_openoffice.org_file"/>Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org File Compatibility</h2></div></div></div><p>Although I mention the point throughout this section, it is worthwhile to reemphasize that OpenOffice.org can read and write Microsoft Office files. This compatibility is quite good, though tables sometimes prove slightly problematic.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1144" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To read Microsoft Office files, all you need to do is double-click the file in question, and it will open in the appropriate OpenOffice.org module. When saving files within OpenOffice.org to use within earlier versions of Microsoft Office, however, you must save them into the appropriate format, because OpenOffice.org will otherwise save files into its native format (<span class="emphasis"><em>.odt</em></span> for Writer documents, <span class="emphasis"><em>.ods</em></span> for Calc documents, and <span class="emphasis"><em>.odp</em></span> for Impress documents) by default, and only the most recent versions of Office can deal with these files.</p><p>To do this when saving a file, click the small <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> next to the words <span class="emphasis"><em>File type</em></span> in the Save window, and select the appropriate Microsoft Office format from the list of available file formats that appears below—choose <span class="strong"><strong>Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP</strong></span> for a Writer document, for example.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="OpenOffice.org Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="openoffice.org_features"/>OpenOffice.org Features</h2></div></div></div><p>The three main applications in OpenOffice.org (Writer, Calc, and Impress) are quite similar to their pre–Office 2007 equivalents in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), so switching to the OpenOffice.org applications should be relatively easy if you were weaned on those versions of Microsoft Office.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1145" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1146" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1147" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1148" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1149" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1150" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1151" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you don't have any experience with Microsoft Office, you should still find it straightforward, because the basic layout is pretty intuitive. And if you are lacking in the intuition department, the built-in Help files are pretty good, too. To further help you along, the Tips system works just like tool tips in the Windows and Mac worlds. (In case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, <span class="emphasis"><em>tool tips</em></span> are those little yellow boxes that pop up to tell you what a button or menu item does when you place your mouse over that button or menu item.) Another cool and useful help feature is What's This, which is a more detailed version of the Tips system. If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>What's This</strong></span>, your cursor will turn into a little question mark. Move that question mark cursor over almost any item in the OpenOffice.org interface, and you'll find out what it does rather than just what the item is called.</p><p>Despite all the straightforwardness I am speaking of, a few interface items will most likely be unfamiliar to you. That being the case, I will briefly discuss those items. I'll be using the word processor, Writer, as I describe these things, so if you want to run OpenOffice.org while following along, Writer might be a convenient starting point for you too.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting to Know the Buttons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_to_know_the_buttons"/>Getting to Know the Buttons</h2></div></div></div><p>Although you should be able to figure out what most of the buttons on the OpenOffice.org toolbars do, a few buttons are common to all OpenOffice.org modules and deserve a bit more explanation.</p><div class="sect3" title="Export to PDF"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="export_to_pdf"/>Export to PDF</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17685"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656479.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/></div></div><p>The Export to PDF button is situated to the left of the two printer buttons (Print and Page Preview).

Although a hyperlink on a web page is something we have all come to take for granted, the idea of hyperlinking between text documents sounds like a pretty radical concept. It is, in fact, a rather old one that has been around since before you or I even heard of the Internet.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1152" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Navigator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="navigator"/>Navigator</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17713"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656483.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/></div></div><p>The fourth to the last button in the top row (the one that looks like a starburst) is the Navigator button. Clicking this button (or just pressing the F5 key) opens the Navigator window (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_navigator_window" title="Figure 12-5. The Navigator window">Figure 12-5</a>), which is a pretty cool navigational feature that comes in handy when working with lengthy or otherwise complex documents.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1153" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Navigator allows you to easily bounce back and forth between pages in a document or even between elements therein, such as sections, links, and so on. Let's say you have a document with lots of illustrations in it (like this chapter), and you want to jump directly from graphic to graphic. In this case, you would double-click the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Graphics</em></span> in the main pane of the Navigator window and then click the jump buttons (the odd little buttons to the left of the page number selector) to begin jumping.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_navigator_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17733"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656485.png.jpg" alt="The Navigator window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-5. The Navigator window</p></div><p>If you are dealing with a document containing various heading levels, such as all of the chapters in this book, you can also use Navigator to switch among those levels. Say you've decided to add a new main heading at the last minute to a document you've been writing. You thus need to drop all of the headings you had before down a notch; the former main heading becoming a subheading, and so on. By double-clicking the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Headings</em></span>, the text of all the headings you have listed in the document appears. You can then select a heading in that list and click the Demote Level button (that's the one at the far right of the second row of buttons) to move it down a level.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Gallery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gallery"/>Gallery</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17747"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656487.png" alt="image with no caption"/></div></div><p>To the right of the Navigator button is the Gallery button. By clicking this button, the Gallery, a library of graphical elements for use in your documents or web pages, will appear in a separate pane at the top of your document window (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_gallery" title="Figure 12-6. The Gallery">Figure 12-6</a>). The elements within the Gallery range from various types of lines to buttons to colored three-dimensional doughnuts, and you can even add items of your own.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1155" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1156" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1157" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1154" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_gallery"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17777"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656489.png.jpg" alt="The Gallery"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-6. The Gallery</p></div><p>Inserting a graphic into your document is a simple enough task even when not using the Gallery. All you need to do is select <span class="strong"><strong>Insert</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Picture</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>From File</strong></span> and then locate the image file you want to insert. It can be handier to use the Gallery, however, when you intend to use certain graphics frequently. Once in the Gallery, your graphics are always only a click or two away and can be conveniently viewed in the Gallery browser window.</p><p>The collection of artwork that comes with OpenOffice.org is mostly geared toward building web pages, but other clip art is available elsewhere. For example, you can find a great collection online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openclipart.org/">http://www.openclipart.org/</a>. Everything there is in the public domain, so it is all free to use. Be sure to check out the "Game baddie" collection—it's one of my favorites.</p><p>Adding these (or any other) graphic files to the Gallery is relatively easy to do. First you have to create a new category (called a <span class="emphasis"><em>theme</em></span>) for each group of images you want to add. To create a Gallery theme of your own, just click the <span class="strong"><strong>New Theme</strong></span> button in the Gallery window. This will open the Properties of New Theme window, where you should give your theme a name. Once you've done that, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Files</strong></span> tab and then the <span class="strong"><strong>Find Files</strong></span> button, which will open the Select Path window. From there you can navigate to the folder in which you are storing your clip art, photos, or other graphics. Once you have found the folder, click the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button, after which a list of all the files in that folder will appear in the Properties of New Theme window.</p><p>From this window, you can easily add images to your new Gallery theme by clicking the name of each image you want to add (you might want to make sure that the box next to the word <span class="emphasis"><em>Preview</em></span> is checked to make things a bit easier) and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button. Once you have done that, a copy of the image will immediately appear in the Gallery browser in your theme, where it will remain for future use (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#viewing_clip_art_and_your_own_collection" title="Figure 12-7. Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery">Figure 12-7</a>). When you are done adding images to your new theme, click the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button, after which the Properties of New Theme window will close, revealing your new theme and its contents. To use one of the images in the Gallery, just right-click the image you want to insert into your document, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Insert</strong></span>, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Link</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.</p><p>If you're more of a convenience-oriented type, you will be happy to know that you can use the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install a significant portion of the clipart available from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openclipart.org/">http://www.openclipart.org/</a>. Just search for and install <span class="emphasis"><em>openclipart-openoffice.org</em></span>. After the somewhat lengthy download and installation process is complete, restart OpenOffice.org (if it is running), and click the Gallery button. Your new collection will all be there!</p><div class="figure"><a id="viewing_clip_art_and_your_own_collection"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17847"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656491.png.jpg" alt="Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-7. Viewing clip art and your own collections in the Gallery</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Styles and Formatting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="styles_and_formatting"/>Styles and Formatting</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17856"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656493.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption"/></div></div><p>The final stop on our tour through OpenOffice.org's unfamiliar buttons is the Styles and Formatting button, which is located at the far left side of the second row of buttons. This button acts as a toggle for the Styles and Formatting window (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html#the_styles_and_formatting_window" title="Figure 12-8. The Styles and Formatting window">Figure 12-8</a>), from which you can select and then apply styles to any of the various elements within your document. Oh, and if you just can't take your hands off the keyboard for a moment to fiddle with the mouse, you can also open the window by pressing the F11 key.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1158" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-12-1159" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_styles_and_formatting_window"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e17874"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656495.png.jpg" alt="The Styles and Formatting window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-8. The Styles and Formatting window</p></div><p>To give you an example of how convenient using styles can be, imagine that you are typing a bibliography page for some document you've prepared. You typed each entry as you might any paragraph, as in the following:</p><a id="I_programlisting12_d1e17881"/><pre class="programlisting">Smythe, W. (2004). Reconsidering the need for speech
 between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. The Journal
 of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes, 20 (2), 125-147.</pre><p>Like most paragraphs you type, the entry is formatted as a first-line indent, which is fine and dandy except that you want a hanging indent, which is the norm for bibliography entries. Rather than messing around with tabs or margins to get things the way you want, all you have to do is click your mouse anywhere within the paragraph and then double-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Hanging indent</strong></span> entry in the Styles and Formatting window. After that, as if by magic (though you know better), the transformation is made:<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1160" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting12_d1e17891"/><pre class="programlisting">Smythe, W.

 between non-human interlocutors beyond the age of seven. The Journal
 of the Society of Elves, Faeries, and Garden Gnomes, 20 (2), 125-147.</pre><p>You could follow the same procedure for each of your other entries or, with Hanging indent selected, click the <span class="strong"><strong>paint can</strong></span> button in the Styles and Formatting window, after which your mouse cursor, when placed over the document, will appear as a paint can. Click in any other paragraph in your bibliography, and that entry, too, will be formatted in the new style. The process is essentially the same when applying different styles to any other document elements.</p><p>One thing that might annoy you when using the Styles and Formatting window is that it can be a pain at times, floating around as it does. It has a tendency to get in the way of your text no matter where you put it. Sure, you can toggle it on and off, but if you're using it a number of times within the same document, this can be get old too.</p><p>A happy compromise is to dock the Styles and Formatting window into the main document window. You can do this by dragging the Styles and Formatting window to the top-left or top-right corner of the document work area.

It also has a couple of rather interesting features, such as its autoresize function, which magnifies the onscreen document size (fonts, images, and everything) or shrinks it as you increase or decrease the size of the program window. And in case you're wondering, AbiWord can save and read Microsoft Word DOC files and save documents as PDF files.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1163" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can easily install AbiWord via the Ubuntu Software Center by performing a search for <span class="emphasis"><em>abiword</em></span>.

GNOME's Sticky Notes is a panel applet that you can add to your own panel by right-clicking any open panel space and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Panel</strong></span> in the pop-up menu that appears. When the Add to Panel window appears, click <span class="strong"><strong>Sticky Notes</strong></span>, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button.

Like Sticky Notes, Tomboy also works as a panel applet, but it is a bit more full featured, albeit without making any claims to stickiness. Instead, the various notes you create can be viewed by selecting them from the menu that appears when you click the Tomboy panel applet. All in all, it's a very handy approach.<a id="IDX-CHP-12-1165" class="indexterm"/></p><p>What really gives Tomboy its bragging rights, however, is its search and hyperlink functions. These allow you to search for entries within your entire Tomboy note library and create hyperlinks that connect text in one note to another linked note. In fact, Tomboy will automatically create a hyperlink whenever you type a word that matches one of your existing note headings. To make matters even more exciting (or at least more useful), Tomboy, by means of its plug-ins feature, allows you to export notes to HTML or print them, either as hard copy or as PDF docs.</p><p>If you'd like to try Tomboy, start it by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Tomboy Notes</strong></span>, after which Tomboy will appear in the top GNOME panel.</p><div class="figure"><a id="notes_taken_seriouslymtomboy"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject12_d1e18029"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656505.png.jpg" alt="Notes taken seriously—Tomboy"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 12-13. Notes taken seriously—Tomboy</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="GnuCash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="gnucash"/>GnuCash</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are familiar with the personal financial management software Quicken, then you might be interested in GnuCash, which is the Linux world's best-known offering in the personal finance arena.
