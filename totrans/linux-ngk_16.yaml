    between these two is essentially the same as that between bitmap and vector graphics,
    which I discussed in [Chapter 14](DDU0102_split_000.html#622).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bitmap characters are stored as a map of dots — the bitmap. The main limitation
    of bitmaps is that they only look good at the size and resolution they were designed
    for. Just like bitmap images, the more you enlarge a bitmap character, the worse
    it looks. This is particulary noticeable in rounded characters, such as O and
    P, where “the jaggies” becomes an issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outline fonts, on the other hand, are similar in concept and design to vector
    graphics. Each character is stored as a mathematical formula, and just like vector
    graphics, outline characters keep their clean shape no matter how much you enlarge
    them. The main outline font formats are Type 1, or PostScript, which was developed
    by Adobe, and TrueType, which was developed by Apple. As free TrueType fonts are
    so easy to deal with, so readily available on the Net, and so easily handled in
    Fedora Core, I will focus on TrueType fonts in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your Fedora system comes with a wide variety of very usable and, at least to
    my eyes, rather handsome TrueType fonts. However, these tend to be a bit on the
    conservative side of the aesthetic spectrum, and many users tend to want to add
    a few somewhat more distinctive, usually wilder, fonts to the system repertoire.
    In my own case, I had this really cool idea of writing messages to my friend in
    old Scandinavian runes. Of course, my friend wet-blanketed the whole idea, so
    it all came to naught.

    but you may want to print out an award for some event using some sort of Gothic
    font, or you might be preparing a newsletter for your local chapter of the snail
    breeders’ society and want to use a font that is round, bubbly, and slimy. Whatever
    your penchant, purpose, or desire, you will probably come to the point when you
    want to install some other TrueType fonts on your system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you install anything, of course, you have to find some fonts. The Internet
    is a good source, of course, and there are many sites that have a variety of freeware,
    shareware, and for-sale TrueType fonts available for download. When choosing and
    downloading fonts, it is best to select those designed for Windows rather than
    those for Mac. Fonts designed for the Windows world will most likely be in the
    form of ZIP files, and this will pose no problem for you, because once they are
    on your machine you can extract them with File Roller. Simply double-click them,
    just as you have with the other tarballs you have used thus far, and go through
    the File Roller steps you learned in [Chapter 9](DDU0068_split_000.html#372).
    Once you’ve done this, the font file will appear as an icon showing an upper-
    and lowercase sample of the first letter in that font (see [Figure 16-1](#figure.DDU167)).

    you can also see all, or at least almost all, of the characters in a given font
    by double-clicking the font icon. A window, as shown in [Figure 16-2](#figure.DDU168),
    will open, showing you most of the characters in A-to-Z format and then in the
    traditional “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog” format that you may
    well remember from your junior or senior high school typing classes.

    means there are two ways to install fonts, depending on what applications you
    want to make the fonts available to. Rather than twist your mind by explaining
    the technical aspects of these differences, I will instead just tell you how to
    install fonts by each method and which applications each installation method will
    make the fonts available to. Fortunately, the easier of these two installation
    methods will probably be the only one in the future, but for now you’ll need to
    know about both.

    system. Such fonts will be available to GNOME and KDE applications, to Mozilla,
    and, with a tad more tinkering, to OpenOffice.org. These fonts are also available
    to your system for customizing GNOME and KDE. Basically, if you’re not trying
    to install fonts for use with the GIMP, this easy method is the method to use.

    install the fonts locally (for use only by the user who installs them) or globally
    (for use by all users on the computer). To keep things easy, I will begin with
    the local installation process, as that is by far the easiest of all.

- en: So what happens if you have a Linux-only setup, and consequently no Windows
    fonts, but you still have to deal with documents you receive that are written
    with Windows fonts? Well, fortunately you are in luck, because you can download
    and install the group of fonts known as Microsoft TrueType Core Fonts, which includes
    Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Comic Sans, and a few others. These fonts
    are actually packaged as Windows executable files (.exe), so you will also need
    to install a utility called **cabextract** in order to extract the fonts (the
    .ttf files) from the .exe files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The cabextract utility can be downloaded and installed with Synaptic. Just
    type cabextract in the **Find** search box, and then follow the usual procedures
    that you learned in [Chapter 10](DDU0076_split_000.html#452). To get the fonts,
    go to [http://sourceforge.net/](http://sourceforge.net/) projects/corefonts. On
    that page, scroll down until you get to the **Latest File Releases** section.
    There you should find three items: **cabextract**, **corefonts**, and **the fonts**.
    To proceed, click the **Download** link next to **the fonts**, which will take
    you to the download page, from which you can select the fonts you want. I would
    recommend installing at least Arial, Courier, and Times, because they are not
    only pretty standard fare out there in the computing world, but they also provide
    you with significant foreign language support, which could come in handy even
    if you don’t consciously care about such things.'

    the fonts in those .exe files. To make it easy, it is probably best to first create
    a new folder inside your Home folder, call the new folder mscorefonts, and then
    drag all the .exe files you downloaded into that folder. Once you’ve done that,
    open a new Command Terminal window and do the following (you don’t have to be
    root to do any of this):'

- en: If you look inside the mscorefonts folder, you should see the original .exe
    files, your new fonts (the .ttf files), and maybe even a file called **fontinst.inf**,
    which you can ignore. To install the fonts, just install the .ttf files by following
    the instructions earlier in this chapter for installing fonts using the easy method.

    by giving you the means to create your own fonts (or at least modify someone else’s).
    PfaEdit allows you to create or modify TrueType, PostScript, and bitmap fonts
    (see [Figure 16-4](#figure.DDU170)). The interface itself seems a bit dated, but
    don’t let that fool you; PfaEdit is quite capable and easy to use.

    To do so just type pfaedit in Synaptic’s **Find** box and then follow the procedures
    you learned in [Chapter 10](DDU0076_split_000.html#452). As the package is an
    RPM file with no unmet dependencies, installation will go quite smoothly.

    or go to the Main menu, select **Run Application**, and then type the command
    pfaedit and click **Run**. Rather than do this every time, you will no doubt want
    to create a launcher on your own, so check out [Appendix A](DDU0148_split_000.html#902)
