    box,” as it were. You’ve got a web browser, an email client, a full office suite,
    a music player, solitaire. . . . What more could you want? Well, no matter how
    much is crammed into the default install, it’s always good to have options. And
    Ubuntu is all about options.

- en: Software installation works differently on Ubuntu than what you’re probably
    used to. On Windows, you might have to root around on a website to find an *.exe*
    file to download or go to a store and buy a CD with the software on it. You’d
    then run the installer and click through a seemingly endless procession of options
    and questions before it decides to start installing your new application. On Mac
    OS, you might have to do something similar, although perhaps with a little less
    hassle.

    for all of your software needs. No need to hunt around online for a download or
    wait for an install CD to arrive in the mail. No need to tell some snooty installer
    your shoe size and favorite color either. No, the Software Center does it all
    for you, with a minimum of fuss. In many ways, it’s like the “app store” on a
    smartphone, where you can get the latest and greatest apps with little more than
    a click.

    or *packages*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APT is a pretty foolproof way of installing programs; nothing will go missing,
    since APT automatically downloads and installs any files that the main application
    you are installing requires to run. Tracking down such files, called *dependencies*,
    used to be a significant headache for most Linux users. The painful quest of finding
    and then installing this file or that, as well as any dependencies that those
    files themselves might have, has led to the missing dependency problem being referred
    to as “dependency hell.” APT makes that pretty much a thing of the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, where does APT find all these files and applications? Well, the packages
    that APT searches for, downloads, and installs are located in a set of specific
    repositories. These *repositories* are online servers on which a great number
    of applications, support files, and more are stored for use with your system.
    All of the files that originally came bundled with your system, including the
    system (kernel) itself and updates, when available, are stored there too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The one thing about APT that some people, especially beginners, might consider
    a problem is that it is a command-driven application. This means you control it
    by typing commands in a command Terminal. That’s where the Software Center comes
    in—it’s a *frontend* to APT. Broadly, this means that the Software Center controls
    APT, running all of the commands needed to install software in the background,
    without you needing to worry about them. Neat, huh? In this chapter, you’ll be
    learning all about the Software Center, as well as a couple of other frontends
    that you might come across from time to time.

    that are installed by default in Ubuntu, ones that you’ll likely never use yourself.
    You see, the Software Center isn’t just a way of getting your hands on new, exciting

    so you can happily hide them away again by clicking the **Hide** button at the

    you need to be aware of a few things before you dive in. Many of these items are
    actually quite important for the day-to-day running of your system, and removing
    them might have some negative side effects. There’s a program that’s responsible
    for managing your Internet connection, for example; it’s probably best to leave
    that one alone. Also, many of the technical items are needed to make some of the
    more familiar applications work, like the web browser and email client. Because
    of the way APT handles these dependencies, removing the technical item will cause
    everything that depends on in to be removed too. Again, this is probably not what
    you want. In general, if it’s hidden away in the “technical items” list, you probably
    don’t want to uninstall it.

    Back in the early days, Linux distributions like Ubuntu would include only free

    just for the fun of it, without any hint of a desire to charge for them. For the
    most part, this is still how it works: The vast majority of the software developers
    writing programs for Linux have continued to share their apps openly. But more
    recently, a few distros have started to let in commercial software developers,
    people who charge for their products. Ubuntu is one of them. The idea is that
    most people are used to paying for software and aren’t so bothered about the open
    source aspect that they don’t like having more apps to choose from. The free apps

    not much more difficult to reach. Various individuals and companies compile small
    numbers of packages that are not available in Ubuntu into their own *third-party
    repositories*. These are typically free to access, if you can find them. All you
    need to do is tell APT to search for packages in one of these repositories as
    well as Ubuntu’s, and you’ll be able to get at the extra software.

    contains extra information about the repository, which APT uses to figure out
    what sort of packages it contains. You’ll need to get the correct APT line from
    the website of the repository you’re trying to add, so let’s pick an example to
    see how it works. Open Firefox and head over to [http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install](http://www.getdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install).
    GetDeb specializes in making packages for software that hasn’t officially made
    it into Ubuntu yet. There should be some instructions on installing packages from
    GetDeb in a box at the top of the page, so skip to the second item in the list
    and find the APT line, which should look something like this: `deb` [http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu](http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu)
    `precise-getdeb apps`. This follows the same format as all APT lines: the word
    `deb`, followed by a web address, followed by a couple of other words that specify
    which part of the repository should be checked by APT when it’s looking for programs.
    Highlight the APT line, right-click it, and select **Copy** from the pop-up menu.'

- en: While you’re in Firefox, you’ll also need to grab the repository’s *GPG key*
    (which I’ll explain more at the end of this section). It should be linked to from
    the same website you got the APT line from; in the case of GetDeb, go to [http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key](http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key);
    when the Opening getdeb-archive.key window appears, select **Save File** and click
    **OK** to save the key file.

    key, the Software Center will refuse to display any of the packages from the repository

    own software. There are all sorts of little programs out there that someone has
    written to scratch an itch of theirs, and plenty of them are available to you,
    for free, if you know where to get them. Luckily, most of them can now be found
    in *personal package archives (PPAs)* on Ubuntu’s project website, Launchpad.
    PPAs are miniature software repositories that are an easy way for people to share
    their home-brewed software with others (emphasis on the home-brewed—sometimes
    software from PPAs doesn’t work very well). Increasingly, PPAs are also being
    used by the developers of important software like Firefox to get their latest
    and greatest out to users. Whether it’s official updates or homebrew apps that
    you’re looking for, you can find software in PPAs by visiting [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas/)
    and searching for what you want.

    Some of these PPAs are provided in an unofficial and untested manner, so you have
    to watch out when using them—things might not work as expected. Increasingly,
    however, major software developers are starting to provide their own *official*
    PPAs from which you can obtain the very latest release of their programs. If a
