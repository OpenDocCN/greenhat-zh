Even if you’re not much of a surfer, numerous applications that aren’t really Internet applications per se still use the Internet in someway, such as by gathering song and album information when you rip audio CDs to create MP3 files. Having a computer that isn’t hooked up to the Internet is like buying a new Maserati and then refusing to take it out of the garage.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0001"/></p><p>Of course, how you connect to the Internet depends on your hardware and provider. There are a number of possibilities, including high-speed local area networks (LANs), cable modems, mobile (3G/4G) broadband, and ADSL connections from phone companies. Some computers still have an internal 56 Kbps modem or can be connected to external dial-up modems for slower connections over regular phone lines. Depending on what you have, setting things up on your system should prove a cinch in the case of LAN connections and any other types of connections that use your Ethernet port (such as cable modems), possibly a tad more work in the case of wireless and mobile connections, and sometimes a bit of a challenge when it comes to dial-up connections. In this chapter, you will learn how to set up these connections, and in the next chapter, you will learn a bit about what Linux has to offer in terms of the most commonly used Internet applications.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0005"/></p><div class="sect1" title="How Do You Connect?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_do_you_connect_question"/>How Do You Connect?</h1></div></div></div><p>The way you go about setting up your connection really depends on how you’re trying to connect to the Internet.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you connect your computer to a wall socket, a router, or a cable modem by using an Ethernet cable, go to <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wired_connection" title="Setting Up a Wired Connection">Setting Up a Wired Connection</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wired_connection" title="Setting Up a Wired Connection">Setting Up a Wired Connection</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you connect to a wireless network or your own wireless router, head to <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wireless_connection" title="Setting Up a Wireless Connection">Setting Up a Wireless Connection</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wireless_connection" title="Setting Up a Wireless Connection">Setting Up a Wireless Connection</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have an ADSL or DSL modem that is built in to your computer or connects to a USB port, try <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#connecting_with_a_dsl_or_adsl_modem" title="Connecting with a DSL or ADSL Modem">Connecting with a DSL or ADSL Modem</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#switching_off_or_refreshing_your_wireles" title="Switching Off or Refreshing Your Wireless Connection">Switching Off or Refreshing Your Wireless Connection</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you connect using a dial-up modem connected to your phone line, <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_dial-up_connection" title="Setting Up a Dial-up Connection">Setting Up a Dial-up Connection</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_dial-up_connection" title="Setting Up a Dial-up Connection">Setting Up a Dial-up Connection</a> is the one for you.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you connect using a mobile (3G/4G) broadband connection that plugs in to your computer, go to <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#mobile_broadband_connections" title="Mobile Broadband Connections">Mobile Broadband Connections</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#mobile_broadband_connections" title="Mobile Broadband Connections">Mobile Broadband Connections</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Whichever method applies to you, one thing is almost certain—you’ll be using an application called Network Manager to help set up and manage the network connection. The easiest way of getting to Network Manager is through the Network icon on the top panel (mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. A New Place to Call Home">Chapter 3</a>). It changes its appearance depending on what type of network you are connected to, but finding it isn’t hard. Look at the row of icons on the right-hand side of the top panel, and you should find the Network icon sandwiched somewhere between the Messaging menu (which has an envelope icon) on the left, and the Sound menu (which has a speaker icon) on the right. You’ll know you’ve got the correct icon if, when you click it, the item at the very bottom of the pop-up menu that appears says <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Connections</strong></span> (as in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#the_network_menu" title="Figure 4-1. The Network menu">Figure 4-1</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_network_menu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e2633"/><img alt="The Network menu" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263484.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-1. The Network menu</p></div><p>With that knowledge in hand, skip to the section that applies to your type of Internet connection and get connecting!</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Setting Up a Wired Connection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="setting_up_a_wired_connection"/>Setting Up a Wired Connection</h1></div></div></div><p>If you have a high-speed Internet connection from your cable television company or ISP or if you are connected to the Internet by a LAN at your office, you are really in luck, because these setups are probably the easiest to deal with. I’m going to assume that you’ve already set up your router or modem according to your Internet provider’s instructions so all that remains is to connect an Ethernet cable between the modem/router (or LAN wall socket) and your computer’s network socket.

If the site comes up, you know you’re all set.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0013"/></p><p>If you have a problem getting online and you are trying to connect via a LAN or cable modem, you could try to refresh your connection by clicking the Network icon on the top panel, unchecking the <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Networking</strong></span> item in the pop-up menu, waiting a few seconds, and then checking the <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Networking</strong></span> item in the pop-up menu again. If that doesn’t work, try restarting your machine while physically connected to your Internet source with the Ethernet cable.</p><p>If the problem persists, it could be that your network or service provider does not automatically assign addresses via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). <span class="emphasis"><em>DHCP</em></span> is a means by which your Internet provider can automatically provide your system with the configuration information it needs in order to connect to the Internet.

To get started, you need to have the right hardware. If you just want to go wireless, then all you need is a wireless network card (sometimes referred to as an <span class="emphasis"><em>802.11a/b/g/n card</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Wi-Fi card</em></span>). These are built in to almost all modern laptops, while for older models they are usually add-ons in the form of cards that pop into the PCMCIA slot on the side of your computer (as shown on the right of <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wi-fi_setupman_access" title="Figure 4-4. All you need for a Wi-Fi setup—an access point and a network interface card">Figure 4-4</a>).</p><p>Some wireless cards plug in to one of your machine’s USB ports or, in the case of desktop models, one of its internal PCI slots. Although support for cards of this type has improved in the past couple of years, there are still gaps, and some cards can be tricky to deal with. You’ll find some tips on how to deal with awkward cards in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Wounded Wings">Chapter 22</a>, but if you’re looking for a sure thing, cards listed as having a Ralink 2500/RT2400, Realtek RTL8180, or Atheros AR9170 “chipset” are definitely supported by Ubuntu.</p><div class="figure"><a id="all_you_need_for_a_wi-fi_setupman_access"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e2884"/><img alt="All you need for a Wi-Fi setup—an access point and a network interface card" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263490.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-4. All you need for a Wi-Fi setup—an access point and a network interface card</p></div><p>As for cards of the built-in or PC card variety, you will find support much better, but even then you have to make sure, or at least hope, that the card you are using is Linux compatible. No matter what wireless card you are wondering about, the easiest way to find out whether it will work is just to try it. The Linux kernel now comes with many wireless drivers built in, and Ubuntu updates often provide new ones, so if you use a card that is compatible with one of those drivers, things will be smooth sailing. If things don’t seem to work, check Ubuntu’s list of supported cards (<a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported/</a>) or check the Ubuntu forums to find a driver that is compatible or to see whether anyone has experience with your particular card. If you want to set up a wireless system in your home or office, then you will also need to get a <span class="emphasis"><em>wireless access point</em></span> (WAP), shown on the left of <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#all_you_need_for_a_wi-fi_setupman_access" title="Figure 4-4. All you need for a Wi-Fi setup—an access point and a network interface card">Figure 4-4</a>. Fortunately, Linux compatibility is not much of an issue in this department, because the access point doesn’t physically interface with your computer and the settings are handled via your web browser.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0031"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0034"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Access points come in several types. The most common type is a wireless router, which many ISPs provide for free.</p></div><p>You should be aware, however, that a small minority of access points require you to use Internet Explorer to handle their setup chores. Although it is possible to get Internet Explorer up and running in Linux via Wine (which you’ll learn more about in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Penguins at the Gates">Chapter 19</a>), you can’t be 100 percent sure that it will work. Unless you have a Windows machine somewhere in your house or office to handle such chores, it is probably a good idea to steer clear of access points of this kind.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0035"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Activating Your Wireless Card"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="activating_your_wireless_card"/>Activating Your Wireless Card</h2></div></div></div><p>Setting up a Linux-compatible wireless card is relatively simple. First connect your access point to your Internet source and then turn on the access point. Once it is up and running, plug your wireless card in to the PCMCIA slot or USB port on your laptop (unless your wireless connection is built in, in which case you can forgo this step). Any LEDs on the external card will most likely light up at this time.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0036"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0039"/></p><p>If your access point was on when you booted up your computer and your wireless card was in place during bootup, you probably don’t need to do much else to access the Internet. Just follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Click the Network icon on the top bar to reveal a drop-down menu showing the wireless signals that are present in your vicinity and the strength of each signal (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#the_network_menu_shows_you_available_wir" title="Figure 4-5. The Network menu shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths.">Figure 4-5</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_network_menu_shows_you_available_wir"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e2974"/><img alt="The Network menu shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths." src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263492.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-5. The Network menu shows you available wireless networks and their signal strengths.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>From that menu, select the signal for your access point (or any other wave you are entitled to latch onto) by clicking it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Network icon will start to pulse, showing that your system is trying to connect to the Internet.

If you didn’t choose your own password when you set up the access point, try looking for a sticker on the base or side of the access point to see whether a default password is used. If you’re trying to connect to a network for which you don’t happen to know the key, then chances are you are not supposed to be making the connection in the first place. Naughty, naughty.</p></div><p>If you were not successful in making your wireless connection (the system will tell you whether that’s the case), you have a few possibilities beyond the annoying incompatible card scenario. First, double-check to make sure your card is physically turned on. I know that sounds dumb, but I have been guilty of this oversight myself on numerous occasions. Many laptops have a key you can press to enable or disable the wireless card; on mine, you have to press the function key (<span class="keycap">fn</span>) and F2 at the same time (there’s a little wireless antenna icon on the F2 key to denote this).</p><p>Another possibility is that you are not entering the correct WEP or WPA password. The first thing to check is case sensitivity: It sometimes matters whether the letters you type are upper- or lowercase, so make sure you type them exactly as written. Additionally, some wireless access points require you to type the “wireless key” rather than a passphrase or password. A wireless key normally consists of a seemingly random string of numbers and letters that is 10, 26, or even 58 characters long and looks something like this: <code class="literal">af564ecb31ce4a678b23fe5981</code>. Try typing your own wireless key (not the one that I just used as an example!) instead of the passphrase and see if that works. If you don’t have the wireless key written down anywhere, look through the access point’s manual to see how to find it.</p><p>If you are trying to connect to a wireless network in a public place (for example, at a conference center, university, or airport or on a train), you may need to perform some additional steps to finish setting up the connection. These might include visiting a specific website in your web browser to register for the service or providing your <span class="emphasis"><em>MAC address</em></span> to the network administrator. For the first of these, open Firefox and type the address that the provider of the wireless connection should have given you. Hopefully, a page will load, and you’ll be asked to enter some details. If you’re asked for your MAC address, you should instead click the Network icon and select <span class="emphasis"><em>Connection information</em></span> from the menu that appears. Then find the Hardware Address (which will look similar to the one in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#connection_information_comma_including_t" title="Figure 4-6. Connection information, including the MAC address">Figure 4-6</a>) and copy it down and give it to whoever needs it.

If you still have no luck, try turning the wireless card off and on again using a switch or button, if you have one, or unplug it and plug it back in again.

If it can be connected using an Ethernet cable, use that and follow the instructions in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wired_connection" title="Setting Up a Wired Connection">Setting Up a Wired Connection</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#setting_up_a_wired_connection" title="Setting Up a Wired Connection">Setting Up a Wired Connection</a>; it’ll be much easier than trying to use a USB cable! If you have a USB or internal modem, try the instructions in this section and hope for the best.</p><p>The first step is to check whether Ubuntu recognized your modem. Assuming the modem is already plugged in, click the Network icon on the top bar, select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Connections</strong></span> from the menu that appears, and select the DSL tab. If a connection is listed in that window, your modem was recognized, and you can begin setting it up. If the list is empty, refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/</a> to see whether there are any steps you can follow to get your modem working. Alternatively, flip to <a class="xref" href="ch21.html" title="Chapter 21. A Colony of Penguins">Chapter 21</a> to see how you can ask for help with setting up your modem from members of the Ubuntu community.</p><p>Select the connection by clicking it once and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span>. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>DSL</strong></span> tab of the Editing window that appears and enter your username and password into the appropriate fields. Then enter your connection information (usually a phone number) into the Service box and click <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. Now click the Network icon on the top panel and choose your <span class="strong"><strong>DSL</strong></span> connection from the list. Network Manager will try to connect using your modem—if it’s not successful, go back and try changing some of the settings to see whether you can get it to cooperate.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0050"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0051"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0053"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0054"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="Setting Up a Dial-up Connection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="setting_up_a_dial-up_connection"/>Setting Up a Dial-up Connection</h1></div></div></div><p>Although much of the world is moving to high-speed Internet connections, you may still be using a dial-up Internet connection, which means you need to have a traditional dial-up modem to reach beyond your box to the outside world. In case you broadband surf-gods have forgotten, modems are those wonderful machines that whistle, chime, screech, and spit whenever you dial up your Internet provider. I suppose you could think of them as noisy telephones in need of a good burp.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0056"/></p><p>Now here comes the bad news—in the world of Linux, very few internal modems are supported, and for those that are, the setup process can be frustrating. The main reason behind this compatibility problem is that most built-in modems are software dependent and the software they depend on is part of, or designed for, Windows. Such modems are thus called <span class="emphasis"><em>Winmodems</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0057"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0058"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0059"/></p><p>Of course, the Linux community has been working on ways to deal with these Winmodem beasts so that they will work with Linux systems. Though support for the wide variety of Winmodem models out there is still spotty, things are better than before, so you might luck out. My advice is to hold off on the wondering and worrying and just give your modem a try to see whether it works. If it does, then you’re all set. If it doesn’t, well, you do have some options, and at least you haven’t done any damage to your system.</p><p>With all that intro-babble out of the way, let’s get down to the steps for setting up your dial-up connection. First, get the settings information you need from your Internet provider. Most providers aim their operations at Windows and, often, Mac users, and very few offer Linux support. Still, there is no technical reason for your Linux system not to work via their setups, so just nag and push them until they give you the information you want. After that, make sure your modem is connected to a live telephone connection—for example, the phone jack in your wall.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0060"/></p><p>Now it’s time to set up the connection. I’ll use the GNOME PPP program to do all of the setting up here, but there’s a caveat: It’s not installed by default, and you need an Internet connection to install it! If you have access to some other Internet connection that you can use temporarily, connect to that and use the Ubuntu Software Center to download and install GNOME PPP (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Rounding Out the Bird">Chapter 6</a> to learn how to install software). The alternative is to use the pppconfig command, which is installed by default but is difficult to use. Find another computer and check out <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/SetUpDialer/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/SetUpDialer/</a> for instructions if you have no alternative but to use <code class="literal">pppconfig</code>.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0061"/></p><p>Assuming that you got GNOME PPP installed using a borrowed Internet connection, you can follow these steps to set up your modem:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0062"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0063"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0064"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0065"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0066"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open the Dash, search for GNOME PPP, and click to open it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> and make sure you’re looking at the <span class="strong"><strong>Modem</strong></span> tab.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Detect</strong></span> button to identify your modem.

What happens, however, if your modem and Ubuntu do not see eye to eye? Well, there are a few options. My first, more radical suggestion is to dump your dial-up ISP and find a broadband provider that covers your local area. If that is not an option, then you have two ways to go. One is to try to geek around with your modem to see whether you can get it to work. This is a slightly complicated process, but there are instructions at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto/</a>. If you are faint of heart or a novice user, you may find the process to entail a bit more than what you’re willing to deal with.</p><p>The simpler, although costlier, way to get your modem to work is to purchase a true hardware modem. <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware modems</em></span> are not software dependent, so they work with any operating system. You can think of them as telephones without a handset.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0067"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0068"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0069"/></p><p>Such modems come in two forms: internal and external. As for the internals, the USRobotics models 56K V.92 Performance Pro Modem (internal slot) and 56 PC Card Modem (PC card slot, for laptops) are true hardware modems that are easily available and are said to work. You can check out the USRobotics site (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.usr.com/">http://www.usr.com/</a>) for more information on these models, though checking the Ubuntu forums for suggestions is always a good idea as well. Perhaps the safest of all solutions is to buy an external dial-up modem. They come with either serial or USB connectors and sit in a box outside your computer. They bring the advantage of not requiring you to open up the computer to install them.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0070"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0071"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0072"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0073"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0074"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0075"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0076"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0077"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0078"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0079"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0080"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-4-0081"/></p><p>Linux support for USB modems can be patchy, so do your research before buying one. Serial modems are a safer bet since most of them should work with your system . . . if you have a serial port, that is. Modern computers rarely have them anymore, so check to see whether you have one by looking at the back of your computer for a connector with little prongs in it (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#serial_port_and_connector" title="Figure 4-7. Serial port and connector">Figure 4-7</a>). If you are worried and are looking for a sure thing, USRobotics makes an external serial modem that is compatible with Linux, and the company says so right on its website.</p><p>If you find another model that you think will do the trick, before you commit to it by slapping down the cash, do a Yahoo! or Google search on that modem’s make and model number, along with the word <span class="emphasis"><em>linux</em></span>, and see what results you get. Of course, you can also try one of the Linux forums and ask about the modem make and model there. A lot of people are in the same boat, so you are sure to get plenty of opinions and advice.</p><div class="figure"><a id="serial_port_and_connector"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject4_d1e3409"/><img alt="Serial port and connector" src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1263496.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 4-7. Serial port and connector</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Mobile Broadband Connections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="mobile_broadband_connections"/>Mobile Broadband Connections</h1></div></div></div><p>Wireless networks, for all the convenience and freedom that they offer, have quite a limited range.
