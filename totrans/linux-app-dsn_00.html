<p class="nb">Toasters, ovens, and dishwashers are a few of the appliances found in our everyday lives. Though we are quite familiar with their use, few of us stop to think about how an appliance works under the hood, or even what makes an appliance, well, an appliance. This book defines an <i>appliance</i> as a device designed to primarily perform a single function. If you think about the appliances just mentioned, you’ll see that this definition holds true—toasters toast, ovens bake, and dishwashers wash dishes. Compared to a PC, which is capable of performing thousands of diverse functions depending on the hardware and software installed, traditional appliances are boring and simple.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What does this have to do with Linux? For starters, traditional appliances are no longer so simple. What used to be electrified but still mechanical devices, such as a vacuum cleaners, are now not only electronic, but include processors, circuit boards, and sophisticated user interfaces. With these changes comes the need to run an operating system on the appliance to manage the new features. Linux is a natural fit for this because it is low cost (in most cases, it is free to use) and open source (which means you can modify it to better suit your needs). However, the real place where Linux fits in is with the new types of appliances that are being designed. Digital video recorders (DVRs) were unheard of just a few years ago, but the first and most popular DVR appliance, the TiVo, runs on Linux, as do many other home networking and entertainment appliances.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="pagexviii"/>If you were to build the next great robotic house-cleaning system, you’d want to avoid designing it completely from scratch. You’d reuse as many parts as possible from your earlier robots, and you’d use off-the-shelf components wherever possible. The same <i>reuse</i> mentality applies to Linux appliances, and that’s where this book can help.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="intro.1"/><a href="toc.html#intro.1"><b>What This Book Is About</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book shows you how to build a Linux appliance, and it includes a prototype appliance that you can use as the basis for your appliance, if you wish. We divide an appliance into daemons and user interfaces and show how to create and manage daemons, as well as how to build five different types of user interfaces.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Appliance architectures</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• How to talk to running daemons</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• How to build and secure a daemon</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Laddie, our sample appliance</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Logging and event handling</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Web-based user interfaces</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Command line interfaces (CLIs)</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Front panel interfaces</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• Framebuffer interfaces, including infrared remote control</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• SNMP interfaces including tools, MIBs, and agents</p>&#13;
<p class="indent1">Most of the chapters have the same basic layout. We define and explain why the feature is necessary, we describe the feature’s challenges and common approaches, and we describe how we implemented the feature in our sample appliance.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="intro.2"/><a href="toc.html#intro.2"><b>What This Book Is Not About</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="pagexix"/>This book does not cover C programming, the Linux operating system, or the main application that defines a particular Linux appliance. Furthermore, this book is not about embedded Linux. We believe you will find the following books on embedded Linux useful:</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• <i>Embedded Linux</i>, by John Lombardo (SAMS/New Riders, 2001)</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• <i>Embedded Linux: Hardware, Software, and Interfacing</i>, by Craig Hollabaugh (Addison-Wesley, 2002)</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• <i>Linux for Embedded and Real-Time Applications, Second Edition</i>, by Doug Abbott (Newnes, 2006)</p>&#13;
<p class="bul">• <i>Embedded Linux System Design and Development</i>, by P. Raghavan, Amol Lad, and Sriram Neelakandan (Auerbach Publications, 2005)</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="intro.3"/><a href="toc.html#intro.3"><b>Who Should Read This Book</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is for Linux programmers who want to build a custom Linux appliance and support multiple user interfaces, build secure daemons, or provide logging and event management. The book may also be of value to any developer who wants to minimize the effort needed to port a daemon’s user interface to different operating systems or a different programming language. Our only major assumption is that the reader is comfortable programming in C on the Linux platform.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="intro.4"/><a href="toc.html#intro.4"><b>Why Use Linux?</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before diving into the common architecture found on most Linux appliances, we should answer the question, “Why use Linux on an appliance?” While the specific arguments vary, we’ve found the following to be true for appliances that we’ve built.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.5"/><a href="toc.html#intro.5"><b><i>Availability of Source Code</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The availability of source code makes it possible to customize the operating system for a particular appliance’s needs. Such customization is not possible when using a proprietary, closed source operating system.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.6"/><a href="toc.html#intro.6"><b><i>Range of Hardware Supported</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Linux kernel supports a wide range of processors, from low-end embedded processors used in consumer electronics to high-end 64-bit processors used in super-computers. For example, Linux runs on Marvell’s ARM-based XScale processors (used in Palm handheld computers), Texas Instruments’ ARM-based OMAP processors (used in E28 smart phones), IBM’s PowerPC (used in the TiVo and the PlayStation 3), Hitachi’s H8/300 processors, as well Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC, IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, and AMD <i>x</i>86-64 processors.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.7"/><a href="toc.html#intro.7"><b><i>Availability of Linux Developers</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Linux, C, and C++ form the core competence of many computer science graduates in the United States, and indeed, worldwide. Exact estimates vary, but the consensus is that that there are several million Linux-capable developers worldwide.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.8"/><a href="toc.html#intro.8"><b><i>Reliability</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="pagexx"/>Linux is sufficiently reliable to be widely used in data centers. Uptimes measured in years are not uncommon for Linux, and the Blue Screen of Death has never been a problem.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.9"/><a href="toc.html#intro.9"><b><i>Quality Compilers</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The GNU Compiler Collection is a comprehensive set of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and debuggers that support multiple languages on multiple platforms. It is the compiler of choice for C and C++ development on Linux. Furthermore, it is free. See http://gcc.gnu.org for more information.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.10"/><a href="toc.html#intro.10"><b><i>Good Documentation</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A great deal of documentation about Linux is available on the Internet. One site that serves as a good starting point for documentation is the Linux Documentation Project (see http://en.tldp.org). This site includes subject-specific HOWTOs, FAQs, and in-depth guides.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.11"/><a href="toc.html#intro.11"><b><i>Existing Software Packages</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are thousands of software packages available to help you develop an appliance on Linux. For example, there is Net-SNMP for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support, lm_sensors for monitoring the appliance’s hardware environment, and lighttpd for web support.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.12"/><a href="toc.html#intro.12"><b><i>Low Development Cost</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Linux appliance programmers can typically use their desktop machines for most software development because appliance user interfaces and services seldom need to be developed on the target hardware. Therefore, software development can proceed in parallel, with one team developing embedded Linux for the appliance and another team developing the main application and user interfaces.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.13"/><a href="toc.html#intro.13"><b><i>No Licensing Fees for Deployment</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Appliance manufacturers can generally build Linux-based appliances without incurring costs for licensing fees to distribute the appliance’s software, although there are some exceptions. For example, the Qt library from Trolltech and the MySQL database have licenses that may require payment for commercial use.</p>&#13;
<p class="secs"><a id="intro.14"/><a href="toc.html#intro.14"><b><i>Security</i></b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="pagexxi"/>Linux appliance developers use packages such as grsecurity and systrace to tighten security to levels undreamed of by Windows developers. Appliances have the additional advantage that a multi-purpose desktop or server can never be as secure as a well-hardened, single-purpose device.</p>&#13;
<p class="secl"><a id="intro.15"/><a href="toc.html#intro.15"><b>Linux Appliance Design</b></a></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We’ve tried to write this book and the accompanying CD to be used as a type of “parts box” that you can pull from as you assemble your appliance. A nice overview of the components in our parts box is given in the first chapter, which presents a high-level view of the architecture common to most Linux appliances.<a id="pagexxii"/></p>&#13;
