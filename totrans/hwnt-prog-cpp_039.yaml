- en: A company I worked with had a communications line that would fail every day
    at exactly 5:00 p.m. Every morning it would automatically start up around 7:00
    a.m. Extensive checks of both the hardware revealed nothing. Finally, an engineer
    was assigned to stay after hours and watch the communications line. That night
    the problem went away.

    stayed late and the problem went away. After several cycles of this it was determined
    that the communications line would crash at 5:00 p.m. unless an engineer was watching
    it.

- en: Finally one night an engineer decided to make a final check of the communications
    modem before leaving for the day. It was working. He turned out the lights and
    happened to glance back at the modem. It was dead. Turned on the lights, it came
    back on. Flipping the light switch on and off he found out that the modem was
    plugged into a switch wall socket.

    killing the modem. When they came in the next day, they turned on the lights.
    The engineer couldn't find the problem when he pulled his all-nighters because
    he left the lights on so he could watch the equipment.

    disappeared.
