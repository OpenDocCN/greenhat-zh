<a name="86" class="calibre15" id="86"/><a name="wbp05Chapter3P6" class="calibre15" id="wbp05Chapter3P6"/>Welcome to the GNOME Desktop</h2>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As I mentioned earlier, your Fedora distribution comes with two graphical  desktop environments: GNOME and KDE. Both have their own strengths and  weaknesses, and, as such, both have their fans and detractors. However, as  GNOME is the default environment in Fedora Core, and because I think it is  much easier for new Linux users to deal with, we will focus on it almost  exclusively in this book. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In case you’re wondering whether or not you’re missing out on anything  by using GNOME, let me assure you that you are not. You can run any KDE  application from within GNOME, and vice versa. In fact, once you have a look at  the Main menu, you will see that there are many KDE applications (<i class="calibre11">apps,</i> for  short) listed in the various submenus. Most apps beginning with a <i class="calibre11">K</i> are KDE  apps, such as the KAtomic and KBounce games, and the KPPP Internet dialer,  which I will discuss in Chapter If you followed my directions in <a href="DDU0018_split_000.html#42" target="_parent">Chapter 2</a>, KDE is also installed on your machine, and you are free to use it on your own once  you’re finished with this book. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GNOME desktop is shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU14">Figure 3-2</a>, and as you can see, it isn’t all  that different from what you might be used to in a Windows environment. But  don’t be completely fooled; despite the similarities, things are different enough  to be interesting. There are three main elements that you will probably notice  right off the bat: the desktop icons, the GNOME Panel at the bottom of the  screen, and the Main menu button at the far left corner of the GNOME Panel. I will focus on these elements in this chapter.<a name="87" id="87"/><a name="IDX-32" id="IDX-32"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see, there are three icons on the desktop: <i class="calibre11">user’s Home, Start Here,</i> and  <i class="calibre11">Trash</i>. To makes things simple, we’ll start with the easiest and, no doubt, most  familiar of these: Trash.</p>
<div class="calibre10">
<h3 class="sect3-title">
<a name="90" class="calibre15" id="90"/><a name="wbp05Chapter3P13" class="calibre15" id="wbp05Chapter3P13"/><i class="emphasis">Trash</i>
</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There is nothing mysterious about Trash . . . at least nothing mysterious about  the desktop Trash icon. It functions just as it does in other operating systems.  Drag a file you no longer need or want to the Trash icon, and the can will fill up.  If you want to empty the Trash, just right-click the Trash icon and, from the popup menu, select <b class="calibre13">Empty Trash</b>. If you drag something into the Trash that you are  not supposed to, you will be informed that you can’t do that. All very simple and  familiar, no matter from whence you came.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite the name of this icon, you needn’t start with it. In fact, you can  completely ignore it, as it is merely a collection of system preference links that  can be more easily selected from the Main menu, but more on that later.<a name="92" id="92"/><a name="IDX-33" id="IDX-33"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The user’s Home icon on your own desktop will not say “user’s.” It will instead be  labeled with whatever your username happens to be. For example, my username  is “rg,” so my desktop icon says “rg’s Home.” If you are logged in as malachi, it  will say “malachi’s Home,” and so on. All quite logical. Of course, I can’t possibly  guess the username of every person reading this book, so I will stick to the more  generic “user’s Home,” or just “Home,” when referring to this icon, and, as you  will soon find out, I will do so very often.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you will notice, the Home icon is the image of a house (home) on a  folder. This should tell you that it is your home folder — something like the My  Documents folder in a Windows system. This is where all your files will be saved  to, all your downloads will be downloaded to, and all your music will be ripped  to. It is your territory and, even if you are on a multi-user machine, nobody  except you (assuming you are the only one who knows the root password) will  be able to nose around in there.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you double-click your user’s Home icon, a window will open up showing you  the contents of the folder — it serves as a shortcut to your user’s folder on the  hard disk. The program that creates this file-viewing and file-organizing system is  called Nautilus. You may not have thought of an operating system’s file manager  as a program before, but, in fact, that is what it is. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Nautilus has a lot of interesting features that deserve mention. For example, Nautilus has a very cool feature that no doubt was inspired by Mac OS 9’s  WindowShade feature: Double-clicking the title bar of any Nautilus window  causes the window to roll up, so to speak, into the title bar — a useful feature  when trying to get one window out of the way for a moment or two. There are  many more such features, so I will point out a few now, and more will appear in  later chapters.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the very handy things about Nautilus is that it acts as a sort of picture  viewer and previewer. When you view the contents of a folder that contains  graphics files, Nautilus displays thumbnails of the files (as shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU15">Figure 3-3</a>) along with the filenames. This lets you see your graphics files without having to  use any other special imaging software. Admittedly, this feature is no longer  unique in the world of operating systems, but it is handy nonetheless.<a name="96" id="96"/><a name="IDX-34" id="IDX-34"/>

</div>
<a name="98" id="98"/><a name="IDX-35" id="IDX-35"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">What is unique in Nautilus, however, is that when you double-click one of your  thumbnails, the image will open in the same window at a larger size, as shown in  <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU16">Figure 3-4</a>. In addition to that, you can zoom in to and out of the enlarged image  by manipulating the + and – magnifying glass buttons or by right-clicking that  general button area and selecting the desired percentage of zoom directly from  the pop-up menu. </p>

</div>
<a name="100" id="100"/><a name="IDX-36" id="IDX-36"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You cannot manipulate the image in any way while viewing it in Nautilus, but if  you want to make any changes to the image, all you have to do is right-click it and  then select <b class="calibre13">Open With </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> The Gimp</b> in the pop-up menu, which opens the file in  the GIMP — the Linux world’s answer to Photoshop (more about using the  GIMP later in this chapter and in <a href="DDU0102_split_000.html#622" target="_parent">Chapter 14</a>). With the GIMP, you can, among  other things, change the size of the image, adjust the color balance, brightness,  and contrast, convert the image from one format to another (from .jpg to .png,  for example), airbrush in a beauty mark on your cheek, and even stamp little  green peppers all over your head. All very cool indeed.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition to letting you view graphics files, Nautilus also allows you to read the  contents of text files (those saved with a .txt file format), again without the need  for any other software. If, for example, you have some notes that you jotted down  and saved as a text file, you can simply double-click the file’s icon in Nautilus,  and its contents will be displayed in the Nautilus window. Nautilus can even do  the same for PDF files, acting as a simple PDF previewer.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Nautilus also has a side-pane feature that opens up a variety of options. To see  the side pane, go to the <b class="calibre13">View</b> menu at the top of a Nautilus window and select  <b class="calibre13">Side Pane</b>. Your Nautilus window will now show a mostly empty pane on its left  side, with your username emblazoned upon it. In addition to your username, the  side pane also shows how many files and subfolders you have in the folder you  are currently viewing, and when you last added or deleted any files or subfolders  in that folder. If that isn’t enough to get your blood flowing, there’s more.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you click the <b class="calibre13">Information</b> menu within the side pane, you can see other  options. Perhaps the most useful of these, and one that a Windows user should  feel quite at home with, is the tree option. If you select <b class="calibre13">Tree</b> from the  <b class="calibre13">Information</b> menu, a folder tree of your entire hard-disk layout will appear  within the pane (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU17">Figure 3-5</a>). You can click on any folder in the tree, and its  contents will be displayed in the main portion of the Nautilus window. This is  very handy when you are busily searching for something within the various  subfolders you will eventually create.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Another very handy feature of Nautilus is that it lets you create bookmarks. You  are no doubt familiar with creating bookmarks for Web pages that you frequent,  but why on earth would you want to create bookmarks within your file system?  Well, imagine that you have a folder that you need to use often, but it takes an excessive number of mouse clicks to get to that folder, and all that clicking is giving you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Instead of maiming yourself in  that way, you could click your way to that folder once, and then, in the <b class="calibre13">Bookmarks</b> menu of the Nautilus window, select <b class="calibre13">Add Bookmark</b>. After that,  whenever you want to get back to that well-buried folder, you can just click the  Bookmarks menu, and that folder will be right there waiting for you in the drop- down list (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU18">Figure 3-6</a>). </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You will find, as you make your way along in the Linux world, that occasionally  you come across a file or folder that has a red, slashed circle symbol on it, as you  can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU19">Figure 3-7</a> on the next page. I refer to this as the <i class="calibre11">verboten</i> (meaning  <i class="calibre11">forbidden,</i> in German) symbol. This symbol can appear within an oval (meaning that you don’t have permission to read that file), or with a pencil in the middle of  it (meaning that you do not have permission to alter that file). This is another  way that Linux tries to protect you, though in the case of copied CD files, it may  not be clear as to how it’s doing so.<a name="107" id="107"/><a name="IDX-37" id="IDX-37"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you want to alter a file or gain access to a folder that has the <i class="calibre11">verboten</i> symbol, it  is possible to do so in the Nautilus window, provided that you are listed as the  owner of that file or folder. To change file or folder permissions, just right-click the file or folder in question, and then select <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> from the pop-up menu. Once the Properties window opens, click the <b class="calibre13">Permissions</b> tab, and you will see  who the owner of the file or folder is and what you are allowed or not allowed to  do with it (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU20">Figure 3-8</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You might find this permissions business a bit confusing, but it is really quite  simple to understand. As you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU20">Figure 3-8</a>, permissions can be granted  or denied to the <i class="calibre11">owner</i> of the file or folder (you), to a specified <i class="calibre11">group</i>, or to <i class="calibre11">others </i>(everybody else). These permissions are:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Read</b> Permission to view the contents of a file or folder.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Write</b> Permission to alter the contents of a file or folder.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">
<b class="calibre13">Execute</b> Permission to run a program or script.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In general, you needn’t worry all that much about setting permissions for your  own files, as you are really the only one who has access to your user account. The  main exception to this is when you transfer files from CD to your hard disk. In  this case, the files will be write-protected, meaning that you cannot alter the files  until you change the permissions for them. You will also eventually find,  especially when you try to change system settings or install additional program  packages, that there are a good number of files and folders that are protected by  root permissions, but you will learn how to deal with that in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are dealing with a folder or file that you have transferred from CD and  that, thus, has the red <i class="calibre11">verboten</i> symbol with a pencil in it, you can change the  permissions to allow you to alter that file by clicking the checkbox in the <b class="calibre13">Owner  </b>row next to the word<b class="calibre13"> Write</b>. Once you are done, click the <b class="calibre13">Close</b> button, and  you’ll be on your way.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">At the very bottom left corner of your screen is an icon of a red hat. This is the  Main menu, which is your access point to the majority of the applications and  utilities included on your system. In a sense, the Main menu is very much like the  Start menu in a Windows system, although it is not exactly the same. When you  click the Main menu icon, all of the applications and utilities available to you are  exposed.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite the importance of this menu, there is really very little to explain  about it, although a complete explanation of each item in the menu wouldn’t fit  in this book. My personal feeling is that it is fun to just browse through the  various items in the menu in order to see what you have to work or play with. It’s sort of like digging down to the bottom of a Christmas stocking. I will also discuss  some of these menu items in other chapters of this book, so if you’re not the  treasure-hunting type, just hang in there.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you have seen, the Main menu is located in the panel at the bottom of the  screen. This panel is a separate application, or program, called the GNOME Panel (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU23">Figure 3-11</a>). In operation, it is sort of a cross between the Windows  taskbar and the Mac OS X dock; and like both of those panel-like applications, it  can be moved, hidden, resized, and customized to an even greater extent than  with either of those two.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The GNOME Panel is not a static thing. You can add launchers (program  shortcuts or aliases), utilities, and even amusements to make it do almost  anything you want it to, within limits, of course. In the various stages of this  project, you will customize your Panel to make things more convenient for you as  you make your way through the rest of this book. You are, of course, free to  change any of the customizations I ask you to make, but I’d suggest holding off  on that until you finish the rest of the book — if you change things now, my  instructions may not match what you see on your screen. Once you’ve finished  the book, you can do whatever you like.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Each of the following subprojects in this project is very simple. Most are only  two-step point-and-click procedures that you should be able to handle without  any difficulty. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One item not initially displayed in the GNOME Panel is the Show Desktop  button.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the really cool features of Linux is that it allows you to work with virtual  desktops. Instead of viewing just one desktop, as in most operating systems, you  can view and work in up to 100 discrete desktops, and you can switch between  them with the Workspace Switcher. As things are, your Workspace Switcher  should show four squares, each representing one desktop. This makes the icon a  bit wide, and it takes up a bit too much space on your Panel. Because you are  most likely new to the idea of virtual desktops, I think that two should be enough  to play with for now — at least until you find out a bit more about them later in  the chapter. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Here’s how to reduce the number of desktops shown on the Workspace  Switcher:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of the features that I quite like about the GNOME Panel is the drawer. The  drawer is a little pop-up panel that acts as the perfect location to place launchers  that you do not want to place in your GNOME Panel because of space considerations and that do not appear in the Main menu and therefore must be run by  command. Launchers of this sort are useful for quickly opening most of the  programs that you compile from source code and also for several KDE programs.  Of course, you can put anything you want there, including frequently used files. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Adding a drawer to your Panel is very easy:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The drawer you’ve just added is, of course, empty at this stage, so let’s put it to  good use by adding launchers for a couple of KDE games that do not appear in  the Main menu.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now we come to what might seem the most useless part of this project: adding a  fish, named Wanda, to your Panel. At first glance, Wanda does little more than  bat her tail around and spurt out a bubble or two. However, if you click on her, a  window will pop up telling you what Linux kernel you are running, what time it  is, how long you have been logged on, and how many users are currently using  your machine, which could be useful. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get a glimpse of Wanda in action, limited though that action may be,  follow these steps:</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, to round things out, let’s get back to the realm of the clearly useful and  add a <b class="calibre13">Force Quit </b>button to the Panel. The <b class="calibre13">Force Quit</b> button is a very handy  utility that lets you quickly and easily deal with non-responding windows. Yes, it  does happen on occasion: A window suddenly refuses to do anything. Regardless  of what you want it to do or what it is supposed to be doing, it just sits there as if it  is on strike (maybe it is). With just one click of the <b class="calibre13">Force Quit</b> button, your  cursor becomes a powerful surgical instrument that will kill the window you  click on. You needn’t worry, however, because you can immediately run such  apps again, though in some cases you will have to reboot first.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You definitely don’t want to be without this button, so here’s how to add it to  the Panel:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">

</li>
</ol>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You are now done with this rather simple project. You have more or less learned  the basics of Panel customization and, in the process, created a very useful Panel configuration. If you did everything the way I told you to, your Panel should now  look like the one in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU26">Figure 3-14</a>.</p>

As is,  the new panel will be a bit too fat to look like a Mac menu bar, but you can  reduce its size in the Panel Properties window (a size of 29 or 30 pixels should do  the trick). <a name="141" id="141"/><a name="IDX-47" id="IDX-47"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To further Mac-ify things, you can right-click the panel to add a Menu Bar in the left corner (select<b class="calibre13"> Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Add Menu Bar</b>), a Window Menu to the far  right corner (select <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Utility </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Window Menu</b>), a Clock (select <b class="calibre13">Add  to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Accessories </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Clock</b>), a pair of Eyes next to that (select <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Amusements </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Eyes</b>), and a Sticky Notes utility (select <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Accessories  </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Sticky Notes</b>) to the left of that. This will give you a sort of hybrid Mac OS 9/X  menu bar. With a few more touches here and there, Mac emigrants can quite  easily create a desktop environment that looks very much like that in Mac OS X  (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU28">Figure 3-16</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It is now time to discuss a rather unique and convenient feature of Linux: virtual  desktops. And the best way to understand what this virtual-desktop business is all  about is to just give it a try. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In your GNOME Panel, click on Wanda, your Home folder, and Mozilla. You  will then have three windows open in your present desktop, or workspace. Now  look at the Workspace Switcher icon on your panel. The top half of the icon  should be blue; this is your present workspace. Click the bottom half of the icon, the gray half, and all your open windows will suddenly disappear.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Actually, nothing has really disappeared — you are just viewing a new  desktop. All your other windows are still open and running in the previous  desktop. In this second desktop you can open something else: Go to the Main  menu and select <b class="calibre13">Games </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> AisleRiot</b>. The AisleRiot solitaire card game will  soon appear. <a name="144" id="144"/><a name="IDX-48" id="IDX-48"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You now have windows open in two different desktops, and you can switch  back and forth between them. To do so, just go to the Workplace Switcher in your Panel and click the top gray box, which will take you to your original  desktop. Once you’ve done that, the bottom box will become gray, and you can  then click that one to go back to your game desktop.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can imagine, this feature has some potential benefits for you, in addition to helping you avoid clutter. Just imagine that you are at work typing up  some long document in OpenOffice.org Writer. Eventually, you get a bit tired  and decide to goof off a bit by playing GNOME Mines for a while. To do this,  you switch to another desktop where you open and play the game. A bit later,  when you notice your boss making the rounds of the office, you simply switch  back to the first desktop so that you look busy when he walks by and says,  “Keeping yourself busy, Boaz?” </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Phew!</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">It wouldn’t be fair to end this chapter without telling you how to take part in  what seems to be the average Linux user’s greatest passion: screenshots. I don’t  know why Penguinistas are so obsessed with screenshots; perhaps it is the fact  that they can customize their system so much, or perhaps it’s just that screenshots  can be taken so easily from within Linux. Whatever the reason, chances are that  any personal Linux Web page you come across will have at least a few screenshots  of that user’s desktop. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that you’ve joined the waddling masses, you can join in the fun too, and  in the process, show your friends and colleagues images of cool apps you have  found, show your mother by email where such-and-such a menu selection is (as I have often done), or just show off the cool customizations you’ve done to your  system after you’ve completed <a href="DDU0040_split_000.html#213" target="_parent">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Taking screenshots from within GNOME is pretty easy, and there are a few ways  to go about it. To take a shot of your whole desktop, just press the PRTSCN (Print  Screen) or PRTSCN-SYSRQ keys on your keyboard. A Save Screenshot window (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU29">Figure 3-17</a> on the next page) will then open and, by default, will ask you to save your screenshot to your Home folder. If you want to save the  screenshot to another folder, simply choose a different folder before you click  the <b class="calibre13">Save</b> button.</p>

<span><span>Figure 3-17: </span> Saving a screenshot </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Instead of using the PRTSCN key on your keyboard, you can add a screenshot  button to your Panel that will do the same thing, though I don’t see much  advantage in doing that, unless you want the I’m-taking-a-picture feeling that a  button provides. Anyway, to add the button, just right-click any empty space on  the Panel and select <b class="calibre13">Add to Panel </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Button </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Screenshot</b>. Then, when you want to  take a screenshot, all you have to do is click the button.<i class="calibre11"> Kachunk!</i><a name="148" id="148"/><a name="IDX-49" id="IDX-49"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you only want to take a screenshot of a single window, rather than of the entire  screen, the process is almost as easy. First, make sure your mouse cursor is  hovering within the boundaries of the window that you want to take the shot of,  and then just hold down the ALT key with one finger and press the PRTSCN key  with another. The Save Screenshot window will open.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">These methods of taking screenshots are simple, fun, and easy, but they do have  one limitation: They do not let you take screenshots while you have a menu  open. If you want to take a screenshot of the desktop or any window with an open menu, you will need to use the GIMP. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fortunately, taking a screenshot with the GIMP is also a very, very simple  procedure. First, start up the GIMP by going to the Main menu and selecting  <b class="calibre13">Graphics </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> The GIMP</b>. Once the ol’ GIMPster is open, go to the <b class="calibre13">File</b> menu at the  top of the main GIMP window (that’s the one with all the tools in it), and select  <b class="calibre13">Acquire </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Screenshot</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Screen Shot window will open shortly (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU30">Figure 3-18</a>). Once it is open,  select <b class="calibre13">Whole Screen</b> and adjust the numbers in the <b class="calibre13">Seconds Delay</b> field at the bottom of the window in order to give yourself enough time to get to the menu  you want open by the time the screenshot is taken. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you’re ready, click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, rush to open whatever menu it is you want to  take a shot of, and voilà, it will be done. The screenshot will soon open right  there within the GIMP, and you can do with it as you will.</p>

<a name="153" id="153"/><a name="IDX-50" id="IDX-50"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Well, now that you know your desktop environment so well, you may feel like  calling it a day and shutting down your machine. To do so, just go to the Main  menu and select <b class="calibre13">Log Out</b>. A small window will appear with three choices to  choose from: <i class="calibre11">Log out</i> (default), <i class="calibre11">Shut down</i>, and <i class="calibre11">Restart the computer</i>. Select <b class="calibre13">Shut  down</b> and then click <b class="calibre13">OK, </b>and the shutdown process will begin. If, however,  nothing seems to happen after clicking <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, press CTRL + ALT + BACKSPACE in  unison, which will bring you to the login screen (<a href="DDU0024_split_001.html#85" target="_parent">Figure 3-1</a> on <a href="DDU0025.html#87" target="_parent">page 32</a>). Once  there, click <b class="calibre13">Shutdown</b> at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up a small  window asking you if you are sure you want to shut down. Just click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>, and  shutdown will commence.<a name="154" id="154"/><a name="IDX-51" id="IDX-51"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">During the shutdown process, your screen will go back to text mode and you  will see a string of white text and green Oks on a black screen as the system shuts  down its various components. When it is all done, the system will most likely  power down your computer as well, in which case you are done. On a few  machines, however, the system cannot power down your machine. You will know  if this is so in your case because the flow of text on the screen will stop at the  words <b class="calibre13">Power down</b>. If you see those words on the screen and nothing else  happens for 15 seconds or so, then just power down the machine manually by pressing the power button. It is completely safe to do so at that point.</p>
