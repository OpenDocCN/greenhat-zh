    spot problems and provide suggestions for improvement. Correcting and refining
    process diagrams often requires several rounds of changes. In the process, teams
    will form a consensus about the details of how the product and process actually
    work. In addition, the effort can lead to improvements in existing processes.

    do not waste energy on politics, pointing out others' mistakes, or guarding their
    backsides. These companies encourage direct communication—employees trust management

    people's mistakes and protecting their positions. Workers believe they need to
    double-check the veracity of all statements from management. In such companies,
    management perpetuates low-trust cultures by rewarding low-trust behavior, such
    as political maneuvering, public verbal complaints about others, rumors, power
    plays to force decisions on other teams, and backstabbing. Low-trust cultures
    tend to breed in companies at which people are worried about losing their jobs.
    Management is often authoritative and political. Senior managers spend their energy
    pulling other people down to pull themselves up. In the absence of focused positive
    effort by top management, short-term advantages exist for individuals who exhibit
    low-trust behaviors to advance their position.

    that management make a focused effort by discussing company values and core beliefs

    hire the right people, train them in company culture, and model the behaviors
    they expect.

    no reviews, offer annual reviews for everyone at the same time, or offer annual
    reviews based on anniversary hire dates. From the company perspective, the review
    is driven by human resources (HR) to support corporate needs—perhaps to ensure
    that a review is on file to avoid potential lawsuits, especially if the person
    is terminated, or to reward people for good work so that they will stay.

    HR or the manager collects information for the review from people working with
    the employee to be reviewed. People in other teams or co-workers can usually offer
    useful insight into the employee's performance. As part of the 360-degree review,
    you should also require a self-appraisal from the employee. Self-appraisals are
    great opportunities for employees to list their achievements for the year and
    judge their own performance. Often the self-appraisals will remind you of tasks
    the employee took on months ago that you had forgotten.

    areas of performance. To write an essay review, start by collecting information.
    Ask the employee to complete his or her own version of the review and deliver
    it in advance of your meeting. If the company requires an employee self-appraisal,
    read it first. If self-appraisals are not required, you can still ask for them.
    Write your essay review with descriptions of the employee's successes and areas
    needing improvement. Keep the language straightforward and the text relatively
    short. On completion, review each sentence to make sure that it fits in the overall
    picture you want to provide for the employee.

- en: Growing companies' development teams create the best products when they communicate
    successfully with other departments within the company. Good interdepartmental
    communication keeps the concerns of the customers and the organization aligned
    with the work being accomplished. The most effective approach for creating successful
    companies and products is for the entire product team (development, sales, marketing,
    QA, and operations) to be able to discuss goals, problems, and solutions and then
    document them together to create working descriptions and a shared understanding
    of what those descriptions mean.^([[2](#ftn.CHP-3-FNOTE-2)])

    Appropriate discussions help developers refine solutions before coding begins,

    and the customer need to collaborate to define the product efficiently and avoid
    significant backtracking later.

    to ask questions about the intent of the code, to create better tests, and to
    provide better coverage for the system, thus improving product quality. It also
    uplifts QA team morale, as they will be taking part in the development effort.
    In contrast, some companies limit QA access to engineering so that programmers
    can be more productive, but QA engineers feel impeded by this situation, finding
    it more difficult to do good work as the importance of their role is diminished.

    groups during testing will allow developers to understand individual defects logged

    with the conflicting needs of access and excess in communications with engineering
    requires that the manager define a strategy and get the teams to buy into that

    QA engineers could bundle questions to present in an afternoon meeting rather
    than interrupting developers throughout the day with new questions.

    cannot get work done because of interruptions from other departments. Engineers

    the development manager tells the rest of the company not to talk to engineers.

    problems—the manager no longer worries about other people asking engineers to
    work on tasks that were not assigned by him, for example. However, this approach
    leads to long-term failure, because engineers cannot collaborate with others,
    and it indicates a lack of trust in other managers to manage their teams. The
    lack of collaboration leads to long schedules, poor product definitions, and low

    her technical and product knowledge. This newly minted manager, however, does
    not instinctively understand her role as a manager, but instead sees herself as
    an engineer who must now endure more interruptions and more paperwork. This new
    manager might in fact prefer to continue writing code full time, despite the perceived
    benefits of a management position. Without training and direction, she won't embrace
    her less code-oriented role and will believe that her only management responsibility
    is to answer team questions. The team will almost certainly become disillusioned
    with this manager.

    as a reason not to manage the team. When faced with difficult and unfamiliar challenges,
    new managers often fall back on what they do well—software development.

    needs to focus her energy on management and not writing code. Her manager should

    training and coaching, she should perhaps be sent back into full-time programming
    or another technical leadership role.

    so the short-term need should not arise again for that technical problem.

    but you, as the development manager, must take charge of the *candidate selection*
    process to grow your development team and company successfully. A company's hiring
    process usually consists of defined steps for opening the position, identifying
    candidates, filling out forms and getting approvals, setting up interviews, checking
    candidates' credentials, and making and approving an offer. However, this process
    does not define the candidate *selection* process, in which you decide *who* you

    amount of effort in hiring the best candidates will yield considerable results.

    on only a few traits ignores the importance of other key traits, including the
    candidate''s success history, work habits, industry experience, people skills,
    and other general (versus specific) technical abilities. A narrow interview focus

    potential candidates from the resumes you have solicited, ideally through your
    network. Follow this with a phone screening of candidates, selecting the most
    promising applicants for office interviews. Next, you'll interview the candidates
    at your facility along with an interview team and convene a post-interview meeting
    to collect information. After these steps, you should be ready to make a hiring
    decision.

    to evaluate a candidate fully. However, interviews usually consume more than a
    day's worth of engineering time per candidate if preparations and reviews are
    considered. Typically, if you're interviewing more than five candidates at your
    facility, you did insufficient screening earlier. Conducting a preliminary phone
    screening (or even a face-to-face lunch screening) eliminates overbooking of full-day
    interviews.

    pass the minimum bar. One approach is to make a list of each category and add
    a plus, zero (neutral), or minus symbol next to each category based on the quality
    of the candidate's responses. In the end, invite candidates with the most positives
    and fewest negatives for a face-to-face interview. It's a simple but effective
    measurement, and you can use the negative points as follow-up topics during the
