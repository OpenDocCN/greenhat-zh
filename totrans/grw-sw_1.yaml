    The CEO indicated that we were forced to freeze hiring and we would have to spend
    money carefully until business picked up. A week later, all the company managers
    received Mercedes leased by the company. When asked at the next company meeting
    why this occurred, the CEO explained that senior executives had previously had
    a "car allowance" that the accountants said was not tax-deductible. So management
    leased the cars instead, and they happened to arrive right after the budget cuts.
    When asked why he did not cut this expense, his response was that this type of
    incentive was necessary to retain top management talent.

  zh: QA团队的联系对工程师也有好处。例如，QA可以对用户界面的设计提供有价值的反馈。在测试期间，两组之间的密切接触将使开发者能够理解在跟踪工具中记录的个别缺陷。缺陷的清晰度减少了修复缺陷时的错误，而改进的缺陷修复则提高了产品进度，如第17章[理解质量保证](ch17.html
    "Chapter 17. UNDERSTANDING QUALITY ASSURANCE")中所述。
- en: Consideration and scheduling usually improves collaborative efforts. Dealing
    with the conflicting needs of access and excess in communications with engineering
    requires that the manager define a strategy and get the teams to buy into that
    strategy. For example, to avoid excess interruptions with development engineers,
    QA engineers could bundle questions to present in an afternoon meeting rather
    than interrupting developers throughout the day with new questions.

  zh: 考虑和安排通常可以提高协作效率。在与工程师的沟通中处理访问和过剩的需求冲突需要管理者制定策略并让团队接受该策略。例如，为了避免与开发工程师的过度中断，QA工程师可以在下午的会议上捆绑问题提出，而不是整天用新问题打扰开发者。
- en: Some managers try to isolate development teams from the other groups in the
    company by putting the team into a "black box." This forces people outside the
    engineering box to "throw requests over the wall," while engineering shoves software
    back out through a slot in the floor (or maybe through a network cable).

- en: A development manager might build a black box around his team with the best
    of intentions. Usually, he adopts the policy because engineers complain that they
    cannot get work done because of interruptions from other departments. Engineers
    complain the loudest when they're behind schedule on a critical project. In response,
    the development manager tells the rest of the company not to talk to engineers.

- en: On the surface, isolating the development team appears to solve several management
    problems—the manager no longer worries about other people asking engineers to
    work on tasks that were not assigned by him, for example. However, this approach
    leads to long-term failure, because engineers cannot collaborate with others,
    and it indicates a lack of trust in other managers to manage their teams. The
    lack of collaboration leads to long schedules, poor product definitions, and low

    an engineer who must now endure more interruptions and more paperwork. This new

- en: If the development manager with a team of one or two developers is effective
    at management as well as developing code, she might also be able to do both jobs.
    This works best for experienced managers who understand how to balance their management

- en: In the end, a new development manager who likes to write code can spend personal
    time working on individual projects. Open source projects present great opportunities
