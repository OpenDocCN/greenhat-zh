No fuss, no bother (and no need for a book like this one). That's the way Windows ought to work; when Windows identifies a network adapter during startup, it should automatically place a Network icon on the desktop and configure all of the settings your computer needs to make a connection.</p><p>But nothing is ever that simple. Before you can start to move data across a wireless network, you will probably have to tell Windows exactly how and where to find the network and how to connect to the Internet through the wireless LAN. This chapter explains the general principles involved in making Windows work with a wireless LAN and the specific procedures you will need to configure the networking tools and features in different versions of Windows. This is tedious, nitpicky stuff, but it will eliminate a lot of grief when your network connection doesn't work properly.</p><p>In Windows XP and Windows Vista, all of this configuration activity is supposed to happen automatically if your network adapter contains firmware compatible with Microsoft's automatic configuration tool. Most of the latest Wi-Fi adapters come with drivers that work with the Windows XP tools, but you might have to download an updated version to use your adapter with Vista. If your computer does not automatically recognize an adapter, look <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0551"/>for device driver software on the manufacturer's website.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-13"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Unfortunately, device drivers for Windows Vista are not available for many older Wi-Fi adapters, especially the ones that only use the 802.11b standard.

As far as Windows is concerned, a wireless adapter is just one more type of network interface that exchanges data with applications and the operating system. Up through Windows 2000, the "wireless" stuff happens someplace else; in XP, there's a separate tab for wireless-specific settings, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#the_wireless_network_connection_window_i" title="Figure 6-1. The Wireless Network Connection window includes a Wireless Networks tab.">Figure 6-1</a>.

It's entirely possible to set these values without understanding what they mean, but it's always helpful to know something about how the network actually works.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0554"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0555"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0556"/></p><p>The installation manual for the wireless access point on your LAN router should tell you which <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0557"/>IP addresses or other settings to use when you're configuring your network.

Every computer on a network must have a different address.</p><p>The agencies that administer the Internet have established a complex numbering system with a unique address for every device connected to the Internet. Numeric IP addresses always appear as four groups of numbers between 0 and 255, so the total universe of IP addresses runs from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. These numbers are sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>octets</em></span> because they use eight binary digits (binary 11111111 equals decimal 255).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0559"/></p><p>A numeric IP address can identify a single computer, or it can be a gateway to a LAN (or a larger network) with two or more computers connected to it through a router. In some networks, all the computers (and other devices such as printers) on a LAN can share one public interface through a mechanism known as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0560"/>Network Address Translation (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0561"/>NAT).</p><p>Each local computer must also have a unique numeric IP address within the LAN (an internal address). In a network using NAT, the router or other gateway that connects the LAN to the Internet translates between internal and external IP addresses.</p><p>To prevent conflicts between local IP addresses and Internet addresses, several ranges of numbers have been reserved for use by local networks as <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0562"/>internal IP addresses. These addresses will never be found on the Internet, and they can be used on multiple local networks at the same time (so long as the networks don't have to talk to each other directly), but if you're maintaining several networks, it might help you keep your sanity to use different ranges, anyway.

The server assigns an address to each client device whenever the client joins the network, so the same client might have a different local address from one session to another; that's why it's called <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic host configuration</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0566"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0567"/></p><p>The DHCP server is usually in the router that controls all the devices in the network.

If a network does not use a DHCP server, the network manager must assign a permanent address to each client. If your network manager assigns addresses <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0569"/>manually, keep a copy of the address in a text file with a backup copy on paper. If you are the network manager, keep two or more copies of your own list of addresses as you assign them.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0570"/></p><p>The manual for your access point should specify the correct range of addresses for client devices and explain how to assign them. If you use DHCP, the server will assign them automatically. If you don't use DHCP, you must use a different address within the specified range for each device on your network (in other words, you must make sure that two or more devices don't use the same IP address).</p><p>With most DHCP servers, it's also possible to assign the same address to each client every time, which can be very helpful. How to configure this depends on your DHCP server, but it usually requires knowing either:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The name of the client (sent by most operating systems in the DHCP request), which is an arbitrary human-readable name, usually the same as the system name Windows is configured to use for filesharing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The MAC address <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0571"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0572"/>of the client, which is a 12-character address that is unique to every network card.

Each of the four numbers is usually either 255 or 0. For example, if the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 (the most common value), then all the numeric <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0575"/>IP addresses in the network must be <span class="emphasis"><em>XXX.XXX.XXX.ZZZ</em></span>, where <span class="emphasis"><em>XXX.XXX.XXX</em></span> is the same for all addresses, and <span class="emphasis"><em>ZZZ</em></span> is different in each address.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0576"/></p><p>The subnet mask must be identical for all of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-6-0577"/>access points and wireless clients served by those access points.
