Or, you may have used vector graphics before and are now checking to see what else it can do for you. Or, you may be considering Inkscape after having used other vector editing applications and would like to know what sets it apart. Whatever your situation is, you may find some background information useful. What is SVG? What is Inkscape? Where does it come from and where is it headed? What can you use it for? What is Inkscape’s place in the world of computer graphics? This introductory chapter attempts to answer these and other questions.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="1.1 What Vector Graphics Is and Why It Matters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="onedot1_what_vector_graphics_is_and_why"/>1.1 What Vector Graphics Is and Why It Matters</h1></div></div></div><p>Inkscape is a <span class="emphasis"><em>vector graphics editor</em></span>. What does that mean?</p><p>The majority of images stored and processed on computers today are represented as <span class="emphasis"><em>rasters</em></span>, also called <span class="emphasis"><em>bitmaps</em></span>. A raster image is a rather primitive representation—just a lattice of small rectangular areas called <span class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span>. For each pixel, the only information a raster file stores is its color and, possibly, its transparency.</p><p><a id="iddle1138" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1165" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1262" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1265" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2076" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2302" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3073" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3104" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3532" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3945" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4913" class="indexterm"/>For example, if you have a bitmap image with a black circle on white background (<a class="xref" href="ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr" title="Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)">Figure 1-1</a>, left), there is in fact <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> black circle stored in the image at all. It’s only you, when viewing this image, who may (or may not) get the <span class="emphasis"><em>idea</em></span> of a black circle. All the computer knows about the image is that some of its pixels are black and some are white (and a few are an in-between gray).</p><div class="figure"><a id="circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00001"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735304.png.jpg" alt="A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)</p></div><p>As a result, there is precious little that the computer can do with such an image without human guidance. It can paint all the white pixels blue, but it cannot move or transform the circle because it does not <span class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> it as a separate object. These kinds of tasks may be difficult even for humans, as anyone who has used the GIMP or Photoshop would attest; you’ll have to use complex and unreliable tools to “select” the circle, and you can hardly ever do this perfectly if, for example, the edge of the circle is <span class="emphasis"><em>antialiased</em></span> (so that some pixels on the edge have intermediate values between black and white) as it is in <a class="xref" href="ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr" title="Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)">Figure 1-1</a>.</p><p>It’s all different with <span class="emphasis"><em>vector graphics</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr" title="Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)">Figure 1-1</a>, right). In a vector format, the actual circle can be stored along with its properties as an <span class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span>. This means you can easily separate it from other objects and do whatever you please with it. Moreover, with such an image, your computer can do many smart things automatically—for example, it can automatically delete all circles, paint all red objects with green, or scale all black circles to twice their size.</p><p>No more frustrating pixel selections: Just pick any object and edit it as needed. That’s how Inkscape works, and this is its main point of difference from raster editors such as Photoshop.</p><p>Let’s look at the most prominent advantages of the vector approach:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images are scalable.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Scalability</em></span> means you can view or export your drawing at any resolution, and you’ll never see any jaggedness, pixelation, or unwanted blurring. Everything remains perfectly crisp regardless of size. This is often cited as the main advantage of vector graphics, although in my view, other advantages are no less important.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images are editable at any time.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>No matter how complex your drawing is, you can always pick any object in it and edit away. It’s a bit like a Photoshop file in which every single brush stroke is placed on a layer of its own—automatically. Furthermore, in a raster editor, you are supposed to eventually “flatten” your image, so that all separate layers are merged. By contrast, there’s no need—indeed no possibility—to flatten a vector drawing (except by exporting it to a raster image).</p></li></ul></div><p><a id="page_3"/><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images are easy to create and read.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a id="iddle1097" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1160" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1260" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1266" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1281" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2229" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2819" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3139" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4470" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4493" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4859" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4910" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4911" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4993" class="indexterm"/>Vector objects conform much better to human visual perception: When we look at a scene, we tend to mentally separate it into objects, just as is done in a vector drawing. This makes vector graphics a very natural medium to work in. Also, since many vector formats (including SVG) are text-based, it is easy to <span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> a simple vector drawing manually (without a graphic editor of any kind) or to program a script to generate or modify such a drawing.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images are laconic.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Since you don’t have to store information about every pixel, a vector image usually takes much fewer bytes to store and transmit than the corresponding raster image. As a nice side effect of this, Inkscape has unlimited undo history, simply because each undo step takes much less memory as a vector than it would as a raster.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images are infinite.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A raster always has a fixed size in pixels—for example, 468 by 60 pixels. In an uncompressed bitmap, doubling the dimensions will quadruple the size of the file because the extra pixels need to be stored even if they are empty. Not so with vector images. A vector image is virtually <span class="emphasis"><em>boundless</em></span>, and expanding it by moving an object an inch or a mile away costs nothing in terms of file size or computer memory. Similarly, a vector document is virtually infinite in terms of <span class="emphasis"><em>depth</em></span>: You can zoom in as close as you want and create any number of microscopic-sized objects in any given space. (In reality, of course, both canvas size and zoom level are limited, but these limits are much, much larger than in a raster editor.)</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images can be animated.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Since objects are stored separately in a vector drawing, it’s easy to animate them by moving them, transforming them, changing their colors, and so on. That’s why some vector formats such as SVG or Flash naturally provide animation capabilities as well. Although Inkscape does not yet support animated SVG, this feature is planned for implementation in a future release.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector images can be interactive.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Not only can you animate objects, but you can make them interactive as well. A drawing can change the properties of objects in response to user actions, which makes it possible to implement complex user interfaces with buttons, links, drag-and-drop, and so on. Again, Inkscape’s current capabilities in this area are limited, but you can manually edit an SVG file created in Inkscape, adding interactivity which can then be played in an SVG viewer.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector objects are reusable.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It’s very easy to pick an object from one drawing, transform or restyle it without any loss of quality, and then insert it into another drawing.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are into digital music, you may better understand the distinction between vector and raster graphics if I liken vector graphics to a MIDI sound file and raster graphics to a WAV sound recording. Another analogy, suited to programmers, might be to compare vectors to the source code of a program and rasters to compiled binaries.</p><p><a id="iddle1283" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1325" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2122" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2190" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2307" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2357" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2542" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3294" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3425" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3429" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3441" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3518" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4354" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4504" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4681" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4770" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4905" class="indexterm"/>Of course it can’t be all roses and no thorns. Here are the two main disadvantages of vector graphics compared to rasters:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Formats are fundamentally limited.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A vector image format (of which there are many, just as there are many different raster formats) always limits you to a certain repertoire of objects and their properties. New versions of formats invent and introduce new capabilities, but that only highlights the fact that perfection is unattainable. Vector formats are always “under construction.”</p><p>There are many images that are very difficult or even impossible to reproduce exactly in vector form. For example, images that require complex textures, such as human skin, hair, or wood, are not vector-friendly. The world of vectors is traditionally made up of precise shapes, flat colors, and smooth gradients; if what you like is naturalistic noise, scratches, or dirt, you will probably have a hard time rendering that in a typical vector editor.</p><p>Still, with Inkscape’s transparency, gradients, and filters, you can create amazingly photorealistic vector images (see Figure 1 on the color insert). Also note that, being a higher-level abstraction, a vector drawing may include raster images as a special kind of object. Thus, you can always insert a photo into an Inkscape drawing and freely combine it with vector objects.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vector format conversions are unreliable.</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>For the same reason, it is never trivial to convert an image from one vector format into another. The repertoires of object types and capabilities of the formats always differ, sometimes in less than obvious ways; different versions of formats muddy the picture even more. For example, SVG supports blurring objects (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch17s01.html" title="17.1 Blur">17.1 Blur</a></strong></span>) while PDF does not; on the other hand, PDF supports gradient meshes (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html#onedot5dot4_dot_dot_dot_and_inkscape" title="1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape">1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape</a></strong></span>), a feature presently missing in SVG. This makes any kind of vector conversion an iffy business. In the best case, you get an approximation of the source object that the target format cannot represent directly (for example, for exporting SVG to PDF, you may need to replace blurred objects with embedded rasters). In the worst case, you’ll simply get a broken image after the conversion.</p><p>This is one of the reasons Inkscape’s vector format, SVG, is so important. It is an acknowledged international standard with rich and well-defined capabilities, which therefore has the potential to become the lingua franca of vector graphics (although Adobe’s PDF is still much more common in this role). We will discuss SVG in more detail later in this chapter.</p></li></ul></div><p>So, what is actually stored in a vector drawing? Apart from the embedded raster objects just mentioned, the most common vector object type is a path. A <span class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span> is just a sequence of commands like “draw a straight line to such-and-such point” and “draw a smooth curve through such-and-such points.” There may be any number of such commands in a sequence, which means a path can approximate any geometric figure or real-world shape with any desired accuracy. A path can have <span class="emphasis"><em>fill</em></span> (paint in the area enclosed by the path) and <span class="emphasis"><em>stroke</em></span> (paint along the path itself), as well as many other properties that define how the path looks (<a class="xref" href="ch01s01.html#path_object_can_represent_any_shape" title="Figure 1-2. A path object can represent any shape.">Figure 1-2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="path_object_can_represent_any_shape"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00002"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735306.png.jpg" alt="A path object can represent any shape."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1-2. A path object can represent any shape.</p></div><p><a id="iddle1133" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1178" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1198" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1215" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1258" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1263" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1452" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1688" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1709" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1785" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1894" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2115" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2238" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2295" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2403" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2494" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2515" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2577" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2613" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2720" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2780" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2807" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2841" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2920" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3137" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3147" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3228" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3520" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3523" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3557" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3633" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3718" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4557" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4918" class="indexterm"/>There are several other object types (such as text objects, clones, and groups) and many other object properties (such as font size, visibility, and blur). Many properties can apply to all kinds of objects, while others are specific to particular object types. A drawing is just a collection of objects of various types; these objects can be placed whenever you need them, including on top of each other, and they can even be made partially or fully transparent so that whatever is beneath them shows through. Figure 1 on the color insert shows an example of a complex Inkscape drawing that makes heavy use of opacity, gradients, and blur to achieve realism (you can load it from Inkscape’s <span class="emphasis"><em>examples</em></span> directory if you want to examine it in full glory).</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="1.2 What Can You Do with Inkscape?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="onedot2_what_can_you_do_with_inkscapeque"/>1.2 What Can You Do with Inkscape?</h1></div></div></div><p>A lot.</p><p>Schemes, charts, diagrams. Plans and drafts. Scientific illustrations and data graphs. Icons, symbols, logos, and emblems. Heraldry, flags, road signs. Comics, cartoons, anime characters and scenes. Maps of lands both real and imaginary. Typography of all kinds. Banners, leaflets, posters. Web graphics. (Ads, too.) Book covers, holiday cards, headings, and vignettes. Kids’ scribbles and stunning photorealistic art. Fantasy art, fan art, games art, and simply art of all flavors and varieties.</p><p>One of the goals of this book is to demonstrate that vector editing tools are applicable to a much wider range of tasks than is usually acknowledged. In fact, instead of trying to list all of the purposes for which Inkscape may be used, it’s easier to describe situations where its use may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be appropriate. Let’s try to define the borders of the Inkscape universe:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Many tasks with photos or any other <span class="strong"><strong>preexisting raster graphics</strong></span>, such as color corrections, retouching, and format or size conversions, are better done in raster editors such as the GIMP or Photoshop. Of all the limitations of vector images, this one is the best known because it separates the two commonly contrasted kinds of graphic tools: vector and raster. Note that some raster-related tasks—such as adding callouts or marks, drawing shapes over a bitmap background, masking (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch18s04.html" title="18.4 Clipping and Masking">18.4 Clipping and Masking</a></strong></span>), or even simple retouching (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch18s05.html" title="18.5 Retouching and Patching">18.5 Retouching and Patching</a></strong></span>)—can still be done quite naturally in Inkscape.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Drawing with <span class="strong"><strong>natural-media tools</strong></span>—those emulating oils, pastels, watercolors, and so on—is best done in specialized raster tools such as Krita, Corel Painter, or ArtRage. More generally, this applies to any art where the <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span> of the colored surface is paramount. Still, if you care more about shape and color <a id="iddle1022" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1083" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1132" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1168" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1205" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1206" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1321" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1367" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1379" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1568" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1666" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1783" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1836" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1847" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2265" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2555" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2556" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2684" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2861" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3186" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3249" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3577" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3583" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3595" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3608" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3874" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4143" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4516" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4560" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4574" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4583" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4919" class="indexterm"/>than about texture, or if your art looks good with just flat color, gradients, and blurs, Inkscape is one of the best tools for “simply drawing” (<a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Drawing">Chapter 14</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Producing <span class="strong"><strong>text-rich multipage documents</strong></span>, especially with complex features such as footnotes, index, or a table of contents, is naturally the domain of page layout software (such as Scribus or Adobe InDesign) or batch formatters (such as TEX or Apache FOP). Inkscape, however, works very well for graphics-rich single-page documents such as posters or leaflets, and you can even use it for some multipage designs by storing each page in a separate document or layer (it does not yet support multiple pages within one document). Also, as of this writing, Inkscape lacks proper CMYK support, which limits its usefulness for print work.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>While Inkscape’s 3D Box tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html" title="11.3 3D Boxes">11.3 3D Boxes</a></strong></span>) can be used for simple <span class="strong"><strong>three-dimensional drafts and scenes</strong></span>, it implements the approach of a traditional artist working on a 2D drawing depicting 3D objects, not of a 3D artist creating a 3D world. In other words, if you need a one-time drawing of a simple 3D scene, you can use Inkscape to get a nice-looking and geometrically correct result. If, however, you want several renditions of the same complex scene from different angles or a 3D animation, use some real 3D software instead (Blender, Maya, or SketchUp, to name just a few).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You can do some simple <span class="strong"><strong>CAD</strong></span> (Computer-Aided Design; this term usually applies to engineering drawings) work in Inkscape. Inkscape provides ways to draw and transform objects precisely, as well as a plethora of snapping, alignment, and distribution features. However, Inkscape does not support features like parametric modeling, nor does it yet have any libraries of CAD elements (such as screws or tubes) that are essential to professional CAD work. While you may try to borrow such elements elsewhere, in most cases it is still better to use a specialized tool such as QCad or AutoCAD.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Inkscape has a dedicated Connector tool that you can use to draw pretty complex <span class="strong"><strong>diagrams and flowcharts</strong></span> with automatically routed connectors. However, this tool is currently rather limited, and there are no collections of predefined diagram elements that you can easily reuse in Inkscape. So, if you need to create many standardized diagrams, look into specialized tools such as Visio or Dia.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some people have successfully used Inkscape for <span class="strong"><strong>presentations</strong></span>. With its ease of manipulating objects and its many eye candy effects, Inkscape is a very attractive choice when you need to quickly build a presentation. You can create and reuse a page template with headers and placeholder text (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html" title="3.2 Document Templates">3.2 Document Templates</a></strong></span>). Inkscape even includes a stand-alone SVG viewer (Inkview) with fullscreen mode and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00001"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735308.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> key for the “show next” command, which is typically all you need for displaying a presentation whose pages are saved in separate SVG documents. An office presentation application such as PowerPoint or OpenOffice.org Impress may still have its advantages, although these programs tend to feel quite clumsy once you get used to Inkscape’s graphic power. Some people use Inkscape for drawing the graphics and a presentation application for adding text and creating the actual presentation. Also, a <a id="iddle1161" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1217" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1484" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2100" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2261" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2298" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2615" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2701" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2793" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3613" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4263" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4912" class="indexterm"/>third-party extension called JessyInk (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/p/jessyink">http://code.google.com/p/jessyink</a></em></span>) will turn your multilayer SVG document into an multipage presentation that can be viewed in Firefox or another SVG-capable browser.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Inkscape’s extension effects (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch13s03.html" title="13.3 Path Extensions">13.3 Path Extensions</a></strong></span>) can render a lot of interesting graphic artifacts such as Lindenmeyer systems, random trees, spirograph curves, or barcodes. New effects are easy to program, too. However, if what you need is some complex <span class="strong"><strong>algorithmic art</strong></span> (such as fractals), you may want to use specialized software and import the result into Inkscape.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Inkscape does not yet support <span class="strong"><strong>animation</strong></span>. So, while you can use it for drawing animation scenes, characters, and even complete frames, you will still need a different application (such as Adobe Flash) to combine these elements and manage the timeline of your animation.</p></li></ul></div><p>Admittedly fuzzy (and quickly changing), these are the current frontiers of the vector graphics land. Everything within these boundaries is the rightful domain of a modern vector editor such as Inkscape.</p><p>Note that only some of these limits are inherent in vector graphics as such. Others are just current limitations of Inkscape, likely to be overcome with time. (They may be already obsolete by the time you’re reading this—check out the latest version.)</p><p>Curiously, a lot of people roam the outer graphics lands but are quite unaware about the vector heartland. As a result, they often frustrate themselves trying to use their favorite specialized tool for the wrong generic task. Well-known examples are Microsoft Office users struggling with PowerPoint whenever they need to make any kind of picture or layout, or novices complaining in forums about how difficult it is to draw simple geometric shapes in the GIMP. These are typical cases of acute vector blindness; do not fall prey to this disease!</p><p>The vector land is also the place where a lot of project roadmaps begin. No matter what kind of project I am starting and what software I will eventually use, my first step is usually to open Inkscape and start making quick drafts. Only when I run into some of the limitations listed above might I move on to more specialized applications to complete my project. And, increasingly, I find that I don’t really need to leave Inkscape to finish what I started. Inkscape’s universe keeps expanding.</p></div>

Not only SVG, but PDF and AI files<sup>[<a id="ch01fn01" href="#ftn.ch01fn01" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> can be the source of vector images for your designs. PostScript and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) are supported to a lesser extent. CDR (CorelDRAW) files can also be imported, and future versions are likely to support the XAR (Xara Xtreme) format as well.</p><p>Also, nothing prevents you from importing a bitmap file into Inkscape and either using it “as is” in your design, or taking advantage of Inkscape’s versatile bitmap tracer (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch18s08.html#one8dot8dot2_the_trace_bitmap_dialog" title="18.8.2 The Trace Bitmap Dialog">18.8.2 The Trace Bitmap Dialog</a></strong></span>) to convert it to vector shapes.</p><p>Even if you don’t use clipart, learning is always a good reason to download the SVG source of an image you find interesting. Unlike a bitmap, a vector image contains a lot of information about the way it was created, and in Inkscape you can examine that information in detail. The correspondence between visible areas and objects, the types of these objects, their properties, grouping and layer structures—all these aspects are very instructive for anyone studying Inkscape or SVG techniques.</p><p>Inkscape’s files are easy to find online compared to most other vector tools. It shouldn’t be surprising given that its native format, SVG, is human-readable and naturally web friendly (it is directly supported by most recent browsers). Moreover, as open source software, Inkscape promotes a culture of sharing that extends to its graphics as well.

What is SVG?</p><p>The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) standard was born at the height of the XML revolution of the late 1990s. In those days, when the lure of simple yet <a id="iddle1162" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1326" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1565" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1868" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2191" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2239" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2525" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2578" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2691" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2855" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2858" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2914" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3423" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3559" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4471" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4479" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4482" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4497" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4505" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4507" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4518" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4611" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4924" class="indexterm"/>infinitely expressive XML was fresh, people wanted to create XML vocabularies for <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>. Vector graphics presented itself as a natural candidate. In 1998, a new working group was formed at W3C, the international consortium that is behind the most commonly used Web standards, including HTML and XML. That group included representatives of (among others) Adobe, Microsoft, and Macromedia. The first fruit of their labors, SVG 1.0, appeared in 2001; the most recent official version is 1.1, published in 2003. The next version, 1.2, is under development, and parts of it are already finalized.</p><p>Stemming from the long and often convoluted history of vector formats, SVG tried hard to do things the right way from the beginning. It inherited a lot of good stuff from PostScript and PDF (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html#onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector" title="1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats">1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats</a></strong></span>) but was designed to be free from their limitations. SVG natively supports transparency, gradients, Unicode for text, and many other conveniences that are taken for granted in the 21st century. It also adds unique filter effects (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Filters">Chapter 17</a>), which are basically raster operations (such as blur) that can be applied to an object without losing its vector editability and resolution independence.</p><p>Since SVG was designed for the Web, and the most common vector format on the Web was (and is) Flash, SVG also includes quite comprehensive animation features. Version 1.2, still under development, adds more goodies: flowed text, vector effects including nondestructive Boolean operations, device-independent CMYK color, and more.</p><p>Currently, all modern browsers support SVG to a varying extent, the only exception being (you guessed it) Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. (For IE, SVG viewer plugins exist, one of which—now discontinued—was developed by Adobe.) This means that you can load any of your Inkscape SVG files into Firefox the same way you would load a JPG or HTML file, and the browser will display your vector graphic exactly as it looked in Inkscape.</p><p>SVG is a large and complex standard, and few software supports all of it. Inkscape’s support of SVG is also limited; most notably, it ignores SVG fonts (just like PDF, an SVG document can embed its own fonts) and cannot do animation. Some smaller features are also missing; for example, references to resources (such as gradients or symbols) only work within the same document. It is a stated goal of the Inkscape project to eventually support all of SVG.</p><p>When you save an Inkscape document, you have a choice of two SVG formats: <span class="emphasis"><em>Plain SVG</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Inkscape SVG</em></span>. Plain SVG is just that: pure SVG 1.1 code and nothing else. Inkscape SVG, however, adds quite a number of elements and attributes in Inkscape’s private namespace.</p><p>Don’t be afraid of Inkscape SVG! It is perfectly valid and standard-compliant SVG; the goal of these additional elements and attributes is just to provide Inkscape-specific metadata <span class="emphasis"><em>about</em></span> the SVG objects, not to add some incompatible objects of Inkscape’s own. Inkscape extensions may affect how objects <span class="emphasis"><em>behave</em></span> when you edit them in Inkscape, but they never affect how the document is <span class="emphasis"><em>rendered</em></span>.<sup>[<a id="ch01fn03" href="#ftn.ch01fn03" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> Therefore, Inkscape SVG and Plain SVG versions of the same file will look exactly the same in any compliant SVG renderer.

Compressed files have the extension <span class="emphasis"><em>.svgz</em></span>; unlike SVG, they are not human-readable but take much less space on disk. Most programs will read SVGZ files just as easily as they read SVG.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch01fn03" href="#ch01fn03" class="para">3</a>] </sup>See <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15s02.html#one5dot2dot2_flowed_text" title="15.2.2 Flowed Text">15.2.2 Flowed Text</a></strong></span> for an exception, however.</p></div></div></div>

There have existed and still exist dozens of vector editors: commercial and open source, for different platforms, generic and specialized, alive and dead. Only a few of them, however, deserve to be mentioned here. Currently, all of Inkscape’s serious competitors are commercial (and often quite costly) applications, usually limited to the Windows and Mac platforms, which means Inkscape’s zero cost and cross-platform availability immediately give it a competitive advantage.</p><div class="sect2" title="1.5.1 Adobe Illustrator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="onedot5dot1_adobe_illustrator"/>1.5.1 Adobe Illustrator</h2></div></div></div><p>Adobe Illustrator takes the indisputable first place in this list. An immensely powerful and feature-packed application, it is usually considered the leader in the field and a de facto standard in vector graphics. Even if you don’t use Illustrator, you are likely to run across mentions of its features and versions, comparisons of other programs to it, and of course AI-created vector files in various formats (including SVG).</p><p>No doubt much of Illustrator’s clout is channeled from its much more famous cousin, Adobe Photoshop. Positioned as parts of the same creative suite, Photoshop and Illustrator share many UI traits and are optimized for working together. However, compared to Photoshop, Illustrator’s position in its field is fortunately much less of a monopoly. Even without Inkscape, it still has very serious competition, although its prominence has been growing in the recent years.</p><p>Dating from the late 1980s, Illustrator has had a long and winding history. It wasn’t always the dominant player in vector graphics. Many of its features were pioneered in competing packages and, sometimes only after several years, were reimplmented in AI. By now, however, it’s so big—and growing bigger with every version, especially if you consider the rest of Adobe’s Creative Suite as well as a whole industry of third-party AI plugins—that any generalizations are risky. Illustrator is a lot of things to a lot of people.</p><p>And yet, I think I can risk one such generalization: Whatever its capabilities, few people will claim Illustrator’s UI as a paragon of usability. Critics (admittedly mostly users of competing packages) cite a cluttered interface dominated by a swarm of floating dialogs, too many tools with too narrow functions, limited on-canvas editability of objects’ properties, and scarcity of context information. Competing editors also often claim a speed edge over AI.</p><div class="note" title="AI"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01note01"/>AI</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>I’m not trying to write a comprehensive migration guide for AI users. Still, throughout the book, I will provide the AI equivalents and comparisons for some of Inkscape’s features.</em></span></p></div><div class="sect3" title="1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector"/>1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1566" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3560" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3567" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3570" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3590" class="indexterm"/>Vector formats associated with Illustrator, and with Adobe in general, play a crucial role in the modern digital world. You need to have an idea of what PostScript and PDF are, how they are related, and what they are capable of, even if you’re not planning to use anything but SVG with Inkscape.</p><p>Adobe’s first claim to fame, back in 1984, was creating the grandfather of all vector graphic formats: <span class="emphasis"><em>PostScript</em></span>. Designed as a standard for sending data to printers, it was ready just in time to become a major component of the “desktop publishing revolution” of the 1980s, driven by accessible personal computers and laser printers.</p><p>PostScript was (and is) quite unusual in that it is a complete <span class="emphasis"><em>programming language</em></span> and not just a data format. A PostScript file is actually a program that a printer or computer must run in order to get an image. For example, a PostScript file may contain an instruction to print a text line, such as “I must not disrupt the class,” and a loop that will repeat this line a hundred times. Unfortunately, this also means that, due to an error in the program or someone’s malicious intent, a PostScript program might run indefinitely, tying up the system’s resources.</p><p>On the positive side, PostScript’s interpreter used little memory and could therefore be embedded in the hardware of the day. As a result, it became popular with printer makers and soon was the de facto standard for sending files to print.</p><p>It was also used as the base for the native file format of the first versions of Adobe Illustrator, which appeared about that time. Even though the AI file format changed in many ways with every version of the application, for a long time its foundation remained the same: An AI file was simply PostScript that followed certain conventions and used PS function libraries from Adobe.</p><p>Unfortunately for the users of Illustrator, PostScript’s priorities as a print language were in addressing the concerns of printer makers rather than becoming a generalized vector graphics language. For example, Level 2 of PostScript (1991) added device-independent CMYK color, but it wasn’t until Level 3 (1997) that such a basic thing as gradients became directly possible. (Until PS 3, applications wishing to create a gradient in PostScript had to “fake” it by overlaying many narrow strips of gradually changing color.) And even today, PostScript still does not support transparency natively.</p><p>This is undoubtedly one of the reasons why early versions of Illustrator were so slow to gain the new features that users demanded (and that competing vector editors were already providing). To this day, Illustrator’s UI bears marks of being built with the PostScript feature set in mind, with everything else treated as an afterthought.</p><p>However, the biggest issue with PostScript is not its feature limitations. Over time, its being a programming language proved to be much more of a burden: What was once a clever hack in the late 1980s is now regarded as very cumbersome and dangerous. Since any PostScript file is a program, you simply cannot tell what exactly this file will display except by <span class="emphasis"><em>running</em></span> that program. This means you need a complete PostScript interpreter in order to do even the simplest <a id="iddle1096" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1121" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1125" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1128" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1701" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1708" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1807" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2029" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2263" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2286" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2550" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2553" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2820" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3424" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3436" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3443" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3562" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3568" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4054" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4109" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4751" class="indexterm"/>processing of PostScript files, and you cannot directly combine two PostScript files into a single document with predictable results.</p><p>Adobe tried to rectify this by imposing various limitations on PostScript files. One such limitation was the <span class="emphasis"><em>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)</em></span> format. An EPS file is simply a one-page PostScript document that can be reliably inserted into other documents. However, this was obviously not enough.</p><p>So in 1993, Adobe took a more drastic step: It introduced <span class="emphasis"><em>Portable Document Format (PDF)</em></span>. This format, although based on PostScript, drops the idea of being a programming language. At first, PDF was just simplified PS rewritten in a declarative fashion with added compression and some top-level document management features. Later, Adobe went on to develop PDF well past what was ever available in PostScript; for example, transparency was added in PDF version 1.4 (2001).</p><p>Although PDF’s stated goal was Internet document exchange, it became popular and eventually started gaining a foothold in print and design as well. The fact that PDF is an open format, standardized by ISO and free for implementation by anyone, also helped. By now, PDF has largely replaced PS in most commercial applications, including print.</p><p>More importantly for our discussion, with version 9.0 (2000), Adobe Illustrator switched its native AI file format to one based on PDF instead of on PostScript. This means that any AI file saved in a modern version of Adobe Illustrator is in fact PDF and can be viewed and imported by any software that supports PDF. For example, Inkscape’s AI importer is actually the same as its PDF importer.</p><p>In summary, at this point in time it really makes no sense to use PostScript or EPS if you can use PDF instead. Inkscape can import PS and EPS, but only by converting them into PDF first, which requires the free cross-platform Ghostscript package (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="apbs04.html" title="B.4 PostScript and EPS (Import, Export)">B.4 PostScript and EPS (Import, Export)</a></strong></span>) to be installed on your system. Exporting from Inkscape to PDF gives better results than exporting to PostScript.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="1.5.2 CorelDRAW"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="onedot5dot2_coreldraw"/>1.5.2 CorelDRAW</h2></div></div></div><p>Currently, Illustrator’s biggest rival is CorelDRAW. Like Illustrator, it is a large, full-featured application and is part of a suite of graphic applications. Here, however, the similarities end.</p><p>CorelDRAW has always positioned itself as a vector editor “for the rest of us.” Priced lower than Illustrator or Freehand (the main contender of Illustrator back in early 1990s, now bought out by Adobe and discontinued), CorelDRAW has always emphasized ease of use and, during the 1990s, greatly expanded the audience of vector editing tools. In some countries and communities, it was, and still is, more popular than Illustrator.</p><p>CorelDRAW pioneered some valuable UI concepts that were passed down to a number of other applications, including Inkscape. For example, the single Selector tool that can do all kinds of selections and transformations (move and scale, then click once and you can rotate and skew) first appeared in CorelDRAW; Illustrator and Freehand have separate “select,” “scale,” and “rotate” tools instead.</p><p>It has also introduced the notion of shapes (such as rectangles or ellipses) as separate object types, with the path editing tool acting differently on the shapes <a id="iddle1123" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1166" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1673" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1710" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3185" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4945" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4950" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4951" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4952" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4954" class="indexterm"/>than on plain paths. Incredibly enough, Illustrator still has no concept of shapes; any rectangle in Illustrator is just a rectangular path, with no rectangle-specific properties.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="1.5.3 Xara"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="onedot5dot3_xara"/>1.5.3 Xara</h2></div></div></div><p>CorelDRAW was, and still is, an impressive improvement over Illustrator in terms of usability. However, a lot more could be done in this area, as Xara Ltd., a small British company, managed to prove. In the mid-1990s, Xara ported its vector editor from the little-known Atari platform to Windows. The result was one of the most impressive debuts in computer graphics.</p><p>Xara’s vector editor scored a number of important firsts. It featured complete on-screen antialiasing, on-canvas editing of gradients with convenient handles, convenient transparency support, and a context-sensitive panel with controls relevant to the current tool (despite the obviousness of the idea, it’s something Illustrator didn’t have until version CS2). On top of that, Xara was very fast, which was especially important with the hardware of the day.</p><p>In general, Xara had followed the CorelDRAW UI paradigm (so much so that for a time, Corel even distributed Xara under the name of CorelXARA, as a kind of a little brother to its CorelDRAW). However, the advantage in usability Xara held over CorelDRAW was even greater than the latter’s advantage over the clunky Illustrator. Xara soon acquired a sizeable and very loyal user base. It’s no wonder Inkscape has borrowed a lot of ideas and approaches from Xara.</p><p>However, over the years, Xara’s novelty faded somewhat. Xara released several new versions, but so did its competitors, inventing new features and improving usability. By the mid-2000s, Xara was perceived by most people as a “nice little app”—very solid and usable, but somewhat passe.</p><p>In 2005, Xara Ltd. took an unprecedented step: It announced its plans to release as open source—and port to Linux—its flagship product, the vector graphic editor, whose most recent version was called Xara Xtreme. The Linux version was to be called Xara LX. This looked like, but actually wasn’t, one of the “better to be open source than abandonware” scenarios. Xara remained in business, continuing to sell the Windows version of Xara Xtreme as well as other graphic products.</p><p>Interestingly, one of the reasons for the plunge quoted by Xara Ltd. was the rapid progress of Inkscape. Although much younger than Xara, Inkscape already had some unique features. Apparently, Xara wanted to tap into the open source talent pool to revitalize its product. On the other hand, Inkscape developers had always acknowledged Xara, with its consistent interface design and excellent usability, as one if its role models. So, even though these two applications had been aware of each other before, now for the first time they met face-to-face as competitors.</p><p>Indeed, due to its presence on Linux and general similarity of the UI, Xara is currently Inkscape’s most direct competitor. At first, both projects declared themselves open and willing to exchange code and ideas, and there was even talk of an eventual merger. However, after the initial spurt of activity, Xara LX failed to attract significant attention from open source developers, mostly because <a id="iddle1023" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1108" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1344" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1348" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1555" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1569" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1712" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1848" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2276" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2308" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2371" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2379" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2565" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2573" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2579" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2584" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2593" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2607" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2614" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2695" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2712" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4487" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4785" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4946" class="indexterm"/>Xara Ltd. refused to release as open source one crucial part of the code—the renderer. Currently at version 0.7, Xara LX is basically usable, but its future is unclear.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="onedot5dot4_dot_dot_dot_and_inkscape"/>1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape</h2></div></div></div><p>Compared to its commercial competition, Inkscape still scores low in several respects. Of the missing features, perhaps the most important is the lack of native CMYK support, which makes it hardly usable for creating files for print (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#eightdot2dot2_cmyk" title="8.2.2 CMYK">8.2.2 CMYK</a></strong></span>). Also, Inkscape has no gradient meshes. This is a feature of AI and some other applications that allows different colors to be assigned to different points of a single object, with smooth transitions between the colors. Gradient meshes allow AI artists to create extremely photorealistic art with a minimum of objects. On the other hand, Inkscape already has some innovative features that are pretty much unique in its field, such as the clone tiler (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html" title="16.6 Tiling Clones">16.6 Tiling Clones</a></strong></span>), 3D Box tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html" title="11.3 3D Boxes">11.3 3D Boxes</a></strong></span>), path effects (<a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Editing Paths">Chapter 12</a>), and parts of the Tweak tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html" title="8.7 Color Tweaking">8.7 Color Tweaking</a></strong></span>).</p><p>The most obvious reason why some features are not yet implemented in Inkscape is that they are missing in SVG. In particular, this is the case for the gradient meshes (although they are being considered for the next version of SVG standard). Similarly, Inkscape implements SVG’s linear and elliptic gradients (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10s01.html" title="10.1 The Gradient Tool">10.1 The Gradient Tool</a></strong></span>) but lacks other gradient types, such as conical supported by Xara. The same reason is behind the impossibility to create multiple-page documents in Inkscape. This is simply not provided for in the SVG standard at this time.</p><p>Fortunately, the only area where the limitations of SVG matter for Inkscape is the repertoire of basic object types. In its ways of manipulating these objects and combining them into higher-level objects, on the other hand, Inkscape is entirely free to innovate.</p><p>In interface and usability, Inkscape is often acknowledged to be quite easy to learn and work with. Inkscape’s UI is comparable, and in fact quite similar, to that of Xara. Some things are done more conveniently in one of these programs than the other, but both feature an unobtrusive, streamlined interface with a lot of easily accessible power.</p><p>As a true open source application, Inkscape is coded mostly by geeks, and geeks’ interests and priorities are sometimes quite different from those of commercial developers. For one thing, geeks hate dumbed-down interfaces and enjoy powerful controls and unlimited tweaking. They especially appreciate rich keyboard control, and Inkscape has an unprecedented number of keyboard shortcuts covering most of its modes, tools, commands, and features (<a class="xref" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Keyboard Shortcuts">Appendix D</a>).</p><p>Not any less important than features and usability are an application’s stability and speed. Inkscape’s released versions may crash or freeze occasionally (save often!), but generally stability is not a concern for most users. Speed, however, is. Inkscape’s screen update speed is far from stellar, and although it is improving with every new version, it may very well become a problem with complex graphics.</p><p>Ironically, a few years ago when Inkscape was, overall, significantly slower than it is now, complaints about its speed were rare; in fact, most users considered it pretty snappy. Now, however, even though the screen update is faster and the program is much more responsive, complaints about Inkscape’s slowness and <a id="iddle1702" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2258" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2294" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2296" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2305" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2707" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2787" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4199" class="indexterm"/>memory consumption are starting to really pile up.<sup>[<a id="ch01fn04" href="#ftn.ch01fn04" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> The reason for this apparent paradox is simple: Inkscape has grown and matured enough to take on some really complex tasks, and artists using it on complex artwork start to hit the ceiling more and more often.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch01fn04" href="#ch01fn04" class="para">4</a>] </sup>Along with every speed optimization, there usually comes some exciting new feature that increases the performance demands again. This is what happened in version 0.45, for example. That release introduced <span class="emphasis"><em>interruptible display</em></span>, so you don’t need to wait for it to finish redrawing the screen before you can issue a command. This greatly improved the responsiveness of the program. However, the same version also added Gaussian blur (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch17s01.html" title="17.1 Blur">17.1 Blur</a></strong></span>) which, especially in its original implementation, rendered dramatically slower than anything else in Inkscape. As a result, 0.45 received more complaints about slowness than any previous release.</p></div></div></div>

What helped Inkscape succeed where other open source attempts (and there were quite a number of them) failed? Let’s take a brief look at Inkscape’s past.</p><p>The story of Inkscape begins almost simultaneously with that of SVG, except that that first chunk of code wasn’t yet called Inkscape. It was called <span class="emphasis"><em>Gill</em></span> and was the creation of a single person, Raph Levien, who in early 1999 hacked away at a simple viewer and editor for the new vector format, then under discussion by the W3C. It was a typical one-man project, and it suffered the fate of many one-man projects: Its author soon lost interest in it.</p><p>But the Gill code was publicly available, and another person picked up the development. Lauris Kaplinski renamed the project <span class="emphasis"><em>Sodipodi</em></span> and set a much more ambitious goal for it: Develop a real vector editor with most of the bells and whistles usually associated with this genre, with the UI largely modeled on CorelDRAW but also influenced by the GIMP, a well-known open source bitmap editor.</p><p>The first releases of Sodipodi were done by Lauris alone and attracted little attention. By 2002, however, more and more people were discovering Sodipodi, and patches from other developers started flowing in. Yet, Lauris remained the sole maintainer of the application; he decided which patches would go in and when the releases would be made. Few people other than him had commit rights to the project’s code repository.</p><p>Lauris did a great amount of work on Sodipodi; to this day, a sizeable portion of Inkscape’s code bears his copyright. However, with time, his autocratic way of steering the project was becoming more and more of an obstacle. Patches being ignored for a long time and disagreements erupting over the development direction weren’t healthy.</p><p>In October 2003, things came to a head. A group of dissatisfied developers, after failing to reach an agreement with Lauris, declared a fork. They took the latest Sodipodi codebase, added their patches, and coined a cool name for the new project: Inkscape.<sup>[<a id="ch01fn05" href="#ftn.ch01fn05" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup> For a short while, Inkscape and Sodipodi were being <a id="iddle2566" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2576" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2590" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2611" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2617" class="indexterm"/>developed in parallel, but the latter soon entered hibernation, unable to keep up with its young rival.</p><p>In contrast with its predecessor, the Inkscape project is very open. No single person has the supreme say on how things are to be done. To be granted full developer rights, including the right to commit directly to the code repository, you need to submit just two successful patches. Especially in Inkscape’s early days, very little discussion was taking place at all; if someone took active interest in some aspect of the program, others just assumed that that person knew what he or she was doing and didn’t interfere.</p><p>Over time, a number of guiding principles have emerged, and now it is not uncommon to see a contribution rejected if it contradicts the developers’ idea of how things should work. However, there’s still no top authority figure; everything is being decided by discussion and consensus. This means that anyone who’s passionate enough to persuade others <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> can code efficiently still has a good chance of influencing the overall direction of the project.</p><p>Among the guiding principles of the project there’s a simple rule: <span class="emphasis"><em>Listen to the users.</em></span> This sounds commonplace, but it is surprising how few software projects, be they commercial or open source, actually follow this. In Inkscape, it really helps that many of the developers are themselves active users of the program. Also, in its early days, Inkscape had to win over Sodipodi’s users in order to survive at all; fortunately, the tradition of taking user feedback seriously has continued even after Sodipodi stopped being a competitor (and it’s not like Inkscape suffers a shortage of other competitors).</p><p>Another rule of the project is, <span class="emphasis"><em>Patch first, discuss later.</em></span> That means if you have an idea and can code, don’t try to talk others into implementing it; do it yourself and let others test it live in the program. If it’s any good, your fellow developers will help you make it perfect. (If it’s not, you will just have to back it out, that’s all.)</p><p>One consequence of the “patch first” rule is the policy that development builds must always be workable; any regressions are noted and fixed as early as possible. A community of enthusiastic users downloads the most up-to-date code daily and tests it, long before an official release is even on the horizon. Developers encourage this constant testing and work to facilitate it by providing new compiled binaries for all major platforms every day.</p><p>The result has been fast and steady growth of the project, which is now widely acknowledged as one of the most important open source projects and a strong competitor in its software domain. In terms of numbers, as of this writing Inkscape has:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Almost half a million lines of code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Over 100 developers (though at any given time, the active core is about 10 people)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Over 3 million downloads only from the official site</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A user interface translated into more than 50 languages</p></li></ul></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch01fn05" href="#ch01fn05" class="para">5</a>] </sup>If you’re wondering how it was possible to take someone’s copyrighted code and start changing and renaming it, read the copy of the General Public License (the file <span class="emphasis"><em>COPYING</em></span>) that comes with your copy of Inkscape.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
