  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) is an open source printing system that
    provides a common interface to support printers in Unix-based systems. It also
    provides a standardized and modular platform that allows the use of external filters
    like Foomatic and Ghostscript for expanded printer compatibility. CUPS is licensed
    under the GNU GPL and has become the standard printing system for a large number
    of Linux distributions as well as Mac OS X.

- en: CUPS is composed of a print spooler, filters, and backends. It uses the Internet
    Printing Protocol (IPP) to accept print jobs from clients on the network. The
    print data is then stored in a print spool or queue until the printer is ready
    to accept a print job. When the printer is ready, CUPS sends the print job through
    filters that convert the print job data into a language the printer understands.
    The converted data then travels through a backend to the intended printer. Common
    backends include Universal Serial Bus (USB) and parallel interfaces.

- en: Most printers communicate using either PostScript or Printer Control Language
    (PCL). PostScript was developed at Adobe Systems in the mid-1980s to create a
    standard language for both document exchange and printer communication. CUPS can
    print to virtually all printers that support PostScript. However, PostScript printers
    are notoriously expensive due to the cost of licensing the technology from Adobe.
    PCL was created by Hewlett-Packard in 1984 and didn't carry the licensing restrictions
    of PostScript. This has created a large market of low cost PCL printers. To support
    this large market, projects like Gimp-Print were started to develop Unix drivers
    for PCL printers. HP has responded to the need for Unix-based drivers with the
    Hewlett-Packard Inkjet Driver Project. Gimp-Print and the HP Inkjet Driver Project
    greatly expand CUPS support for non-PostScript printers.

- en: CUPS was created by Michael Sweet and first released in 1999 by Easy Software
    Products, a company he co-founded with Andrew Senft. CUPS was originally designed
    around the 30-year-old Line Printing Daemon (LPD) protocol common in Unix systems.
    The emergence of IPP ultimately resulted in the switch from the LPD protocol to
    the more scalable IPP protocol.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, two categories of printers exist, PostScript and PCL. PostScript
    is an industry-standard page description language. The language was developed
    by Adobe Systems in the mid-1980s to allow the sharing of electronic documents
    while preserving formatting and appearance. It is similar to the PDF (Portable
    Document Format), also developed by Adobe. PostScript printers are usually more
    expensive than non-PostScript printers. High-end business laser printers usually
    include PostScript support. PCL printers include most consumer-oriented inkjet
    and laser printers. Most low-cost printers do not support the PostScript language.
    This means drivers must be installed that are specific to the make and model of
    the printer. Finding and installing drivers compatible with the CUPS system can
    be a challenging task. This guide provides installation instructions for the Gutenprint
    and HPLIP drivers. Many popular consumer printers are covered by at least one
    of these two drivers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CUPS system contains native support for virtually all PostScript printers
    provided you have the matching PostScript Printer Description file for the printer.
    The PPD file is usually included with the software that is bundled with the printer.
    Many PPD files are also freely available at [http://linuxprinting.org](http://linuxprinting.org).

    printer, check [http://hplip.sourceforge.net](http://hplip.sourceforge.net) to
    see if your printer is supported by the HPLIP driver. If your printer is from
    another manufacturer, check [http://linuxprinting.org](http://linuxprinting.org)

    more functionality or flexibility, consider using Samba to manage print privileges.

    printers, however, exhibit problems with this mode. If you experience slower than
    typical print times, you might try changing the default interrupt-driven mode
    to polling mode with the following command:'
