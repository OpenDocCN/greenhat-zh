    might use to circumvent security controls and gain access to an organization’s
    systems. Penetration testing is more than running scanners and automated tools
    and then writing a report. And you won’t become an expert penetration tester overnight;
    it takes years of practice and real-world experience to become proficient.

- en: Currently, there is a shift in the way people regard and define penetration
    testing within the security industry. The *Penetration Testing Execution Standard
    (PTES)* is redefining the penetration test in ways that will affect both new and
    experienced penetration testers, and it has been adopted by several leading members
    of the security community. Its charter is to define and raise awareness about
    what a true penetration test means by establishing a baseline of fundamental principles
    required to conduct a penetration test. If you’re new to penetration testing or
    unfamiliar with PTES, visit [http://www.pentest-standard.org/](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)

    organization that a standardized level of effort will be expended in a penetration
    test by anyone conducting this type of assessment. The standard is divided into
    seven categories with different levels of effort required for each, depending
    on the organization under attack.

    penetration test — one without restrictions regarding what can and will be tested

- en: In the *intelligence gathering* phase, you will gather any information you can
    about the organization you are attacking by using social-media networks, Google
    hacking, footprinting the target, and so on. One of the most important skills
    a penetration tester can have is the ability to learn about a target, including
    how it behaves, how it operates, and how it ultimately can be attacked. The information
    that you gather about your target will give you valuable insight into the types
    of security controls in place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During intelligence gathering, you attempt to identify what protection mechanisms
    are in place at the target by slowly starting to probe its systems. For example,
    an organization will often only allow traffic on a certain subset of ports on
    externally facing devices, and if you query the organization on anything other
    than a whitelisted port, you will be blocked. It is generally a good idea to test
    this blocking behavior by initially probing from an expendable IP address that
    you are willing to have blocked or detected. The same holds true when you’re testing
    web applications, where, after a certain threshold, the web application firewalls
    will block you from making further requests.

- en: To remain undetected during these sorts of tests, you can perform your initial
    scans from IP address ranges that can’t be linked back to you and your team. Typically,
    organizations with an external presence on the Internet experience attacks every
    day, and your initial probing will likely be an undetected part of the background
    noise.

    that you’ve learned from the prior phases and use it to understand what attacks
    might be viable. Among other things, vulnerability analysis takes into account
    port and vulnerability scans, data gathered by banner grabbing, and information
    collected during intelligence gathering.

- en: '*Exploitation* is probably one of the most glamorous parts of a penetration
    test, yet it is often done with brute force rather than with precision. An exploit
    should be performed only when you know almost beyond a shadow of a doubt that
    a particular exploit will be successful. Of course, unforeseen protective measures
    might be in place on the target that prevent a particular exploit from working
    — but before you trigger a vulnerability, you should know that the system is vulnerable.
    Blindly firing off a mass onslaught of exploits and praying for a shell isn’t
    productive; it is noisy and provides little if any value to you as a penetration
    tester or to your client. Do your homework first, and then launch well-researched
    exploits that are likely to succeed.'

    systems — but you’re not even close to being done yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Post exploitation is a critical component in any penetration test. This is where
    you differentiate yourself from the average, run-of-the-mill hacker and actually
    provide valuable information and intelligence from your penetration test. Post
    exploitation targets specific systems, identifies critical infrastructure, and
    targets information or data that the company values most and that it has attempted
    to secure. When you exploit one system after another, you are trying to demonstrate
    attacks that would have the greatest business impact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When attacking systems in post exploitation, you should take the time to determine
    what the various systems do and their different user roles. For example, suppose
    you compromise a domain infrastructure system and you’re running as an enterprise
    administrator or have domain administrative-level rights. You might be king of
    the domain, but what about the systems that communicate with Active Directory?
    What about the main financial application that is used to pay employees? Could
    you compromise that system, and then, on the next pay cycle, have it route all
    the money out of the company to an offshore account? How about the target’s intellectual
    property?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Post exploitation is one of those tricky scenarios in which you must take the
    time to learn what information is available to you and then use that information
    to your benefit. An attacker would generally spend a significant amount of time
    in a compromised system doing the same. Think like a malicious attacker — be creative,
    adapt quickly, and rely on your wits instead of automated tools.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When performing a penetration test, you’re working from an attacker’s point
    of view, something that organizations rarely see. The information you obtain during
    a test is vital to the success of the organization’s information security program
    and in stopping future attacks. As you compile and report your findings, think
    about how the organization can use your findings to raise awareness, remediate
    the issues discovered, and improve overall security rather than just patch the
    technical vulnerabilities.
  prefs: []

- en: At a minimum, divide your report into an executive summary, executive presentation,
    and technical findings. The technical findings will be used by the client to remediate
    security holes, but this is also where the value lies in a penetration test. For
    example, if you find a SQL injection vulnerability in the client’s web-based applications,
    you might recommend that your client sanitize all user input, leverage parameterized
    SQL queries, run SQL as a limited user account, and turn on custom error messages.
  prefs: []

    SQL injection vulnerability, are they really protected from SQL injection? No.
    An underlying problem likely caused the SQL injection vulnerability in the first
    place, such as a failure to ensure that third-party applications are secure. Those
    will need to be fixed as well.

    examine the two main types of penetration tests: *overt* and *covert*. An overt
    pen test, or “white hat” test, occurs with the organization’s full knowledge;
    covert tests are designed to simulate the actions of an unknown and unannounced
    attacker. Both tests offer advantages and disadvantages.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using overt penetration testing, you work with the organization to identify
    potential security threats, and the organization’s IT or security team shows you
    the organization’s systems. The one main benefit of an overt test is that you
    have access to insider knowledge and can launch attacks without fear of being
    blocked. A potential downside to overt testing is that overt tests might not effectively
    test the client’s incident response program or identify how well the security
    program detects certain attacks. When time is limited and certain PTES steps such
    as intelligence gathering are out of scope, an overt test may be your best option.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike overt testing, sanctioned covert penetration testing is designed to simulate
    the actions of an attacker and is performed without the knowledge of most of the
    organization. Covert tests are performed to test the internal security team’s
    ability to detect and respond to an attack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Covert tests can be costly and time consuming, and they require more skill than
    overt tests. In the eyes of penetration testers in the security industry, the
    covert scenario is often preferred because it most closely simulates a true attack.
    Covert attacks rely on your ability to gain information by reconnaissance. Therefore,
    as a covert tester, you will typically not attempt to find a large number of vulnerabilities
    in a target but will simply attempt to find the easiest way to gain access to
    a system, undetected.

- en: Vulnerability scanners are automated tools used to identify security flaws affecting
    a given system or application. Vulnerability scanners typically work by *fingerprinting*
    a target’s operating system (that is, identifying the version and type) as well
    as any services that are running. Once you have fingerprinted the target’s operating
    system, you use the vulnerability scanner to execute specific checks to determine
    whether vulnerabilities exist. Of course, these checks are only as good as their
    creators, and, as with any fully automated solution, they can sometimes miss or
    misrepresent vulnerabilities on a system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most modern vulnerability scanners do an amazing job of minimizing false positives,
    and many organizations use them to identify out-of-date systems or potential new
    exposures that might be exploited by attackers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vulnerability scanners play a very important role in penetration testing, especially
    in the case of overt testing, which allows you to launch multiple attacks without
    having to worry about avoiding detection. The wealth of knowledge gleaned from
    vulnerability scanners can be invaluable, but beware of relying on them too heavily.
    The beauty of a penetration test is that it can’t be automated, and attacking
    systems successfully requires that you have knowledge and skills. In most cases,
    when you become a skilled penetration tester, you will rarely use a vulnerability
    scanner but will rely on your knowledge and expertise to compromise a system.

    tester, you need to ensure that your intelligence gathering and vulnerability
    analysis are as expert as possible, to give you an advantage in adapting to scenarios
    as they present themselves.
