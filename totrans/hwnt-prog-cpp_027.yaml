    They were having a rather annoying problem. At night, when the operator left the
    room, the computer would reboot.

    system rebooted only when the operator went to the bathroom. When he went out
    for a drink of water, nothing happened.

    was connected to the water pipes. The operator weighed about 300 pounds, and when
    he sat on the toilet, he bent it forward a few inches, just enough to separate
    the pipes. This broke the connection to the ground, causing a glitch that rebooted
    the computer.
