- en: Apple's AirPort family of wireless networking products is the logical choice
    for Macintosh users who want to create a wireless network to connect their computers
    and for those who want to connect their Macs to an existing wireless network.
    Because Apple controls both ends of the network link—the access point and the
    network client—an AirPort network is a lot easier to set up than a generic Wi-Fi
    network. The AirPort Extreme (Apple's name for its access point) automatically
    loads its Internet configuration settings from an existing Macintosh connection
    and transfers those settings to all the other computers on the same network.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple is a member of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA), and
    both the AirPort Extreme and the AirPort Extreme Card carry Wi-Fi certification.
    Therefore, a Macintosh with an AirPort card can join any Wi-Fi network almost
    as easily as it can join an AirPort network. A mixed-platform wireless network
    that includes Macs, Windows-based PCs, and Unix or Linux machines can use one
    or more AirPort Extremes as access points.

    networks, but the general rules for designing, configuring, and using an AirPort
    network are the same as the rules for setting up generic wireless networks. The
    only difference between an AirPort network and any other Wi-Fi network is some
    of the terminology and the software that moves configuration data from a network
    client to the base station.

    their computers through an AirPort Extreme to other Macs. But that's not the only
    possible way to use a wireless network with a Macintosh. Because the Setup Assistant
    automates the process, it's easier to connect Macs to an AirPort Extreme network
    than it is to build a mixed-platform wireless network that can use access points,
    network adapters, and configuration software from different sources. AirPort Extreme
    Cards do meet the Wi-Fi specification for interoperability, so they can also communicate
    with Wi-Fi access points made by many other manufacturers (and in ad hoc networks
    with other Wi-Fi adapters). Therefore, it is not a problem to use a Macintosh
    computer in a new or existing wireless network that also includes network clients
