- en: I’ve been writing about Linux and GIMP in particular since 1996\. I’ve written
    for every kind of publication, ranging from countless print articles and magazine
    columns to website musings and multiple books. In 2001, I wrote about how Linux
    and GIMP were starting to make waves in the special-effects industry with the
    article “Linux Goes to the Movies” in *Salon.com*. Open source has come a long
    way since then. And so has GIMP.

- en: When GIMP was first started as a class project at the University of California,
    Berkeley, it was built on top of the venerable Motif toolkit, which at the time
    was really the only full-featured software library for X11-based windowing systems.
    Version 0.54 was my first taste of the GIMP in this form. Later, the GIMP Toolkit
    (GTK+) was born, and it replaced Motif for various technical reasons. Somewhere
    between version 0.54 and version 0.99, I ported John Beale’s Sparkle code to a
    GIMP plug-in. For that ancient yet still meaningful work, I’m listed as a contributor
    to the project. It even got me into the Red Hat “friends and family” plan when
    they had their IPO (I should’ve sold when it was at its peak—silly me). Eventually,
    my association with the project led me to write for the *Linux Gazette* and later
    *Linux Journal*, the latter of which led to my first book on GIMP, in fact *the*
    first book on GIMP, called *The Artists’ Guide to the GIMP*. You might say I’ve
    followed Linux and GIMP from day one.

    subject, and GIMP is no longer just a class project. Plenty of texts exist that
    show you which button opens which dialog. In the first edition of this book, I
    hoped to go where no one else had attempted, beyond the application itself and
    into what it can do. In this second edition, I’m updating the old tutorials, tossing
    in some new ones, and giving you a look at how GIMP is evolving.

    the computing world. Linux comes with a serious desktop, and GIMP is a serious
    application. It’s time to get down to business: the business of graphic design.
    This book is about learning techniques applicable to the real world.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is about process, not buttons or menu paths. My goal is to show you
    that the processes required to perform a task can be done with GIMP as easily
    as with any other graphics editor. It isn’t the tool that’s important, it’s understanding
    the process. It’s far easier to grasp that a mask is a black region blocking out
    a section of an image than it is to find a use for an alpha channel and a black
    background. Don’t get bogged down in the mechanics of the tool. Focus on the task
    at hand. I’ll point you to the GIMP components necessary to finish the job. By
    the time you’re done with these tutorials, you won’t need any more pointing.

    menu, available from the Windows menu. Clicking a menu entry jumps to that dialog
    quickly if it’s already open or opens it if necessary.

- en: This book was written during the development of GIMP 2.8, so it’s most relevant
    to that particular version of GIMP. But I’ve tried to keep my advice general enough
    that the book remains useful even as newer versions of GIMP are released.

- en: In this book, you won’t find manual pages for each filter, menu, or feature.
    I won’t be explaining each icon you find or why some dialogs look like they do.
    Instead, the tutorials presented here show how to use filters as if they were
    a set of tools in a toolbox. You seldom need just a hammer for a project. GIMP
    provides the hammer, the saw, the drill, even the kitchen sink. With this book,
    I hope you’ll learn to use all the tools in the toolbox.

- en: 'The book has six chapters, each consisting of multiple tutorials. Each chapter
    covers a different area of graphic design: Fundamental Techniques, Photographic
    Effects, Web Design, Advertising and Special Effects, Type Effects, and Creative
    Inspiration (advanced projects). Each tutorial opens with introductory material
    on the subject at hand and includes a set of tips related to that area of design.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Fundamental Techniques") provides a set of
    core tips laid out in an introductory fashion, from the toolbox to common tasks
    like drawing and text manipulation. Users new to GIMP should read this chapter
    thoroughly, while more advanced users may glance through it or skip it altogether.
    Each tutorial after [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Fundamental Techniques")
    is an independent project, so try to find a project that strikes your fancy. These
    tutorials can be completed in any order.'

    GIMP’s raster processing is ideal for working with photographs and stock imagery.
    The number of effects you can create is limitless, but this chapter will help
    you get started with some often-used photographic techniques.'

    for the Web. In many areas of the Web, static images still play key roles. Features
    like background images, menus and buttons, and logos are all part and parcel of
    everyday GIMP work.'

    to cell phones to underwater adventures.'

    Select All (CTRL-A) or Deselect All (CTRL-SHIFT-A)—because GIMP allows you to
    customize the shortcuts any way you like. Instead, I’ll reference the default
    menu locations where necessary. If the feature has a keyboard shortcut, it’ll
    be listed next to that option in the menu. Learn those to speed your work through
    these tutorials.

    letters to make the key sequence easier to read. Unless SHIFT is specifically
    listed with the keystroke, the SHIFT key need not be used.

- en: 'Unless otherwise noted, assume a default canvas size of 640 × 400 pixels to
    make the tutorials easier to produce on slower systems. This size works fine on
    the Web, but you’ll need to scale up the process if you intend to use a technique
    for a print project: increase the amount of blur, adjust the number of pixels
    to offset a layer, and so forth. The thing to remember in each tutorial is the
    basic set of steps: add text, blur, offset a layer, duplicate and rotate, and
    so on. The amount of each of these varies with the scale of the project, and print
    projects tend to use significantly larger canvases than the default 640 × 400
    pixel, 72 dpi canvas used in these tutorials.'
  prefs: []

- en: Be sure *not* to create the project at the default canvas size and then try
    to scale it up at the end! Doing so produces grainy, unsuitable results.

- en: In this book, the terms *canvas* and *image window* are interchangeable. The
    official GIMP documentation refers to the main drawing area as an image window.
    I like to use *canvas* because the term *image* is somewhat overused—it can mean
    more than one thing, depending on context. Besides, artists work on a canvas.
    They produce images. It just makes sense to me.
