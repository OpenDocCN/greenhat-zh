- en: Before entering the world of Linux, I had used just about every desktop operating
    system around. Despite the differences among them all, however, one thing that
    I eventually suffered from in each case was a kind of visual boredom. I suppose
    you might call it GUI fatigue. It wasn’t that I was tired of using a graphical
    interface; it was just that I couldn’t help but get sick of looking at the same
    old icons, window borders, and color schemes. Of course, there were some changes
    that could be made, but it just wasn’t possible to get around the basic look and
    feel without add-ons that demanded a price in terms of performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the features of Linux that pleased me to no end, and continues to do
    so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don’t mean just
    the icons and backgrounds, but everything, including the actual window borders
    and controls. Add to that the variety of GUIs available for Linux that can be
    milked for all their graphical worth, and you have a totally customizable system.
    Is it any wonder that there are so many more Linux desktop screenshots out there
    on the Web than for any other system?
  prefs: []

    but you can learn to use and enjoy all the graphical customization power that
    Linux offers you as you work through this chapter.

    We are going to start off easy by just creating folders, but by the time we get
    to the end of the process, you will have created a much wilder, and, depending
    on how you look at things, gaudier desktop environment than you’ve ever seen before.
    All of this is in good fun, of course, and when you are done, you should be able
    to completely and confidently customize things the way you want on your own. So

    you created in [Chapter 3](DDU0024_split_000.html#81). Once you have done that,
    you will see that there is nothing at all inside the Home folder except for a
    folder called Desktop, which basically contains any files, folders, and shortcuts
    to programs that you have put on your desktop. If you are anything like me, you
    will want to put an end to this rather empty state of affairs by creating some
    folders in which you can organize your files in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first folder you will create will be for your writings, which you’ll call
    “Documentia,” though you can, of course, change the name later if you like. You
    can create a folder quite easily, much in the way you do in Windows, by either
    clicking on the **File** menu and then selecting **Create Folder**, or by right-clicking
    in an empty space within the Nautilus window and then selecting **Create Folder**
    from the pop-up menu. An untitled folder will appear in the window.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a folder titled “untitled” is, of course, a tad goofy, so you will want
    to change that. The text in the box below the folder will already be highlighted,
    so just type Documentia and press ENTER. Once you have done that, the folder will
    show its new name.

    will use in customizing the look of your system), and **ogg** (the default directory
    for music files you rip from music CDs with the program Grip). Once you have done
    all this, your Home folder window should look like that in [Figure 5-3](#figure.DDU51).'

    just the beginning. To graphically remind yourself what each folder is for, you
    can add little folder-top icons called *emblems*. These can be added to any folder
    or file. For now, let’s add one to the Documentia folder by right-clicking it,
    and then, in the pop-up menu, selecting **Properties**. When the Properties window
    shown in [Figure 5-4](#figure.DDU52) opens, click the **Emblems** tab and then
    scroll down until you see the emblem called **documents**. Click the checkbox
    next to **documents** and then click the **Close** button. The emblem should now
    appear on your folder.

    go to the menu bar of your Home window, click the **Edit** menu, and select **Backgrounds

    for all your Nautilus windows. So, for experience’s sake, scroll down to find
    the pattern swatch called **Manila Paper**, and then drag it to the white space
    of your Home window. Once you’re done, the previously white window area will look
    like the wallpaper in a lawyer’s office. Very nice, if you like that sort of thing.
    You can change it to a different background in the same way, of course, or you
    can go back to the default white by dragging the **Reset** swatch into the window.

    and selecting **Properties** in the pop-up menu. The **Emblems** button provides
    another way to do the same thing, but this method is far handier when adding emblems
    to several folders or files in the same go.

    so. Then drag the emblem named **Camera** onto your Photos folder, **Cool** onto
    your Thematics folder, and **package** onto your Tarballs_and_RPMs folder. The
    selected emblems will then immediately appear on those folders. (And in case you
    are wondering why some of the names of these emblems are capitalized and some
    are not, I have no idea. Sorry.)

    of color. Drag the **Grapefruit** swatch to your side pane, and it will turn from
    gray to, of all things, grapefruit (albeit a very dark and unusually colored grapefruit).
    You can also create a two-color-gradation effect by adding yet another color.
    Drag the **Mango** swatch to the bottom of the side pane (but still within the
    pane) and you should have a grapefruit-to-mango, top-to-bottom gradation within
    the pane. Of course, if you are not pleased with this tropical color set, you
    can get back to your original default gray panel by dragging the **Reset** swatch
    onto the area. When you’re done, you can close the Backgrounds and Emblems window.
  prefs: []

- en: The side panel of your Nautilus window provides yet a third way to work with
    emblems. But before I let you in on this third, and last, way, you will need to
    add two more folders to your Home folder. Create one folder and name it “Finances,”
    which you can use to store files dealing with your relative worth in the modern
    scheme of things, and then create another and call it “MyFaves,” where you can
    place . . . well, your favorite files.

    emblem named **Money**, and drag it onto your **Finances** folder. Next, find
    the **favorite** emblem and drag it onto your **MyFaves** folder. Once you are
    done, go back to the drop-down menu and select **Information** to get everything
    back to relative normalcy again.

    the filename, once you find it, and then, from the information and download page,
    download it to your Thematics folder by right-clicking the filename, **MCity-Metativo.tar.gz**,
    and selecting **Save Link Target As** in the pop-up menu.

    Mac-like in flavor, look pretty cool. Anyway, to download them, just click the
    **Icon** link under the **Desktop Themes** heading, and then click the link **Tux
    n Tosh 0.2** in the new window. Once you arrive at the information and download
    page for that file, download it to your Thematics folder by right-clicking the
    link for that file, **ICON-Tux-n-Tosh-0.1.tar.bz2**, and selecting **Save Link

    open your **Thematics** folder in Nautilus, and then drag the window to the right
    side of your screen so that it is readily accessible. Then, open your Theme Preferences
    window, if it isn’t still open, and click the **Theme Details** button, and, in

    file from your Thematics folder window and drop it into the list of borders on

    like that in [Figure 5-13](#figure.DDU61) on the next page will then open. Just
    click the **Install** button in that window, and the theme will then be added
    to the list of borders as **MetaTivo**. Once you see it in the list, you can click
    on it and the theme will immediately take effect.

    a *greeter* — the screen where you type in your username and user password when
    you first log in to your system. The Login Manager is another thing that you can
    customize, but you have to have root privileges in order to do so. In addition,
    any changes you make will be system-wide, not just for you, so whatever Login
    Manager theme you install and choose will be the Login Manager theme that everyone
    else using your computer will see when they use the machine. Of course, if you

    users so as to prevent damage (burn-in) to your monitor. Video display technology,
    however, has now advanced to the point that screensavers are no longer necessary.
    Nevertheless, screensavers are cool to look at, and one very nice thing about
    Fedora is that it comes with an unusually extensive collection of screensaver
    modules — nearly 200 of them! There are so many that you are sure to find at least
    a few you like. The screensaver settings are preconfigured to switch between modules
    randomly, changing the current module every few minutes. You can change these
    settings by going to your Main menu and selecting **Preferences** > **Screensaver**.

    to use only one screensaver module or no screensaver at all. In random mode, you
    can also omit the modules that you don’t like by unchecking the boxes next to
    the undesired modules’ names.
