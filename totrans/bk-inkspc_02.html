These are your first baby steps in the new world. If you have already worked with Inkscape and think you can easily recreate this chapter’s final example (<a class="xref" href="ch02s10.html#life_and_its_many_faces" title="Figure 2-24. Life and its many faces">Figure 2-24</a>) on your own, feel free to skip this chapter.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.1 Installing Inkscape"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot1_installing_inkscape"/>2.1 Installing Inkscape</h1></div></div></div><p>The first question to ask yourself before installing Inkscape is whether you want a <span class="emphasis"><em>stable version</em></span> or a <span class="emphasis"><em>development build</em></span>. Stable versions have been officially released and have version numbers associated with them. Calling a version (for example, version 0.46.1) stable does not mean it’s perfect and never crashes; it just means this version has received a decent amount of testing, is more completely documented, and is what most people use. In fact, apart from its stability, the biggest advantage of running a stable version is that this is what other users run, so fellow Inkscape artists are more likely to be able to help you.</p><p>Overall, I recommend that you start with a stable version, but consider upgrading to a development build if you find that you like Inkscape and want to support its development, or if you need the new features added since the <a id="iddle1086" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1207" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2567" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2612" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2618" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2683" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2805" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4933" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4936" class="indexterm"/>release (visit the next version’s Release Notes on <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.inkscape.org">http://wiki.inkscape.org</a></em></span> to see what’s being worked on).</p><p>Using a <span class="emphasis"><em>development build</em></span> has its own distinct advantages. First of all, such builds have all the latest and best features, which are often quite significant compared to the latest stable version (especially if it’s been several months since the stable release). These new features often include fixes for the important bugs of the stable version. Also, by running the development version, you help the development community to discover and iron out new bugs. Naturally, active developers are more interested in the development version, so you’re more likely to receive prompt help directly from the developers.</p><p>But what about stability? Granted, development builds are, on average, buggier and crash more often. However, if you run into a bug that’s really driving you crazy—and if that bug is not fixed quickly enough—you can always go back to the latest stable version. (Remember to save often, no matter which version you use!)</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Inkscape’s stable releases are still numbered below 1.0, and each release increments the version number by just 0.01 (for example, 0.40 was followed by 0.41, then 0.42, and so on). Recently, several months typically pass between stable releases. Often, a 0.</em></span> xx <span class="emphasis"><em>stable release is followed by a 0.</em></span> xx. <span class="emphasis"><em>1 bugfix release (for example, 0.45 was followed within a month by 0.45.1), which adds no new features but fixes some bugs. Development builds after the 0.</em></span> xx <span class="emphasis"><em>release are designated 0.</em></span> xx<span class="emphasis"><em>+svn (for example, 0.46+svn), and each build has a revision number (for example, r20887). You can always find out the exact version number, revision, and build date of your installation of Inkscape by opening <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span></em></span> ▸ <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>About</strong></span> (look at the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>About</strong></span> window) or by running Inkscape from the command line with the</em></span> <code class="literal">--version</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>parameter (not on Windows, <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. The Command Line">Appendix C</a>).</em></span></p></div><p>Fortunately, the stable and development versions are equally easy to install. Just go to the Download section of the Inkscape website (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.inkscape.org">http://www.inkscape.org</a></em></span>) and follow the links to either a stable or a development version for your operating system.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You will download a <span class="emphasis"><em>.exe</em></span> installer. Just run it and follow the prompts to choose the language, directory, and other options. At the end you will get a clickable icon of Inkscape on your desktop and in the Start menu.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02note02"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Sometimes, development versions for Windows are archive files with the extension</em></span> .7z<span class="emphasis"><em>.

If all you want is a stable version, most Linux distributions already include one; just select it in your software installation application (for example, on Ubuntu, launch Synaptic or simply run <code class="literal">apt-get install inkscape</code> from the command line).</p><p>This version, however, is often quite old. If you want a newer stable version or the development bleeding edge version, download an autopackage for the version of choice. After you get the <span class="emphasis"><em>.package</em></span> file, make it executable and run it. (The first time you do this, you will be prompted to download <a id="iddle1436" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2492" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2558" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2574" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2609" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2818" class="indexterm"/>and install the Autopackage program itself; everything is done automatically once you allow it.) Follow the prompts. Once the package is installed, you will get Inkscape in your <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> menu and/or on the desktop (it will also be, of course, runnable from the terminal by typing <code class="literal">inkscape</code>).</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You will download a disk image (<span class="emphasis"><em>.dmg</em></span>) file; just open it in the Finder and drag the contents somewhere on your system. Note that you need to install X11 from Apple’s OS X installation disc for Inkscape to work.</p></li></ul></div><p>New development versions are made available fairly regularly, normally every day. If, however, you want absolutely up-to-the-minute Inkscape, or if the above methods do not work for you for some reason, you can get Inkscape’s code directly from the SVN repository and compile it yourself. Compiling Inkscape is possible on all major platforms; however, it requires an above average level of computer savviness, so we won’t discuss it here.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.2 Inkscape&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hello, World!&#x201D;"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot2_inkscapeapostrophes_quotation_ma"/>2.2 Inkscape’s “Hello, World!”</h1></div></div></div><p>Studying a new programming language traditionally starts with a “Hello, world!” example. This is a minimal, yet real and working, program that simply outputs the string “Hello, world!” somewhere and then quits. Let’s go through a minimal yet real Inkscape editing session which includes starting the program, creating some objects, editing them, and saving the result.</p><p>Starting Inkscape is no different from starting any other program. Depending on your OS and personal preferences, you can click the icon, select it from a menu, or type <code class="literal">inkscape</code> on the command line. Whatever you use, you will end up with a default Inkscape interface:</p><div class="figure"><a id="first_look_at_inkscape"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00003"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735310.png.jpg" alt="The first look at Inkscape"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-1. The first look at Inkscape</p></div><p>Inkscape’s window displays a white work area, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>canvas</em></span>, in the middle and a number of tools and controls at the edges. The canvas is what interests us <a id="iddle3641" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4662" class="indexterm"/>now. It represents a new, empty, document Inkscape has created for us, so you don’t need to select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>. We can start working on it right away.</p><p>In the column of icons on the left, click the icon with the blue square. This is the Rectangle tool that lets you create and edit rectangles. Now, click the mouse button anywhere on the canvas and drag. A blue rectangle will appear; when you release the mouse, the rectangle will be created as a new <span class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span> in your document:</p><div class="figure"><a id="we_have_created_a_rectangle"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00004"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735312.png.jpg" alt="We have created a rectangle."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-2. We have created a rectangle.</p></div><p>Now, click the <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> button on the left, which will switch you to the Text tool. Click (but do not drag) inside the rectangle. You will see a text cursor blinking where you clicked. Type <code class="literal">Hello, world!</code>. You have just created a text object, the second object in your document:</p><div class="figure"><a id="we_have_added_some_text"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00005"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735314.png.jpg" alt="We have added some text."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-3. We have added some text.</p></div><p><a id="iddle1596" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1869" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1903" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2266" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2575" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2621" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2893" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2907" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3207" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3234" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3793" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3876" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4074" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4514" class="indexterm"/>Now, you probably have a better idea as for the size, position, or color of your objects. Easy fix! In the toolbar on the left, click the topmost button showing an arrow. This is the Selector tool. Now you can move any of the objects anywhere on the canvas by dragging with the mouse. To change the color of an object, simply drag that color from the color palette at the bottom of the window and drop it on the object.</p><p>Enough tweaking. The document looks perfect. The only problem with it is that it’s not saved to a file yet. Just select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>, navigate to the directory of your choice, and type a filename. That’s all: You have just created a new SVG document with graphics and text. Congratulations!</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.3 Interface Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot3_interface_overview"/>2.3 Interface Overview</h1></div></div></div><p>Now, let’s take a closer look at the interface of Inkscape:</p><div class="figure"><a id="elements_of_the_inkscape_interface"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00006"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735316.png.jpg" alt="Elements of the Inkscape interface"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-4. Elements of the Inkscape interface</p></div><p>Of course you don’t have to work in the small window that Inkscape starts with by default. Feel free to maximize it to fill the whole screen. You can even press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00002"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735318.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to enter fullscreen mode.</p><p>Most of the window is occupied by the <span class="emphasis"><em>canvas</em></span>, surrounded by rulers (top and left) and scrollbars (bottom and right). On the canvas, you can see a rectangular shade of a page (A4 paper size by default). This <span class="emphasis"><em>page frame</em></span> defines the edges of your document. However, Inkscape allows you to freely draw anywhere, both on and off the page: The page frame is not a restriction, just a hint. This frame only matters when exporting into some vector formats and when viewing the SVG file in an external viewer; in both these cases you will see only the objects that overlap the page rectangle. You can easily hide the page frame if you don’t care about it.</p><p><a id="iddle1586" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1658" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1675" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1790" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1816" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3229" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3886" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4312" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4316" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4699" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4700" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4994" class="indexterm"/>The part of the canvas you see is far from all the canvas there is. In fact, the canvas is so huge, it is almost infinite. You can see more of it by zooming out or by scrolling in any direction, as we’ll see in the next section. You’ll never run out of room in Inkscape! (In fact, you can even get lost in the vastness of canvas; to return to the page frame, just press the <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00003"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735320.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> key at any time.)</p><p>To the left of the canvas, there’s the vertical <span class="emphasis"><em>main toolbox</em></span>. The buttons on this toolbox activate various Inkscape tools. Each tool has its own purpose, features, controls, keyboard shortcuts, mouse cursors, and other stuff. Some tools create new objects, others edit them in various ways, and still others help you navigate in your document. We’ll briefly look at some of the tools in this chapter and explore them all in detail in the rest of the book.</p><p>Above the canvas you see two more toolbars, both horizontal. Of these, the top one, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>commands bar</em></span>, is a regular toolbar of the type you’ll find in many programs. It has buttons for actions such as <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span>, and so on. The other toolbar, immediately above the canvas, is more interesting: It is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>tool controls bar</em></span> (or simply the <span class="emphasis"><em>controls bar</em></span>) and contains various options and controls applicable to the currently selected tool. Click some tool buttons on the left and watch the contents of the controls bar change.</p><p>Below the canvas, there’s the <span class="emphasis"><em>color palette</em></span>; it can be scrolled horizontally by a scrollbar of its own. Further below, there’s the <span class="emphasis"><em>status bar</em></span>, a motley bag of stuff whose components we will explore in detail later. For now, take note of the <span class="emphasis"><em>message area</em></span> of the status bar, which always displays some message relevant to what you’re doing now. Pay attention to what the message area is saying; it may save you a lot of time and frustration!</p><p>Finally, to the right of the canvas, there’s the <span class="emphasis"><em>dock</em></span> for Inkscape’s dialogs. By default the dock is hidden, but if you call up a dialog (for example, the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00004"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735322.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), it will appear in the automatically expanded dock:</p><div class="figure"><a id="several_docked_dialogs_left_parenthesisa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00007"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735324.png.jpg" alt="Several docked dialogs (and one floating)"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-5. Several docked dialogs (and one floating)</p></div><p><a id="iddle1448" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1819" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3092" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3240" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3244" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3878" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3887" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4130" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4982" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4986" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5008" class="indexterm"/>The dock may contain many different dialogs; if there are too many of them to fit vertically, the dock gets a scrollbar. Each dialog in the dock can be minimized (the button with the triangle) or closed (the button with the X). You can drag dialogs around in the dock to rearrange them. You can also drag a dialog off the dock, in which case it becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>floating</em></span> and can be placed anywhere on your screen. In most cases, however, working with docked dialogs is more convenient.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02note03"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>As of version 0.47, not all Inkscape dialogs can be docked (see <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s07.html" title="3.7 Dialogs">3.7 Dialogs</a></strong></span> for more on that).</em></span></p></div><p>All elements of the interface except the menu, the canvas, and the dock can be shown or hidden using commands in the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Show/Hide</strong></span> submenu.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.4 Panning and Zooming"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot4_panning_and_zooming"/>2.4 Panning and Zooming</h1></div></div></div><p>With an infinite vector canvas, the ability to move around that canvas as well as to zoom in and out for a more convenient view is very important. Inkscape offers a plethora of ways to pan (scroll) and zoom, enough to satisfy every taste.</p><p>Of course, the canvas scrollbars work just fine to scroll the canvas wherever you want to go. However, these scrollbars aren’t all that convenient, so I usually hide them by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00005"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735326.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. Instead, what I use most often is <span class="emphasis"><em>middle-drag</em></span>: Press the middle mouse button on any point of the canvas and drag it in any direction. Middle-drag works in any tool or mode.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02note04"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you think your mouse does not have a middle button, try to press (not roll) the wheel that most mice have in between the left and right buttons. In most cases, this wheel can be clicked just as if it were a button. Of course, rotating the wheel also works to scroll the canvas vertically, whereas rotating it with</em></span> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00006"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>scrolls horizontally.</em></span></p></div><p>Very often, however, my right hand is on the keyboard instead of the mouse. In that case, the most convenient way to scroll the canvas is by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00007"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735330.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. If you press and hold <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00008"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735332.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, for example, the canvas starts scrolling downwards (i.e., your view starts going up), at first slowly but gradually accelerating. When you get the hang of it, it feels very natural.</p><p>Zooming in and out is also easy. With your keyboard, just press the plus <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00009"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735334.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or minus <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00010"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735336.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> keys to zoom in or out (note that unlike most other programs, these are just plain plus and minus keys, either on the main keyboard or on the keypad; you don’t need to press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00011"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00012"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> with either.) With your mouse, middle click to zoom in and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00013"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-middle click to zoom out. Or, switch to the Zoom tool where you can use regular left click to zoom in, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00014"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-left click to zoom out, or drag with the left mouse button to zoom into a rectangular area.</p><p>For lots more zooming and panning information and tips, jump to <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03s08.html" title="3.8 Basic Zooming">3.8 Basic Zooming</a></strong></span>.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.5 Creating Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot5_creating_objects"/>2.5 Creating Objects</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that you can navigate your way around the canvas, let’s have a closer look at the tools available for creating objects.</p><p><a id="iddle1024" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1972" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3450" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3487" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3642" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4110" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4119" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4121" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4214" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4271" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4701" class="indexterm"/>Looking down the main toolbox, the first object-creating tool you see is the Rectangle tool. This and the next four tools—3D Box, Ellipse, Star, and Spiral—are collectively called <span class="emphasis"><em>shape tools</em></span>, and the objects they create are called <span class="emphasis"><em>shapes</em></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="playing_with_shape_tools"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00008"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735340.png.jpg" alt="Playing with shape tools"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-6. Playing with shape tools</p></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>shape</em></span> is a geometric object which you can not only move, scale, or rotate (as you can any other object) but also edit in some ways specific to its type. For example, a rectangle can have rounded corners; an ellipse can be turned into a segment (pie-slice shape) or elliptic arc; a 3D box can be moved and resized in its own 3D space. We will talk about shapes in <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Shapes">Chapter 11</a>; for now, choose any of the shape tools and start drawing on the canvas. Each mouse drag, from press to release of the left mouse button, creates a new shape.</p><p>Next down in the toolbox are the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pencil</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Pen</em></span> tools. Both create arbitrary paths, but do so differently. The Pencil tool works just like a real pencil: You draw on the canvas, and it leaves behind a trace. (Note that the trace is not exact; it’s a bit smoothed out compared to the actual mouse trajectory.)</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_the_pencil_and_pen_tools"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00009"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735342.png.jpg" alt="Using the Pencil and Pen tools"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-7. Using the Pencil and Pen tools</p></div><p><a id="iddle1191" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1383" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1434" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1453" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2133" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2228" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2240" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3214" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3225" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3484" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3508" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3905" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4336" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4374" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4602" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4608" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4612" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4663" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4688" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4776" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4930" class="indexterm"/>The Pen tool is more complex; it assumes that you understand how paths are composed of nodes connected by linear or curved segments. For now, just click several times with this tool at different points (this creates linear segments between click points), then click and drag a few times, and finally press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00015"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735344.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to finish the path. Both Pencil and Pen by default create paths with thin black stroke but no fill. We’ll discuss these tools in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Drawing">Chapter 14</a>.</p><p>The next two tools, <span class="emphasis"><em>Calligraphic pen</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Paint bucket</em></span>, also create paths, but unlike Pencil and Pen, they by default produce filled paths without stroke. The Calligraphic pen is one of the most versatile tools in Inkscape; its many options and parameters allow it to imitate not only calligraphic pen (which was its original purpose), but also various brushes and many other drawing implements and behaviors (some of which have no counterpart in the real world). This is the primary tool of those who use Inkscape to <span class="emphasis"><em>simply draw</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Drawing">Chapter 14</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_the_calligraphic_pen_and_paint_buc"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00010"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735346.png.jpg" alt="Using the Calligraphic pen and Paint bucket tools"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-8. Using the Calligraphic pen and Paint bucket tools</p></div><p>The Paint bucket tool is also a great help for a cartoonist or illustrator. Just as you’d expect, it fills in any bounded area, creating a filled vector path. For practice, draw around a closed area with several brush strokes of the Calligraphic pen, then click inside with the Paint bucket. (If you click in an unbounded area, the tool will fail to fill it and say so in the status bar.)</p><p>Finally, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Text</em></span> tool creates and edits text objects. Creating a new text object is as simple as clicking anywhere and starting to type. Or, you can click and drag, in which case you’re creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>flowed text</em></span> object that will automatically wrap when you type up to the right edge. Editing an existing text object is just as easy: Click it with the Text tool to position the cursor and use all the familiar text editing keys (the arrow keys, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00016"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735348.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00017"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735350.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00018"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735352.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, and so on).

That frame indicates that the object is <span class="emphasis"><em>selected</em></span>.</p><p>Selection is a fundamental concept in Inkscape. Almost all tools, commands, dialogs, and shortcuts work only on those objects that are currently selected. Various informational displays, such as the status bar, always describe the selected objects. The ability to quickly and precisely select what you need, as well as to quickly figure out what is currently selected and where, is absolutely vital for effective work in Inkscape.</p><p>The main tool that allows you to select objects is called, appropriately enough, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Selector</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch02s06.html#selector_tool_and_a_selected_object" title="Figure 2-10. The Selector tool and a selected object">Figure 2-10</a>). It is also the first (topmost) tool on the toolbox, because selecting is so important. You can switch to this tool not only by clicking its button but also by pressing either <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00019"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735356.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00020"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735358.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00021"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735308.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>.

Usually, when you already have something selected, clicking another object deselects the first. However, if you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00022"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click any unselected object, you <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> it to the list of selected objects. (If you <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00023"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click an already selected object, you will <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> it from selection.)

<div class="sect1" title="2.7 Transforming"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot7_transforming"/>2.7 Transforming</h1></div></div></div><p>The other function of the Selector tool, apart from selecting objects, is <span class="emphasis"><em>transforming</em></span> them.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch02s07.html" title="2.7 Transforming">2.7 Transforming</a> is simply an umbrella term for <span class="emphasis"><em>moving</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>scaling</em></span> (resizing), <span class="emphasis"><em>rotating</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>skewing</em></span>. The first two of these—and especially moving—are extremely common in vector work because it’s nearly impossible to create objects at once in the exact place and with the exact size you need. You will find yourself moving stuff around all the time, so you need to learn how to do this quickly and precisely.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02note05"/>Note</h3><p><a id="iddle1938" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2894" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2908" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4084" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4088" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>All four transformation modes treat an object</em></span> as a whole<span class="emphasis"><em>. By transforming, you can move, squeeze, rotate, or skew the entire object, but you cannot move one part of the object relative to the other parts; that’s a task for other tools. For example, if the nose in your drawing of a face is a separate object, you can make it larger on the face using nothing but the Selector tool. But if the nose is part of the same object as the rest of the face, you will need to use other tools to make the nose larger without also changing the face.</em></span></p></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Moving</em></span> the selection using the Selector tool is very simple: Just drag any of the selected objects with your mouse. If you have more than one object selected, dragging any one of them moves them all together.</p><p>One very common operation is <span class="emphasis"><em>duplicating</em></span> objects, or making an exact copy of the selection. To do this, press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00030"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>; a copy is created and placed exactly over the original selection (so it does not seemingly change). Just drag it away with the Selector tool to where you want to place the copy. You can also use the traditional copy-and-paste method of duplicating objects (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00031"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735376.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00032"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735378.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>).</p><p>Other types of transforming are a little more difficult. Notice that whenever you have anything selected, the selection is surrounded by eight arrow marks. Dragging any of these arrow marks performs <span class="emphasis"><em>scaling</em></span>: This is how you make your selection larger, smaller, taller, wider, and so on. The four corner arrows can move in any direction, resizing the selected objects freely; the four others move only in one direction (the top center and bottom center marks move vertically, the left center and right center move horizontally).</p><div class="figure"><a id="scaling_objects"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00015"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735380.png.jpg" alt="Scaling objects"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-13. Scaling objects</p></div><p>For the remaining two transformation modes, <span class="emphasis"><em>rotate</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>skew</em></span>, you need to click anywhere on any already selected object, or alternatively press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00033"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735382.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. Notice how the arrow marks change; now your selection is in the <span class="emphasis"><em>rotate mode</em></span>, as opposed to the <span class="emphasis"><em>scale mode</em></span> we used before (<a class="xref" href="ch02s07.html#rotating_and_skewing_objects" title="Figure 2-14. Rotating and skewing objects">Figure 2-14</a>). Now, dragging any of the four corner arrows rotates the selection around its center, while the four other arrows skew the selection. Also, you can still move your selection around by dragging while it’s in the rotate mode. To go back to the scale mode, click the selection or press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00034"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735382.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> again. Next time you select these or other objects, they will again be in the scale mode first.</p><div class="figure"><a id="rotating_and_skewing_objects"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00016"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735384.png.jpg" alt="Rotating and skewing objects"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-14. Rotating and skewing objects</p></div><p><a id="iddle2126" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2887" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3232" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3491" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3741" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3834" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4018" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4417" class="indexterm"/>If you prefer to control Inkscape from the keyboard, you won’t be surprised to learn that the four arrow keys each move the selection in the corresponding direction. More interestingly, the left and right angle brackets (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00035"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735386.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00036"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735388.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) scale the selection down and up, correspondingly, while the square brackets, (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00037"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735390.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00038"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735392.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), rotate it. There are no shortcuts for skewing objects.</p><p>That’s all there is to the basic transformations of objects with the Selector tool. Again, there are many more tricks, shortcuts, and rules of thumb that we’ll discuss later, but for now this should suffice for getting a general feel of how Inkscape works.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="2.8 Styling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="twodot8_styling"/>2.8 Styling</h1></div></div></div><p>Any object in Inkscape has some style. <span class="emphasis"><em>Style</em></span> is a complex thing that includes many separate properties, from the color of the fill to the width of the stroke and to complex SVG filters that totally alter the way the object looks. Let’s look at the basics of changing the style of objects.</p><p>First of all, you should have guessed by now that the style-changing actions, as any other actions in Inkscape, always apply to the <span class="emphasis"><em>current selection</em></span>. That is, before you change the style of something, you must first select that something.</p><p>Once you select the objects you want to style, the simplest thing to do is just click the color palette at the bottom of the canvas. The color you click becomes the new fill color of all selected objects. Even if the object had no fill at all (like a path created with the Pencil tool), it becomes filled with that color too. (Note that you can scroll the palette to the right to see more colors than fit the screen.)</p><div class="figure"><a id="setting_fill_or_stroke_from_the_color_pa"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00017"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735394.png.jpg" alt="Setting fill or stroke from the color palette"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-15. Setting fill or stroke from the color palette</p></div><p><a id="iddle1157" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1502" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1696" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2138" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3079" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3122" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3161" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3267" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3914" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3922" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4000" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4046" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4364" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4381" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4422" class="indexterm"/>You can just as easily change the stroke color of the selected objects: Simply <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00039"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click instead of clicking a color. Again, if some objects have no stroke, they will get it now.</p><p>Now, pay attention to the complex control in the lower-left corner of your Inkscape window, on the left end of the status bar. This control (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch02s08.html#selected_style_indicator" title="Figure 2-16. Selected style indicator">Figure 2-16</a>) is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>selected style indicator</em></span>, and in full accordance with its name, it indicates the style of the selection (actually, it only shows the most important style properties; there’s much more to an object’s style than shown in this indicator). To put it simply, here you can see the fill and stroke colors of the selected objects.</p><div class="figure"><a id="selected_style_indicator"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00018"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735396.png.jpg" alt="Selected style indicator"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-16. Selected style indicator</p></div><p>Perhaps more importantly, here you can also change these style properties. One very common operation is <span class="emphasis"><em>removing</em></span> the fill or stroke from selected objects. Just middle-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill</strong></span> (top) or <span class="strong"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> (bottom) swatch to do this, or right-click the corresponding swatch and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> from the pop-up menu. Note that an object with no fill and no stroke is completely invisible: You can’t see it and you can’t click it to select (although you can drag the rubber band <span class="emphasis"><em>around</em></span> it to select it).</p><p>Apart from the fill and stroke colors, one important style property is <span class="emphasis"><em>opacity</em></span>. Think of stained glass which has its own color but still shows through what is behind it; this is how objects with opacity less than 100% behave in Inkscape. (Obviously, an opacity of 0% makes an object invisible.) Opacity is changed by the <span class="strong"><strong>O:</strong></span> control in the selected style indicator. Try selecting an object which is on top of other objects and type in a different opacity value; notice how the object becomes semitransparent.</p><div class="figure"><a id="changing_opacity"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00019"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735398.png.jpg" alt="Changing opacity"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-17. Changing opacity</p></div><p>If you just want two objects to have the same style, this is easy to do. Select the first object and press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00040"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735376.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>; this places a copy of the object on the clipboard. Then select the other object (or objects) and paste the style of the clipboard object onto them by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00041"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735400.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>.

What is the best way to go about it?</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Saving</em></span> a document as SVG works as expected. Just press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00042"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735402.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or choose <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> from the menu, choose the directory, type the filename, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><p>As far as sharing goes, SVG isn’t a bad format at all; for example, as already mentioned, it can be displayed directly, in all its vector glory, in any modern browser (except the one coded by Microsoft). However, for any number of reasons SVG may not be a viable choice in your situation. In that case, you need to <span class="emphasis"><em>export</em></span> your document to some other format. Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> dialog again. Note the drop-down list in the lower-right corner; now it displays <span class="emphasis"><em>Inkscape SVG</em></span>, but you can see what else is available. Quite a lot, in fact! More than a dozen different vector formats are listed.</p><p>Don’t get overexcited, though. Several of these formats are just variations upon the primary Inkscape SVG format (plain SVG, compressed SVG, etc.). Others are severely limited in various ways, either because the target format is itself limited compared to SVG, or because Inkscape’s exporter for that format is less than fully developed, or both. These export formats are usable, but only if you know what the limitations are and design your documents with these limitations in mind.</p><p>Perhaps the safest export format, besides SVG, is PDF (<a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Import and Export">Appendix B</a>). It still cannot handle some SVG features (such as filters, which are by default rasterized), but for the simple documents you’re going to be creating at this early stage of learning Inkscape, it should be perfectly adequate. The big advantages of PDF are, first, that it is vector, and second, that Adobe Acrobat Reader and other PDF viewers have many more users than any program capable of viewing SVG.</p><p>As you may have noticed, the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> dialog only lists vector formats for export. But what about exporting as a raster image? This is done in a different dialog, called <span class="strong"><strong>Export Bitmap</strong></span>.<sup>[<a id="ch02fn01" href="#ftn.ch02fn01" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> Open it by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00043"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735404.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or choosing <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Export Bitmap</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch18s09.html#export_bitmap_dialog" title="Figure 18-16. The Export Bitmap dialog">Figure 18-16</a>).</p><p>At the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Export Bitmap</strong></span> dialog, there are four buttons for choosing <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> to export.

Otherwise, select <span class="strong"><strong>Drawing</strong></span> to make the export area cover all the objects of your image no matter where they are.

This isn’t much of a challenge, of course, but it should be useful for shaking down all the new knowledge you’ve acquired.</p><p>To start, run a new Inkscape instance, or press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00044"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735406.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to create a new empty document if you’re already running Inkscape.</p><p>Choose the Ellipse tool and draw an ellipse (<a class="xref" href="ch02s10.html#one_ellipse" title="Figure 2-18. One ellipse">Figure 2-18</a>). That will be the boy’s head. Scroll the palette at the bottom, choose a suitable body color, and click it to assign it to the ellipse. (You can try several colors until you find the best one.) If the ellipse came up with a stroke, middle-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> swatch in the lower-left corner of the status bar to remove it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="one_ellipse"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00020"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735408.png.jpg" alt="One ellipse"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-18. One ellipse</p></div><p>Draw a smaller ellipse on top of the head ellipse. What’s going on—is it invisible?! No. Ellipse (like most other tools) simply remembered the color you assigned to the head and now used the same color for the new ellipse, so it appears merged into the background of the larger head ellipse (although you can still see the selection frame around it). Scroll the palette back to the left and click the white color swatch to see the smaller ellipse:</p><div class="figure"><a id="two_ellipses"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00021"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735410.png.jpg" alt="Two ellipses"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-19. Two ellipses</p></div><p>This smaller ellipse is supposed to be the white of the boy’s eye. It’s probably not exactly the size you want the eye to be and is in a funny place for an eye. Switch to the Selector tool and drag the small ellipse to approximately where you want it. Then drag one of the arrow marks at the corners to make it approximately the right size, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch02s10.html#positioning_the_second_ellipse" title="Figure 2-20. Positioning the second ellipse">Figure 2-20</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="positioning_the_second_ellipse"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00022"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735412.png.jpg" alt="Positioning the second ellipse"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-20. Positioning the second ellipse</p></div><p><a id="iddle1421" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3096" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3783" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3915" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4001" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4850" class="indexterm"/>Now we need yet another ellipse for the pupil of the eye. Instead of going back to the Ellipse tool, however, we will use duplication. With the white ellipse still selected, press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00045"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. Nothing visibly changed, but we know that we now have two ellipses there, the new one being selected. Click the black color swatch, then drag the arrow marks again to make the pupil smaller and drag it into place:</p><div class="figure"><a id="head_and_one_eye"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00023"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735414.png.jpg" alt="Head and one eye"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-21. Head and one eye</p></div><p>The eye is ready—but we need two identical eyes. Let’s duplicate the entire eye we created. The eye consists of two separate objects, so before duplicating we need to select them both. You can do this either by dragging a rubber band around the eye (but make sure to start dragging from an empty space and not from the head ellipse, otherwise you’ll be dragging the head, which is not what you want!), or just click the pupil and then <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00046"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-click the white. Press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00047"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735374.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and drag the second eye sideways (both objects move when you drag any of them).</p><div class="figure"><a id="head_and_two_eyes"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00024"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735416.png.jpg" alt="Head and two eyes"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-22. Head and two eyes</p></div><p>Now, to finish the drawing, choose the Calligraphic pen tool and draw the nose, mouth, ear, and some hair (<a class="xref" href="ch02s10.html#welcome_to_the_worldexclamation_mark" title="Figure 2-23. Welcome to the world!">Figure 2-23</a>). If the paths appear in some wrong color, click black on the palette; after that, all new calligraphic paths will be black too. If the pen draws too wide or too thin, adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> value on the tool’s controls bar above the canvas. If something turns out wrong, undo by pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00048"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735418.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="welcome_to_the_worldexclamation_mark"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00025"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735420.png.jpg" alt="Welcome to the world!"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-23. Welcome to the world!</p></div><p><a id="iddle2114" class="indexterm"/>The image is ready, but we’re not finished yet with all the possibilities it offers. What you have done so far would be just as easy to do in a raster editor. But we’re in vector, so let’s use the specific vector advantages to play with the result. Using Selector, select both eyes’ whites and scale them up or down. Or move the pupils around. Or scale, rotate, and move the mouth. All of this creates a wide range of facial expressions. You can also select, duplicate, and drag away the entire drawing to present several examples side by side:</p><div class="figure"><a id="life_and_its_many_faces"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00026"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735422.png.jpg" alt="Life and its many faces"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2-24. Life and its many faces</p></div><p>Save or export the result.
