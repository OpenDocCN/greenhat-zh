    desire. It doesn''t matter if you manage a network with 400 separate manufacturing
    plants connected by a global MPLS mesh or if you''re responsible for three computers
    and an elderly printer. Network administrators all share an abiding and passionate
    desire for just one thing: We want our users to shut up.'

    that the network will work perfectly and make decisions accordingly. A user can't
    open that 900MB Excel spreadsheet on the file server on another continent from
    his 20th-century PC? Network problem. A website in Farawayistan is slow? Network
    problem. A user can't get a faster response over a 33.6Kbps modem? Network problem.
    In general, users don't care about trivialities such as the cost of bandwidth,
    the physical layout of transcontinental fiber, or the speed of light. They want
    the network to work the way they think it should.

- en: This problem is exacerbated by the network's invisibility. Routers and switches
    are black boxes. You feed cables to the network, and it gives connectivity back.
    Traditionally, servers have much better activity logging and reporting than network
    devices. Sysadmins can write scripts to announce when a server process fails and
    try to remedy the situation, but very few network administrators have equipment
    that can monitor or repair itself. The usage information stored on a network device
    shows only the last few minutes at best. When a user reports an application failure,
    many systems administrators check their logs and report, "I have no problems.
    It must be the network." More sophisticated network administrators have traffic
    measurement tools such as MRTG, CiscoWorks, or OpenView, but these don't prove
    a network has no problems. They merely show whether the network has or lacks the
    particular set of problems that the software can report. The lack of media errors
    on a switch's uplink port says nothing about TCP/IP errors or firewall issues.
    With such minimal logging, blaming the network becomes very easy and hard to disprove.

- en: In addition, modern-day network administrators typically have no formal certification
    or training process. The days of needing a computer science degree to manage a
    network are long gone. What network administration certifications exist are frequently
    for systems administration. An "operating system vendor-certified" network administrator
    is actually certified in the services that the operating system offers to the
    network, not the network itself. When you study for a Microsoft DHCP Server certification,
    for example, you learn some things about networking but a whole lot more about
    that particular DHCP implementation. Network service management is a useful skill,
    mind you, but it's not the same as managing the lowest level of the network. Network
    administrators learn the hard way—and it's a very hard way indeed.

    any organization. The network administrator can help resolve almost every technical
    issue. The network administrator can make himself an invaluable, indispensable,
    and irreplaceable component of the organization. A network administrator who masters
    the tools, understands the protocols, and restrains his natural contempt for the
    lesser minds surrounding him will not be fired until the company dissolves around
    him.

    a user or sysadmin reports an issue, this network admin is always ready to leap
    in with a packet analyzer or firewall log and offer insights. This is great customer
    service, *if* the user can replicate the problem at the time the network administrator
    is watching. Replicating problems consumes endless time and makes everyone involved
    testy.

    network yesterday or last week or last year? Imagine being able to precisely identify
    the network impact of server and hardware changes. Suppose you could tell systems
    administrators exactly what bogus traffic their new server transmitted? Just for
    a moment, dream about being able to categorically and without risk of repudiation
    state, "That problem was not the network." Then think about doing all that by
    taking advantage of your existing equipment.

    silence your users—nothing short of divine intervention can manage that. But you
    can identify problems on your network before they happen. You can answer questions
    authoritatively, definitively, and decisively. People will no longer automatically
    blame the network. Your work will become less stressful because you will no longer
    *think* you know what happened. You'll *know*.

    network administrator can transform into a network manager by doing the work required.
    You're in charge of your equipment, and you can probably scrounge up access to
    some computing resources somewhere. The most difficult investment will be your
    time. Once you start providing fact-based answers and diagnoses, however, people
    will notice the change. Over time, company management will start involving you
    in decisions about the network or even seek your advice about business processes
    built on top of the network, making you the de facto network manager no matter

    if you are familiar with existing network management tools. Many people are justifiably
    proud of their extensive network management systems. Let's take a look at some
    of the popular free network management tools and see how they fit together and
    how flow analysis can improve on them.

- en: MRTG, Cricket, and Cacti use SNMP to generate graphs of network traffic across
    device interfaces and store the results in a fixed-size database. Knowing how
    much traffic crosses your network at any time is an absolute necessity, and I
    make heavy use of such tools myself. The fixed-size databases mean that you don't
    need to worry about database administration; they're easy to set up, and they
    quickly produce useful information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing that your circuits are full explains why connectivity is slow, but the
    obvious next question is "full of what?" MRTG-style tools cannot answer that question.
    Flows can. Also, these tools normally use five-minute averages of traffic. They
    obscure brief spikes and valleys. Finally, these tools compress historical data
    into long-term averages. If you want to know the details of traffic six months
    ago, you must either extensively reconfigure these tools or use another tool.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like the previous tools, RTG uses SNMP to measure network traffic crossing device
    interfaces and graphs the data. Unlike MRTG and its descendants, RTG measures
    much briefer intervals of traffic and stores each individual result in a database.
    It provides much more detailed visibility into traffic congestion. If you want
    to see how traffic has varied on a network interface throughout a single minute,
    RTG is your friend. You can also perform detailed comparisons with historical
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The presence of a database means that you must either know something about databases
    or have an infinite amount of disk space. Also, RTG can't show you the contents
    of the traffic, only how much there was. It resolves one problem with MRTG-style
    tools but not the others.

    the health of your network gear. Free software such as Nagios and Big Brother
    is very useful in this regard; you can get an alarm when a switch's redundant
    power supply fails, when a port starts spewing CRC errors, or when a switch reboots
    itself. You must have this information to maintain a reliable network.
  prefs: []

    a switch is operating correctly doesn't mean that the traffic passing through
    it isn't having trouble. A functional switch or router will transmit undesirable
    traffic just as reliably as desirable traffic.

    are either tool kits with pretty frontends or limited to simple networks. These
    tools are seductive. They look like anyone can use them. But these tools often
    want to control your entire computing infrastructure, from router to desktop,
    and attempts to deploy them in production usually fail.

    suites to work the way you need, you've done just as much work as you would through
    building your own flow analysis system. You have had the satisfaction of giving
    some other company money that rightfully belongs in your pocket, however. (It's
    the boss's money, you say? Get a price quote for the commercial stuff. During
    your performance review, tell your manager that you got the same results without
    spending that cash and you'd like a slice of it. It's more likely to work than
    asking for a raise after spending that money.)

    contents of every network transaction. For a moment, think about the duties of
    a network administrator. Part of your responsibilities include providing network
    services, such as DNS and DHCP. You probably have to feed your proxy server every
    few days and dust the script kiddies out of the intrusion detection system each
    Monday morning. But set aside the services that run on the network for a moment,
    and consider the base network.

    for everything else. Most of the time, however, network administrators work on
    a team with system administrators, a database administrator or two, a help desk,
    and other IT professionals. In this case, the network administrator's responsibility
    is to deliver packets in a timely manner. Successful delivery of those packets
    completes your responsibilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will completely change your relationship with your co-workers. All of a sudden,
    you have *proof*. The network is no longer something that indiscriminately accepts
    the blame whenever something goes askew. Some of the errors will be your responsibility,
    of course. But many won't, and there's nothing like the glorious feeling of conclusively
    demonstrating for the very first time that not only is a problem not yours, but
    you can rigorously demonstrate where the problem lies. (The trick here lies in
    not alienating those same co-workers with said proof, but I'll talk about that
    later.)

- en: You don't need a complete record of the contents of traffic to demonstrate your
    point. All you need is proof that successful network-level communication occurred
    between hosts. If a user cannot display a page on your internal web server, for
    example, you don't need a full record of the contents of the network connections
    between the user's desktop and the server. You only need a record that a network
    conversation occurred between the client and the server, that the network carried
    data between the two, and that the conversation concluded normally and without
    error at the network level. You don't need to record every individual image or
    chunk of text in that conversation. That's not the network administrator's responsibility.
    Proving that the network carried web traffic between the client and the server
    demonstrates that the network functioned correctly. Mind you, as the network administrator,
    you're still on the hook for helping solve the problem; it's just that nobody
    will be blaming you as you work.

    kit. Although you can find many other tools for flow management, flow-tools has
    been around for the longest time and is the most widely deployed free toolkit.
    Many people have written flow analysis interfaces based on flow-tools, and I'll
    cover several of them in this book.

    BSDs, commercial options such as AIX, and many others. My reference platform is
    FreeBSD, but everything in this book also works on Linux. You might have difficulties
    using more challenging or unique platforms. This book provides examples of the
    commands for the flow management tools, but you must know how to invoke superuser
    privilege, navigate the file system, and so on.

    them for Perl aficionados.

    is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, in the UTC time zone.
    Any number of websites offer epoch-to-date converters. You can convert epoch seconds
    to a date on the command line with the `date` command, but the syntax varies among
    Unix-like operating systems.

    management capabilities. Therefore, I recommend installing and using Network Time
    Protocol. Use authoritative time sources for your network. If the timestamps in

    will be much easier.

    discussions of BGP-based flow data.
