- en: As I have already mentioned, one of the great things about Ubuntu is that it
    comes on a live CD, which means that you can try it before you install it . .
    . or never install it at all, if that's what you prefer. Better yet is the fact
    that, unlike earlier editions of Ubuntu, you don't need an additional installation
    CD if you do choose to install it—the Ubuntu Desktop CD functions as both a live
    CD and an install CD. And in the good-better-best swing of things, the best point
    of all is that installation from the live CD is actually much, much easier than
    any other installation process you've ever dealt with, and it even gives you more
    than one way to go about it.
  prefs: []

- en: In this chapter, I will cover the basics of starting up and running Ubuntu from
    the live CD and then, assuming you've caught the Linux bug, the painless steps
    of installing Ubuntu on your hard disk as your sole operating system, in its own
    partition on your hard disk in a traditional dual-boot setup (with Windows in
    its own partition), or, for the slightly less adventurous, from within your Windows
    system. If your computer doesn't have a CD drive, don't worry, you can still join
    in—take a look at [Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. INSTALLING UBUNTU FROM A
    USB FLASH DRIVE") to see how you can run or install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive
    instead. Whatever way you end up going about things, let's put this book to use
    and get Ubuntu up and running.

    see whether it's all comfy-cozy with Ubuntu), there is probably no better way
    to go than to run Ubuntu directly from the live CD. To do this, just place the
    Ubuntu Desktop CD in your disc drive and restart your machine. When the machine
    starts up, it should boot up from the CD, and after a second or two, you should
    see a purple Ubuntu startup screen with a couple of icons at the bottom of it.
    If the screen does not appear and your machine instead boots up into your usual
    operating system, then it is very likely that your machine's BIOS settings need
    to be changed to allow you to boot from a CD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can access your machine's BIOS by restarting and then pressing whatever
    key the onscreen startup instructions assign to accessing the BIOS setup. This
    is usually **delete** or F1 (F2, F10, and **esc** are also common), but not all
    machines are the same. If the onscreen information passes by so fast that you
    miss it, you can check your user's manual to see what the correct key is. Once
    you get into the BIOS setup, change the boot sequence so that your CD drive is
    first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once your machine boots from the live CD and you see the purple Ubuntu startup
    screen, either you can wait for a few seconds for Ubuntu to start booting into
    the live CD proper or you can press a key (any key) to display a menu where you
    can choose your language and other settings. The default settings should suffice
    for our purposes, so leave the keyboard untouched for a few seconds, and the purple
    screen will give way to a loading screen (also purple).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a couple of minutes or so, the loading screen will disappear, and in its
    place will come an Install window like the one in [Figure 2-1](ch02.html#the_ubuntu_live_cd_apostrophy_s_install
    "Figure 2-1. The Ubuntu live CD's Install window"). You should now be able to
    use your mouse as well as the keyboard, so unless you want to change the language
    using the list on the left of the screen, click the **Try Ubuntu 10.04** button
    to start a live session. After a few more seconds of loading, you'll be presented
    with an Ubuntu desktop, all run from the CD. And remember, your hard disk will
    go untouched, so rest easy—you're not going to change, let alone hurt, anything.
    When you get to this point, you're ready to roll—but I'll hold off on talking
    about that until [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. A NEW PLACE TO CALL HOME").

    you'll be asked to remove the CD from the drive and press **enter**. The computer
    will restart and return you to your normal Windows desktop soon after. If you
    have no luck with the Restart button for some reason, it should be safe to just
    turn your computer off and then on again using the power button on the front of
    it.

    because there is now an installation option called *Wubi* that lets you install
    Ubuntu directly on your Windows C: drive as if it were any other Windows program.
    Once installed, every time you start up your machine, you will be able to choose
    between starting up into Windows or into Ubuntu from the Windows bootloader screen.
    Your Windows system stays as it is; you don''t have to partition your hard disk;
    and if you want to get rid of Ubuntu later for whatever reason, you can do so
    like you would with any other Windows application. It''s a great way to go about

    really give you the full experience you would normally get from a dedicated Ubuntu
    installation. It also takes longer to install, because Wubi needs to download
    the installation files from the Internet (the right ones aren't on the CD). But
    it is a pretty good compromise—it definitely runs quicker and is much, much more
    usable and enjoyable than an Ubuntu live CD session. You also have the added benefit
    of being able to save files and settings to disk, which means you can follow along
    with anything described in this book. Pretty cool.

    and for them to happily coexist. This is known as a *dual-boot setup*. It has
    also become incredibly easy to set up such a system. I started out with a dual-boot
    setup, though I eventually found that I used the Linux side of things exclusively.
    Having so much disk space being taken up by a Windows system I didn't use seemed
    a waste of prime real estate, so eventually I just dumped the whole thing and
    went for a straight Linux-only setup.

    Windows first and then, when you're ready, go for a Linux-only setup and ditch
    Windows completely. Most people find that Ubuntu can do everything they need,
    so there's no need to dual-boot unless you require some specific application that
    has no equivalent on Linux.

    Linux or choose Windows instead. After that, bootup proceeds as normal for the
    system you selected. This setup works fine and is easy to use, so you needn't
    worry.

    however, you'll have to defragment your disk manually. In Windows XP, you can
    do this by double-clicking **My Computer**, right-clicking the icon for your hard
    disk, and selecting **Properties**. You can then defragment your hard disk by
    clicking the **Tools** tab in the Properties window and clicking the **Defragment
    Now** button. In Windows 2000, you can do this by going to the **Start** menu
    and selecting **Control Panel** ▸ **Administrative Tools** ▸ **Computer Management**
    ▸ **Disk Defragmenter**, while in Windows 98 and some other versions, you can
    do the same by selecting **Programs** ▸ **Accessories** ▸ **System Tools** ▸ **Disk

    In an Ubuntu installation, on the other hand, you are installing not only the

    Needless to say, there is no need for such concern. As long as you have backed
    up your data, you will be OK. If you screw up the installation the first time
    out, so what? Just start over again. No harm done, because you have nothing to
    harm. Just make sure that you give yourself more time than you need for the process.
    Don't start installing one hour before you have to be at work or before you have
    to meet your friend downtown. Rushing makes people do weird things. Make things
    easy on yourself by giving yourself plenty of time and, as I mentioned before,

    "Appendix C. MANUALLY PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK"), if you fancy taking control
    of the process yourself. There should be no need to, however, since the Ubuntu
    installer will be happy to handle the task for you.

    separate partitions for your data and system files (convenient if you ever need
    to reinstall or want to easily share files between Windows and Ubuntu), you'll
    need to specify the partitions manually using the last option. This is more advanced—check
    out [Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. MANUALLY PARTITIONING YOUR HARD DISK")
    for some guidance. Once your selection is made, click **Forward**.

    to log in and to decrypt my home folder option at the bottom of the window. This
    will encrypt your home folder (where all your documents are stored) so that no
    one can see any of the files in it without your password. This is nice to have
    if you work with confidential information, since the data will be pretty safe
    even if your computer is stolen.
