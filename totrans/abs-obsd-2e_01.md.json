ECHO_REQUEST datagrams\n     (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a \"struct timeval\"\n     and then an arbitrary number of \"pad\" bytes used to fill out the\n     packet. The options are as follows:\n     -c count\n             Stop sending after count ECHO_REQUEST packets have been sent. If\n             count is 0, send an unlimited number of packets.\n     -D      Set the Don't Fragment bit.\n…\n```", "```\n$ **apropos vi**\n…\nvmware (4) - VMware SVGA video driver\nvoodoo (4) - Voodoo video driver\nwsudl (4) - video driver for DisplayLink USB display devices\nxcmsdb (1) - Device Color Characterization utility for X Color Management System\n…\n```", "```\n$ **whatis vi**\nex, vi, view (1) - text editors\n```", "```\n$ **whatis sysctl**\nsysctl (3) - get or set system information\nsysctl (8) - get or set kernel state\nsysctl.conf (5) - sysctl variables to set at system startup\n```", "```\n$ **apropos cryptography**\nRSA_public_encrypt, RSA_private_decrypt (3) - RSA public key cryptography\n```", "```\n$ **whatis crypto**\ncrypto (3) - OpenSSL cryptographic library\ncrypto (4) - hardware crypto access driver\ncrypto (9) - API for cryptographic services in the kernel\n```"]
