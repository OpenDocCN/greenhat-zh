    What Vector Graphics Is and Why It Matters](ch01s01.html "1.1 What Vector Graphics
    Is and Why It Matters")**), and Inkscape’s SVG documents are no exception. Many
    vector drawings, artistic as well as technical, are developed from tracings of
    photos, scans, or other bitmap drawings; at the other end of its lifetime, almost
    all vector art is eventually exported into bitmap formats for viewing in software
    that cannot deal directly with vectors. Bitmaps are an important object type in
    Inkscape, and the techniques for dealing with them are sufficiently versatile
    to warrant a whole chapter to cover them.

    Inkscape document by using the **File** ▸ **Import** command. Inkscape can deal
    with a large number of bitmap formats, including all of the major ones (PNG, JPG,
    TIFF, GIF, and BMP). Choose **All Bitmaps** for the type of the files in the **Import**
    dialog so that only the supported bitmap formats are in the list.

    in its own right. In this case, Inkscape automatically creates a new SVG document,
    its page size (**[3.4.3 Page Size](ch03s04.html#threedot4dot3_page_size "3.4.3
    Page Size")**) matching the pixel size of the bitmap, and places the bitmap on
    the canvas (into the document root—that is, not in any layer). You can now add
    vector objects to that document and save it as SVG (if you want to get a bitmap
    with the result, you need to export it, **[18.9 Bitmap Export](ch18s09.html "18.9
    Bitmap Export")**), or you can copy and paste the bitmap object from that document
    into any other.

    is described as *Image* with its pixel size, for example *640 × 480*.

    "1.1 What Vector Graphics Is and Why It Matters")**), and Inkscape does not attempt
    to conceal this fact. Just zoom in close enough, and you will easily see the separate
    pixels in a bitmap object as flat-color squares. By default, all bitmaps are imported
    at the resolution of 90 pixels per inch, which means the size of each pixel square
    is exactly 1×1 px (**[A.6 Coordinates and Units](apas06.html "A.6 Coordinates
    and Units")**). If you squeeze, skew, or rotate the bitmap, its pixels will be
    transformed correspondingly.

    This means that the actual content of the bitmap is taken from the original bitmap
    file; what the SVG document contains is just a reference to that file—its filename,
    including path. This way, the SVG file size is kept to a minimum, and multiple
    SVG documents can reuse the same bitmap file. The status bar description of a
    linked bitmap object reports its filename ([Figure 18-1](ch18s01.html#bitmap_objects_in_a_document_and_the_sta

    Inkscape (for example, color correction or cropping) will be immediately reflected
    in the Inkscape document. Moreover, you can run an external editor (such as GIMP
    or Photoshop) on your linked image from inside Inkscape by right-clicking the
    bitmap object and choosing **Edit externally**. On the **Bitmaps** page of **Inkscape
    Preferences** (**[3.1.1 Inkscape Preferences](ch03s01.html#threedot1dot1_inkscape_preferences

    bitmaps as well as choose which external editor you want to use.

    by moving the rectangle handles inward. At the same time, you can also use the
    pattern’s three handles to move, scale, and rotate the pattern, as described in
    **[10.8.2 Editing Patterns](ch10s08.html#one0dot8dot2_editing_patterns "10.8.2

  prefs: []

    the object inside that path will be visible. Starting from a bitmap object, draw
    a clipping path or shape over it using any convenient tool—for example, Calligraphic
    pen or Pencil. Then, select both the bitmap and the path and choose **Object**
    ▸ **Clip** ▸ **Set**. The clipping path disappears (it now resides in `defs`,
    **[A.4 Defs, View, and Metadata](apas04.html "A.4 Defs, View, and Metadata")**)

    is that a clip limits the object to the interior of the clipping path, disregarding
    any embellishments such as fill color, stroke style, gradient, or blur. Clipping
    is *binary*; at any point, the clipped object is either visible or not. Masking,
    however, is *gradual*—it may make an object *partially* transparent.'

    areas of the object not covered by a mask at all or areas that fall into gaps
