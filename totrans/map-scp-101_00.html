The first online, on-demand driving directions from MapQuest very nearly rendered traditional road atlases obsolete. Today, many websites that provide driving directions also make their maps available to developers. Using these mapping APIs, you can plot your own points or make a mashup with geo-data from other websites.</p><p>This book shows you how to take advantage of these services and include their maps on your site. Instead of limiting you to one provider, I'll show you how to use all of them via an open source library called <span class="emphasis"><em>Mapstraction</em></span>. Write your code once and watch it work in Google Maps, Bing, MapQuest, Yahoo!, OpenStreetMap, and more.</p><p>In addition to teaching you how to work with maps from these providers, I'll show you many other common geographic projects. You'll learn how to calculate the distance between locations and embed driving directions on your own site. You'll also learn how to customize the way your map looks by adding your own icons, adding large graphic overlays, or even completely changing the underlying map imagery.</p><p>Bringing location to the Web by embedding maps is an important part of most sites now, but there's also an increasing need to bring the Web "on location" to smartphones running mobile browsers. You can add maps to mobile versions of your site using the techniques shown in this book. And I'll show you how to use a convenient geolocation standard to find your user's location, whether he's using a phone, a tablet, or even a regular computer.</p><p>You are just pages away from adding some <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> to your website. This book is designed to help you quickly get to work on an application you already have in mind or inspire your next map. To that end, I've organized the book into projects. And once you become a map scripting wizard, I hope this book will be useful enough as a reference to earn a spot on your bookshelf.</p><div class="sect1" title="About This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="about_this_book"/>About This Book</h1></div></div></div><p>The book's project-based approach starts off with basic examples then picks up speed quickly. If you're one to jump ahead, I'd recommend you at least read <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#create_a_mapstraction_map" title="Create a Mapstraction Map">Create a Mapstraction Map</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#create_a_mapstraction_map" title="Create a Mapstraction Map">Create a Mapstraction Map</a> first. Almost every example in the book builds upon the map you will create in that section.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. MAPPING BASICS">Chapter 1</a> you'll learn the basics of constructing online maps. I'll introduce Mapstraction and show how to add controls, such as a zoom interface, to your maps.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. PLOTTING MARKERS AND MESSAGE BOXES">Chapter 2</a> you'll start adding your own points to the map. You'll create custom icons and add message boxes to describe locations.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. GEOCODING">Chapter 3</a> you'll learn many ways to convert addresses and city names to coordinates that mapping providers can understand. This process, called <span class="emphasis"><em>geocoding</em></span>, is a big part of making mapping human-friendly.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. LAYER IT ON">Chapter 4</a> you'll add more complex layers to your map. You'll learn how to draw lines to describe routes and shapes to outline borders. You'll even see how to take large graphics, geo-reference them, and then add them as a map overlay.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. HANDLE MAP EVENTS">Chapter 5</a> you'll make your maps respond to events, such as drags, clicks, and zooms. These hooks allow you to create an even more interactive experience for your users.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. EXPLORE PROXIMITY">Chapter 6</a> we'll explore proximity. You'll learn how to create driving directions or search around a point. You'll also dive into some more advanced topics, such as determining whether a location is within a shape (known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>hit test</em></span>).</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. USER LOCATION">Chapter 7</a> you'll learn several simple ways to access your user's location with various degrees of accuracy. I'll cover using the geolocation standard, falling back on IP address data, and integrating with location sharing services.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. DATA FORMATS">Chapter 8</a> you'll focus on common location data formats used on the Web. You'll learn to parse GeoRSS, Google Earth's KML, and XML output from most GPS devices.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. GO SERVER-SIDE">Chapter 9</a> it's time to go server side. You'll get a crash course in PHP and MySQL, two technologies provided by many web hosts. We'll then use these languages for common location tasks, such as finding the closest points from your own database.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. MASHUP PROJECTS">Chapter 10</a> you'll put it all together with five fun mashups. You'll create a Twitter tweet finder, an interactive weather map, and a way to find a coffee shop between two locations (so you can meet a friend in the middle). There's also a local concert finder and a way to visualize earthquakes around the world.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="How to Use This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_to_use_this_book"/>How to Use This Book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book introduces cartography to web developers, and shows cartographers and other geo-folks how to move their maps online. It is written for beginning and advanced programmers alike—your skill level and knowledge of mapping will impact how you use the book. <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. MAPPING BASICS">Chapter 1</a> is a good place for everyone to start, because most of the later examples build upon the basic maps presented there.</p><p>If you haven't used JavaScript before, or if you need a refresher, be sure to read <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. JAVASCRIPT QUICK START">Appendix A</a>. This will give you a primer on the concepts used throughout the book and provide a quick introduction to the JavaScript framework jQuery.</p><p>Each chapter builds upon earlier chapters, so you can read from beginning to end as you expand your mapping knowledge. This book also works well as a reference—you can skip around to find the concepts you want to learn, or find the chapter or project you need for your current application.</p><p>Another part of the book that you'll find useful is <a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. MAPSTRACTION REFERENCE">Appendix B</a>, a reference that details the classes and functions within Mapstraction. This reference serves as a quick way to check syntax and gives examples of how to use each function.</p></div>
