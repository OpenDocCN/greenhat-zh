    A growing company's culture helps define the company and makes it unique. If a
    culture is easily identifiable and projects itself in a positive light, prospective
    employees will be attracted to the company and current employees will be more
    likely to stay with the firm. From a purely financial standpoint, a positive culture

- en: When you're asked to lead a development team in a small company, your new relationship
    with the CEO and other members of the executive team can be one of your largest
    and most unsettling adjustments. The CEO is your boss, your peers are the executive
    team, and you aren't in Kansas anymore. You are accountable for the entire company's
    technical practices and how the development team's software affects business.
    You no longer define success based on your technical capabilities alone. You need
    good people skills and the proper attitude to be successful in your new role.

    levels in a company. They are based on the company's business needs and focus
    on a management perspective, not on superiority of one technology over another.
    Consequently, you will need to understand the business aspects of your decisions
    and incorporate the opinions and knowledge of other executive team members as
    you make those decisions.

    style and priorities. In any business, CEOs and presidents tend to focus on areas
    in which they have the most expertise. CEOs with a sales background, for example,
    may focus on company sales and have a shorter-term focus. CEOs with a technology
    background may dig into the technology, sometimes overemphasizing its importance
    over market and customers. CEOs with a marketing background may value the product
    and market, not always pulling together the operational pieces. By understanding
    your boss's background, you can determine the best ways to provide him or her
    with information as well as how to make a winning business case for efforts you
    want to undertake. So, for example, with a finance-focused CEO, you could make
    the case for the revenue benefits of your efforts; with an operations-focused
    CEO, you could emphasize productivity; and with a marketing-focused CEO, you could
    spotlight the market penetration benefits.

    you understand each of these goals, but you can make sure by repeating them back

    have changed.

    and specific long- and short-term goals. Goals should not be viewed merely as
    a to-do list, but as a vision of success that can help you create a mental picture
    of what you need to achieve and why. As you discuss these goals, work with your
    boss to define them in a way that is both sensible and achievable. After you have
    spent some time reviewing the goals, discuss problems or questions to be sure
    you understand each completely—blindly charging ahead without fully understanding
    what is expected of you can lead to many wrong turns and will ultimately hurt
    your team and the company. Work with your boss to ensure that each goal will benefit

    often change throughout the year. What was crucial at the beginning of the year

    is a bit understaffed or underequipped. The VP of finance will focus on financial
    regulations, accounting, longer-term financial health, and keeping the cash flow
    positive; he may oppose the purchase of extra equipment, even if it will help
    with development. The VP of marketing, on the other hand, may prefer to drive
    the product toward general solutions that strengthen its position in the marketplace;
    development tools are the least of her worries. And *you* want your team to be

    need from sales to make estimates. Splitting estimates into *firm quotes* and
    *rough quotes* can be useful in a cooperative environment. You can generate rough
    quotes faster than firm quotes and use ranges of delivery dates that require less

    to the client's needs and then makes promises on what can be delivered to match
    those needs. Unfortunately, on occasion, sales people will promise clients engineering
    deliverables without first consulting you. In a poorly managed company, the CEO
    gives the sales team incentives to sell but enforces few controls over what they
    can sell. If the client's needs are greater than the product can deliver, a naïve,
    less-than-ethical, or uninformed sales person can promise the additional functionality
    without first confirming that those promises can be kept.

    more reasonable, development team deliverables. Almost every engineering manager
    has run into the problem of unexpected customer promises by overeager sales people,

    even a relatively small client can "hijack" the development calendar, ultimately
    stunting future growth that depends on some planned functionality.

    of the market and toward one particular customer's needs. Instead of each sale
    demonstrating the market potential for the product, this sale diverts the company

    offering instead of bolting new features on to the current offering for one customer.

    Long sales cycles are also common for *software as a service (SAS)* offerings
    in which the long-term customer costs of the relationship are high. For these
    types of software purchases, customers investigate the product and service thoroughly
    before making a purchase because of the potential impact to their businesses.
    This investigation often starts with a *request for quote (RFQ)*, sometimes called
    a *request for procurement* (or a *proposal*). An RFQ usually requires that engineering
    contribute information.

    Typically, the sales team will be responsible for supplying RFQ responses. Sales
    will send customer requests to development and other teams to provide the information
    required to complete the quote. Most RFQs include questions appropriate for engineering
    that help the customer assess how the software works as well as its risks and
    reliability. Typically, the RFQ requires a quick turnaround from engineering.
