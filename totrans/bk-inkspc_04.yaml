    (accessible by pressing ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735480.png.jpg)
    or by choosing a command in the **Object** menu). This dialog is quite small,

    is the `id` attribute of the corresponding element in the SVG source of the document
    ([Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. An SVG Primer")). Its value is always unique
    inside this document; Inkscape provides unique IDs for all objects automatically.
    You can, however, change this value as long as it remains unique.

    representation of what is called the *bounding box* of the object—the smallest
    possible rectangle which completely encloses the entire object. The bounding box
    is always upright, that is, its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes; if
    you rotate an object, its bounding box may or may not change its size, but it
    won’t rotate with the object. (Try rotating the ellipse by pressing the square

    to switch from one type to the other, go to the **Tools** tab of the **Inkscape
    Preferences** dialog. The difference is that the visual bounding box, unlike the
    geometric, includes *everything that’s visible* about the object—most notably
    its entire stroke (**[9.1 Stroke Width](ch09s01.html "9.1 Stroke Width")**) but
    also markers (**[9.5 Markers](ch09s05.html "9.5 Markers")**) and filter margins

    Usually, the geometric bounding box is preferred by those who use Inkscape for
    technical drawing, while the visual option makes more sense for almost everyone
    else. [Figure 4-3](ch04s02.html#bounding_box_of_an_object_is_always_upri "Figure 4-3. The

    each other. An object on top in the z-order may obscure those below it, if they
    overlap and if the top object is not transparent. The term *z-order* derives from
    the notion of the third coordinate axis, Z, which is imagined to extend perpendicular
    to the X/Y plane of the drawing toward the viewer. Objects higher in the z-order
