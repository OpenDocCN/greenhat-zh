<p class="docText1"><a name="OpenVPN is" class="calibre8" id="OpenVPN is"/>OpenVPN is an open source VPN implementation that uses the OpenSSL library to encrypt data traveling over a public network. A <span class="docEmphasis1">VPN (virtual private network)</span><a name="private connection" class="calibre8" id="private connection"/> is a private connection from one point to another that utilizes an existing network as a transport medium. VPNs are popular with businesses because they allow secure communication between sites or employees without the need to lease dedicated WAN (wide area network) lines.<a name="IDX-CHP-19-0288" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0288"/><a name="IDX-CHP-19-0289" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0289"/><a name="IDX-CHP-19-0290" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0290"/><a name="IDX-CHP-19-0291" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0291"/><a name="IDX-CHP-19-0292" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0292"/><a name="IDX-CHP-19-0293" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0293"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="in early" class="calibre8" id="in early"/>James Yonan began developing OpenVPN in early 2002. Yonan's employer at the time afforded him the freedom to telecommute. As a result, he became interested in telecommunication tools. His examination of the open source VPN community revealed a divide between security-conscious and usability-based software projects. Yonan's OpenVPN has grown into a very popular and complete VPN solution that addresses both security and usability issues. Yonan continues development of OpenVPN as project leader.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="several VPN" class="calibre8" id="several VPN"/>There are several VPN implementations, each of which offers various levels of security and functionality.</p>
<ul class="calibre15"><li class="calibre16"><p class="docText1"><a name="Tunneling Protocol" class="calibre8" id="Tunneling Protocol"/>PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) is used to implement some VPNs. It is considered insecure due to a publicly known security exploit.<a name="IDX-CHP-19-0294" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0294"/></p></li><li class="calibre16"><p class="docText1"><a name="secure VPN" class="calibre8" id="secure VPN"/>L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with Internet Protocol Security) is a reasonably secure VPN solution. However, it has problems traversing many basic NAT routers.</p></li><li class="calibre16"><p class="docText1"><a name="proven to" class="calibre8" id="proven to"/>OpenVPN is a cross-platform VPN solution that has proven to be secure, sustainable across NAT routers, and scalable. OpenVPN does require client software installation to function and can be complicated to set up initially.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText1">OpenVPN supports routed or bridged VPNs. A <span class="docEmphasis1">routed VPN</span><a name="over the" class="calibre8" id="over the"/> creates a virtual subnet for the client and routes traffic over the VPN if addressed to a system on the remote side. A <span class="docEmphasis1">bridged VPN</span><a name="is broadcast" class="calibre8" id="is broadcast"/> connects clients to an existing network subnet. Data is broadcast through the bridge like a virtual Ethernet hub. A bridged VPN tunnel can provide a client with the same network functionality as being connected locally to that network. This guide outlines the setup of a bridged VPN rather than the default routed method.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="VPN joins" class="calibre8" id="VPN joins"/>A bridged VPN joins remote clients to a local network as if they were onsite, with all of the benefits of being on that local network. Also, bridged VPNs can use non-routable protocols (required by Windows file shares, broadcast traffic, LAN games, and so on) that small office and home office users may find useful.<a name="IDX-CHP-19-0295" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-19-0295"/></p>
