  Voiding the Warranty</h1>

  <h2 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_5"><b class="calibre3">Tools of the Trade</b></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Hardware hacking may seem daunting at first because of the sophisticated tools that are required for some projects. Fortunately, most basic projects can be accomplished with only a small investment in tools, comparable to the price of one or two video games. Appendix A, “Where to Get Equipment,” contains a suggested list of starter tools and instructions on how to order these tools.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This chapter will talk about basic tools you will need for serious hardware hacking, including tools to open things up, attach and remove electronic components, diagnose and probe circuits, and design circuit boards. Of these tools, good quality versions of the first two can be purchased at fairly reasonable prices. Diagnostic and test tools such as oscil oscopes and logic analyzers are worth their weight in gold, but you’ll find that these are very heavy and they wil be a formidable investment. As for circuit board design tools, some of the best tools can come at surpris ingly affordable prices.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This chapter will conclude with a step-by-step pictorial tutorial on how to open up the Xbox. More experienced hardware hackers can skip the next couple of chapters.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_6"><b class="calibre3">Tools to Open Things Up</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">The first step in hacking anything is getting the cover off. Most electronic appliances can be opened with just a set of Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, but the most interesting boxes will require a set of special security bits.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="drawing" src="../Images/index-34_1.png"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-1:</b> A selection of security bits. From left to right: Nintendo 4.5mm, security torx, standard torx, clutch, Robertson or square, tri-wing, torq, spanner, and security allen or hex.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Figure 1-1 shows a lineup of some common security bits. Surprisingly, security bit sets are affordable and easy to obtain. MCM Electronics (www.mcmelectronics.com) sel s a 105-piece security bit set (MCM order number 22-3495) for under twenty dollars, and a 32 piece set (MCM order number 22-1875) for under ten dollars. They are well worth the investment. Nintendo security bits are sold separately. You can get the large Nintendo security bit, used in the Nintendo Gamecube, for a few dollars (MCM order number 22-1150, “4.5mm Security Bit”). A smaller version of the bit (MCM order number 22-1145, “3.8mm Security Bit”) is also used in the older Nintendo systems and their game cartridges.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Xbox uses standard torx (six-pointed star) bits of the T10, T15 and T20 size. These bits are fairly common and can be purchased at hardware stores such as Home Depot. You may also find a magnetic extension bit holder handy for reaching into a couple of tight spots around the hard drive and DVD drive in the Xbox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Do not use excessive force when taking the cover off equipment. If you think you have removed all of the screws but the cover is still stuck, most likely you have either missed a screw, or you need to depress some friction lock tabs. Too, many times screws are hidden beneath the rubber feet on the bottom of equipment, or under a sticker label. To find screws hidden by sticker labels, firmly rub the surface of the label. You will feel a soft spot wherever there is a screw underneath. (Breaking such a label to access the screw instantly voids the equipment’s warranty, but have no fear: Most equipment is designed to be serviced, so simply removing the cover rarely causes any damage.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On occasion, you will encounter a stubborn assembly that refuses to come apart. If the cover or panel flexes open around the edges or seems to have some freedom of movement, there may be some kind of friction lock holding the cover on. Friction locks are typically tab-and-slot structures, shaped so that it is much easier to insert the tab than to remove it. In this case, locate the tab by observing where the case seems to be stuck, and push in on the tab with a small flathead screwdriver while gently pulling up on the case. If there are multiple tabs like this, insert a wedge of some kind, such as another screwdriver or a paperclip, to prevent the tab from re-engaging as you open the other tabs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If the cover or panel refuses to move even slightly when you apply firm pressure, it may also be attached with adhesive or it may even be welded shut. For example, “wall-wart” power supplies (the square black boxes that you plug directly into wall outlets) are often sealed in such a fashion. Taking such a piece of equipment apart may mean you’ll never be able to get it back together into its original form.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_7"><b class="calibre3">Tools to Attach and Remove Components</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">Electronic components are attached to boards by <i class="calibre4">soldering</i>. When soldering, a low-melting-point alloy known as solder is heated and flowed around the metals to be joined. The solder and the metals form a local alloy. Once the joint cools, the components are electrically and mechanically connected.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The basic tools for soldering are a soldering iron, solder, flux, and desoldering braid. (A pair of fine-tipped tweezers is also quite handy for jobs that involve fine-pitch components or small parts.) A soldering iron is a hand-held tool that consists of a heating element and a tip; the tip is used to melt solder alloys through conduction or direct contact, unlike other tools that use hot gases or intense infra-red radiation. The kind of soldering iron tip required for optimal heat transfer depends upon the situation. For example, a flattened “chisel” or “conical chisel” tip will perform better than a simple pointed tip when soldering most small surface mount components.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are also many grades of soldering irons. The cheapest ones cost around ten dollars and come with large, unwieldy tips and have no temperature control; they just get as hot as they can. Better soldering irons cost more and have a sensor that actively regulates the tip’s temperature. Temperature regulation makes the tool’s action more consistent, and extends the life of the tip. Better irons also come with a wider selection of tips that may include very fine ones, suitable for working with the tiny components found in most electronics today. For light use, a quality direct-plug soldering iron with a good tip is sufficient. However, if you plan on building boards and really getting into hardware hacking, a hundred dollars for a quality temperature-controlled soldering iron such as the Weller WTCPT or the Weller WES50 is well worth the investment.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Solders come in a wide variety. For most purposes, a eutectic Pb-Sn alloy solder wire with a no-clean or water-cleanable flux core is sufficient. Eutectic alloys are desirable because they go directly from a liquid phase to a homogenous solid. Kester is a major manufacturer of solders; their standard cored wire solders, Formula 245 and 331, are both pretty good. Formula 245 uses a no-clean flux, but if you like, you can use a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol to remove the residue. Formula 331 has a flux core that works on more materials than 245. However, with 331 you need to wash down the board with water soon after soldering, or the flux residue will become gummy and possibly interfere with circuit operation. Many distributors sell Kester solder; for example, Kester 24-6337-8802 (25-gauge Formula 245 solder wire in a 1-lb spool) is DigiKey (www.digikey.com) part number KE1410-ND. The kind of solder sold at most Radio Shack’s is also quite good for soldering, although their solder tends to leave a sticky black residue and require cleanup with organic solvents.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Solder can also come as paste, with tiny solder balls suspended in a flux matrix. Solder paste can be very useful when attaching fine-pitched surface mount components. (See Appendix B, “Soldering Techniques,” for more information.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If a solder connection is stubborn to form, flux is the panacea. Always keep some flux on hand. When a joint is not forming correctly, a small drop of flux applied directly to the joint will typically fix the problem. Flux also comes in a wide variety of pastes and liquids, each of which requires a different cleanup method. A convenient flux application solution is the flux pen, such as Kester 83-1000-0951, a Formula 951 no-clean flux pen. You can purchase this flux pen from Digi-Key, part number KE1804-ND, for just a few dollars. Radio Shack also sells a flux paste in a tube, but their paste is messy and it requires clean-up. Finally, desoldering braids are useful for cleaning up any soldering messes or mistakes you might make. A desoldering braid is a fine braided copper wire, typically laced with dry flux. To use it, place it between the soldering iron and the joint you want to clean up; once the braid is hot, the excess solder on the joint will wick into the desoldering braid’s capillaries. Even though the braid may be pre-fluxed, applying a drop of flux to the braid prior to use still helps the process. Chemtronics makes a nice line of desoldering braids; an example part is Chemtronics 60-3-5 “No-Clean Solder-Wick” (Digi-Key part number 60-3-5-ND).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I discuss the basic technique for soldering at the beginning of Chapter 2, where you learn how to install a blue LED in the Xbox’s front panel.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_8"><b class="calibre3">Tools to Test and Diagnose</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">Electronic test equipment comes in as many forms as there are electronic products. For a beginner, the basic “must-have” tool is a digital multimeter. Digital multimeters (DMMs) have become very featureful and affordable in the past few years; a typical unit will be able to measure resistance, voltage, current, capacitance, diode polarity and continuity, for a price of around fifty dollars. Radio Shack and Jameco (www.jameco.com) both carry a reasonable selection of entry-level multimeters. (Appendix A, “Where to Get your Hacking Gear,” has a suggestion for an entry-level multimeter.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For basic modification and kit-build projects, DMMs are useful for checking for shorted connections, and for checking the basic health of a circuit before and after applying power. Continuity mode in a DMM can be helpful when you feel like you may have messed up a solder connection. In continuity mode, the DMM will emit a tone whenever a low-resistance path exists between the test probes. Thus, the continuity feature is useful for both verifying the integrity of a solder joint, and for checking for shorts with adjacent connections. You should not use continuity mode to check for power supply shorts, because some boards will quite normally have a sufficiently low resistance between power and ground (ten ohms or so) to trigger the continuity tone. Thus, before applying power to any newly modified or built board, use the resistance measuring mode to check and make sure that there is no dead short (zero ohms of resistance) on the power lines.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For reverse engineering and more advanced projects, the basic tools you’ll need are an oscilloscope and sometimes a logic analyzer. Oscilloscopes are useful for capturing the detailed shape of electrical waveforms. One can diagnose timing, noise and interference problems with an oscilloscope.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The oscilloscope’s basic defining characteristics are the number of channels or waveforms it can display simultaneously, and its maximum electrical bandwidth. High-quality oscilloscopes typically have four channels and over 500 MHz of bandwidth; discount or used oscilloscopes often have only two channels and somewhere between 20 MHz and 100 MHz of usable bandwidth. The chief limitation of all oscilloscopes is that they can only display a short segment of an electrical waveform.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Logic analyzers are useful for capturing large quantities of digital data. They trade off the ability to capture waveform shape for expansive data analysis and logging capabilities. Logic analyzers are useful for diagnosing complex digital busses and circuits. The basic defining characteristics of a logic analyzer are the number of digital channels it can sample, the maximum sampling rate, and the maximum sampling depth. A typical modern logic analyzer may have several dozen channels, a sampling rate in the hundreds of megahertz, and a sampling depth of a couple megabytes. Other features found in logic analyzers are programmable trigger algorithms and the ability to detect glitches or runt pulses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, the average price of a new oscilloscope or logic analyzer runs in the thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. The good news is that most projects will not require the latest and greatest in test technology, so you can get away with second-hand equipment. Swapfests are great places to pick up an old scope or analyzer for cheap; eBay also has some good deals from time to time. If you have to make a choice between purchasing an oscilloscope and a logic analyzer, I’d recommend getting the oscilloscope first; a logic analyzer is not nearly as versatile as an oscilloscope, and is typically more expensive. Oscilloscopes can be coaxed into capturing a limited amount of logic data, whereas a logic analyzer can never be used to measure an analog waveform. Also, it is easier to build your own home-brew logic analyzer using FPGAs and custom boards than it is to build an oscilloscope of comparable quality. Home-brew logic analyzers can be built to work in high-end, high-speed applications relatively cheaply. (Chapter 8 describes how I built a homebrew logic analyzer to eavesdrop on a critical high-speed bus in the Xbox.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In a pinch, a very simple digital trace capture device can be built with about fifty dollars in Radio Shack parts. Once, I had to capture the data on a PS/2 keyboard port, but I didn’t have any test equipment, and I needed to capture the data right away. A breadboard with several bargraph LEDs wired to a set of 8-bit registers (part number 74HCT574) wired to shift data did the trick — all components that I bought at Radio Shack. The actual design is fairly simple, but because its use is very limited, but I’ll spare you the details. The point is that you can build your own devices for capturing digital data — something to consider before plunking down a few thousand dollars for a logic analyzer.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_9"><b class="calibre3">Tools for Design</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">The final set of tools to needed to round out any hacker’s collection is a set of electronic design tools for PC boards and FPGAs. The subject of PC board and FPGA design is discussed in the appendices, but it’s worth mentioning here that quality versions of these tools can be acquired for almost nothing. As a result, one can design and build a complete circuit board with sophisticated reconfigureable hardware components for less than the cost of an Xbox — including the cost of the design and construction tools.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PC board design used to be a very expensive proposition; tools would cost thousands of dollars and a simple board manufacturing run would cost a few hundred dollars. Today, a novice can have a simple board fabricated for a total less than seventy dollars. For PC board design tools, Altium, formerly called Protel, sells a tool called CircuitMaker2000. While I have not used CircuitMaker2000 extensively, my first impression is that it is very similar to Altium’s now discontinued Protel 99SE. Download a free 30-day demo or their free student version (with restrictions), which is perfect for a first design project, from http://www.circuitmaker.com. Once you’ve designed your first board using your free tool, you can fabricate it with a vendor such as Sierra Proto Express (http://www.sierraprotoexpress.com) for around 30 dollars per board as of this writing, with a two board minimum order. As you can see, price is no longer a serious barrier, and I encourage you to try building a project or two using your own custom printed circuit boards.</p>

  <div class="infobox">
    <h2 class="calibre1 sigil_not_in_toc"><b class="calibre3">Static Electricity: The Circuit Killer</b><br/></h2>

    <p class="calibre1">Static electricity, also known as Electro-Static Discharge (ESD), is the bane of integrated circuits. Modern ICs are particularly sensitive to ESD; a few volts is all that is required to destroy a naked transistor. Since you do not feel static electricity discharges until the hundred or thousand-volt range, you can destroy such devices without knowing it.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The good news is that most chips are built with special structures to help make them more resistant to ESD. Still, it is better not to voluntarily participate in testing them. In order to neutralize static electricity on your body, always touch a grounded metal ic object before touching a circuit board or a chip. The bare metal on the case of a computer that is plugged into a properly wired household outlet is a good starting point.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Wearing an antistatic wrist strap, available at almost any computer store, wil minimize the risk of damaging your Xbox with ESD. The wrist strap must be attached to a grounded object in order for it to be effective.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">If you feel like living on the edge, working with bare feet on an uncarpeted concrete floor will also keep you grounded. Bare concrete floors are surprisingly conductive, to the point where you can get a shock or burn from prolonged contact with electronic equipment plugged into improperly wired outlets. Linoleum and hardwood floors can also be effective grounding points, depending on the kind of tile or wax used on the floor. Special conductive waxes or sprays can be applied to insure that the floor is sufficiently conductive.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1">FPGAs — Field Programmable Gate Arrays — are the solution for inexpensive silicon prototyping. An FPGA consists of a large array of gates and storage elements with a programmable interconnect. As a result, FPGAs can implement all kinds of digital devices, limited only by the gate and wire capacity of the FPGA. Larger FPGAs, with a capacity of several million gates, can contain entire systems, complete with microprocessors and peripherals. FPGAs are also very affordable: a 100,000 gate Xilinx Spartan II FPGA costs around 20 dollars in single quantities. And better yet, you can get unrestricted design and synthesis environments for Xilinx FPGAs for <i class="calibre4">free</i>! Xilinx has a free product called the “ISE WebPack”, available from their website (www.xilinx.com), that includes features such as Verilog and VHDL synthesis, HDL testbench generation, and power-analysis software. Verilog is a C-like language for hardware design; one can think of it as a strictly typed, multi-threaded C. This is great news for software hackers who would like to dabble in hardware. There are even open-source hardware design communities, such as www.opencores.org, where you can download the code for microprocessors and other interesting digital components, again for free.</p>


  <h2 class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Deconstructing the Xbox</b><br/></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that we’ve discussed some of the tools you’ll need to hack, let’s do some hacking. The first step in hacking your Xbox is opening the box. Here are the tools you will need to take the cover off:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>T10 and T20 Torx bits (six-pointed star shaped bits)</li>

    <li>A screwdriver handle for the bits</li>

    <li>Antistatic safety gear (see “Static Electricity: The Circuit Killer”)</li>

    <li>Small flathead screwdriver (helpful, but not required)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Note</h3>

    <p><img alt="" class="note" src="../Images/index-40_1.png"/> Before you start taking apart your Xbox, keep a few things in mind: first, there is always some risk of permanent damage when taking things apart, and taking apart the Xbox voids your warranty. Second, be sure to read through the entire section before proceeding. And third, have fun.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="after-note" id="sigil_toc_id_10">Step 1: Safety First</h3>

  <p class="calibre1"><b>Unplug the Xbox. Leaving the Xbox plugged in will expose you to hazardous, possibly lethal, voltages.</b></p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_11"><b class="calibre3">Step 2: Remove Case Screws</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">Flip the Xbox upside-down and inspect the bottom. There are six screws that hold the top and bottom halves of the outer shell together, and they are all hidden underneath labels or the rubber feet. Figure 1-2 illustrates the position of all the screw locations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The rubber feet are glued onto the Xbox with a strong adhesive. Removing the feet will usually require a little bit of help from a flathead screwdriver. Figure 1-3 illustrates this procedure. Once you have pried up an edge of the rubber foot, peel it back as evenly as possible so as to preserve the adhesive backing on the foot. If you are careful, you will be able to re-attach the foot later on, although after a couple of removal cycles the adhesive will lose its tack. As a replacement, you can buy rubber feet at any hardware store and attach them if you use your Xbox on a surface that is slippery or sensitive to scratching.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Use the T20 size Torx bit to remove the four screws that were underneath the rubber feet. The screws are fairly long, but their threads are short so removal should be quick.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The last two screws are hidden underneath the serial number label and the product certification label. Figure 1-4 illustrates the location of these screws.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-41_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-3</b>: Use a small flathead screwdriver to pry up an edge of the Xbox’s rubber feet, then carefully peel them back.<br/></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In order to locate them, rub a finger firmly over the general region where the screws should be. The label will indent slightly over the screw holes. Puncture the label with the bit and slide or rotate the bit around until it catches in the screw hole, and proceed to remove the screw. If you care about the cosmetic integrity of the labels, hold the label down while you remove the screw, otherwise the label will peel back or tear.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Tip</h3>

    <p><b class="calibre3"><img alt="tip" src="../Images/tip.png"/>Keep a small tray or plastic bag around to store your screws so you don’t lose them. The screws that hold the Xbox together are fairly unique and you may find it difficult to purchase a suitable substitute at the local hardware store.</b></p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_12" style="clear: left;"><b class="calibre3">Step 3: Remove the Top Cover</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">You should have removed six identical long screws at this point. Turn the Xbox right side up, and gently grasp the box by the sides using the open palms of your hands, and attempt to lift the cover off with a gentle shake. If the cover does not come off with this method, you may need to “start” the cover by prying the case with your fingers from the back. In some rare cases, you will also have to pry with a screwdriver from the front, but be careful and gentle when you do this. Figure 1-5 illustrates some of the points you can use to help remove the case.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Do not force the case cover off. If the prying methods described above yield no progress on the case cover, an extra screw may have been added since the publication of this book. Attempt to locate the screw by feeling the labels on the back of the Xbox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-43_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-5</b>: Some places where you can pry to work open a stubborn cover.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_13"><b class="calibre3">Step 4: Move the Disk Drives</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that you’re inside, you should see two drives mounted on black plastic carriers. In order to access the motherboard, you will need to <i class="calibre4">move</i> (not necessarily remove) the disk drives. You do not have to disconnect the drive cables, but you will need to unscrew the drive carriers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Three T10 Torx screws hold down the carriers. Figure 1-6 illustrates the location of these screws. One is hidden underneath the gray IDE ribbon cable near the back of the case, and two are recessed about an inch below the surface of the drives near the front of the case. You may need a flashlight or direct overhead lighting to see the recessed screws.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The recessed screws may prove to be a bit challenging if your screw driver does not have a magnetized bit holder, as the bit will tend to slide out as you position it over the screw. The bit is also small enough so that it can engage the space between the screw and the plastic carrier. If the drive carriers remain stiff even though you think you have removed the screws, double-check to make sure they are actually unscrewed. You should be able to lift up the carriers slightly without undue force.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-44_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-6</b>: Location of the three drive carrier screws. Note that the gray IDE ribbon cable is being lifted for the photograph. The box on the left is the hard drive, and the box on the right is the DVD drive.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once you have removed the screws, you will need to free the hard drive power cable, or it will interfere with the removal of the drive carriers. The power cable is a black, yellow, and red bundle of wires to the outside of the hard drive. The hard drive is the device on the left in Figure 1-6. It is held in a notch along the edge of the carrier. Gently work the cable free of the notch so that there is a couple inches of slack on the cable. Figure 1-7 illustrates about how much slack you should have when you are done.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once the cable is free, you will be able to lift the hard drive out of its storage position. Lift the hard drive up and rest it over the DVD drive. With both hands, lift the DVD and hard drives out of the case, and fold them outward so they hang off to the side as shown in Figure 1-8. The cables connecting the drives should fold over easily with no resistance. (Be mindful of the yellow cable coming from the back of the DVD drive; it can be easily pulled out of its socket if you are not careful.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">You now have a ful view of the Xbox motherboard and power supply, without having disconnected any of the drives. This arrangement will be advantageous for testing the Xbox following any hardware modifications.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-45_1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-7</b>: Free the hard drive cable from its retaining notch. Once it is free, you should have a couple inches of slack on the cable.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-45_2.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"/></p>

  <p class="calibre1 caption"><b class="calibre3">Figure 1-8</b>: Position of the disk drives, preserving electrical connections for testing and experimentation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Always be mindful of the power supply; it has voltages that could</b> <b class="calibre3">injure or kill you if you touch it.</b> Remember that it is “live” as long as the Xbox is plugged in, even if the Xbox is turned off. Also note that the bottom of the hard drive carrier and the DVD drive have a secondary use as air ducting inside the Xbox. Running the Xbox with the drives off at the sides for extended periods of time could lead to your Xbox overheating. Likewise, be mindful of the large aluminum heat sinks on the CPU and the GPU. They can get unpleasantly hot — potentially hot enough to burn you — while the Xbox is operating.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the project in the next chapter (replacing the LED on the front panel of the Xbox), you will not need to disconnect the hard drives, although it is preferable that you do. This will prevent you from placing undue stresses on the cables when manipulating the Xbox’s case.</p>

  <h3 class="calibre1" id="sigil_toc_id_14"><b class="calibre3">Step 5: Remove the Disk Drives (Optional)</b></h3>

  <p class="calibre1">In many cases, you will find it more convenient and safer for your hardware to remove the disk drives entirely.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To do so, first unplug the gray IDE ribbon cable from the Xbox motherboard. Next, unplug the yellow discrete wire cable connected to the DVD drive from the motherboard. This yellow cable carries power to the DVD and communicates information about the state of the DVD drive’s tray to the motherboard. Do not yank on any single wire in the yellow discrete wire cable, or you could unseat a wire from the cable head. The preferred method of removing the cable is to grip it by the white connector and pull; however, if your fingers are not small enough to fit in the tight space, you can grip the entire bundle of wire and pull gently to remove the connector. Set the DVD drive aside.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Next, unplug the hard drive’s power connector. You will find that the connector is very firmly seated in the hard drive. If you simply pull on the connector directly, you risk injuring yourself on the sharp edges of the case when the connector comes free of the drive. To avoid injury, use a small flathead screwdriver to gently pry the connector off of the hard drive’s body, as shown in Figure 1-9.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">You can now remove the disk drive assembly entirely. The gray IDE ribbon cable will still span the separate drive units; you may remove them if you wish, but remember its orientation so you can later re-attach the drives to the Xbox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that you’ve taken the Xbox apart, skip to the next sections for some fun projects that you can try. When you are finished, read this section for notes on how to reassemble your Xbox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before attaching anything to the Xbox, turn it upside-down and shake it gently to ensure that there are no loose screws or parts that you might have accidentally dropped into the Xbox. A loose screw will spell the end of your video game console and presents a potential fire hazard, so this is a worthwhile check if you have any doubt in your mind.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The first step in reassembling your Xbox is to re-attach the disk drives. If you followed the procedure from the previous section, your DVD drive and your hard drive should already be attached by the gray IDE ribbon cable. If they are not, attach the end of the cable with the fewest creases to the hard drive, and then attach the middle connector of the cable to the DVD drive. The cables will only attach in one direction; pay attention to the bump on the connector and the position of the notch on the drive connectors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Plug the remaining free end of the gray IDE ribbon cable into the Xbox motherboard. The cable will only plug into the motherboard in one direction; note the bump in the middle of the IDE plug and the notch on the motherboard receptacle. Now, attach the yellow DVD cable to the Xbox motherboard. This cable also will plug into the motherboard connector in only one orientation, and it too has bumps on the cable and corresponding notches on the motherboard receptacle. Now, set the DVD drive into the Xbox. Check that it is flush and level by observing how the Xbox-logo DVD drive tray sits with respect to the edge of the case. It is likely that you will need to try to place the drive a couple of times before it sits just right. Use the creases in the gray IDE ribbon cable to help guide you if you are confused about the orientation of the various parts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">You’re almost done. Drop the hard drive into place next to the DVD drive. Again, this drive will probably require a bit of jiggling about in order to get it to settle into place. The drive should be level with the DVD drive and flush with the edges of the metal EMI radiation shieldaround the Xbox case. Thread the hard drive power cable through its retaining notch in the drive tray, and plug it into the hard drive. You will need to apply a fair bit of force on the connector to create a solid connection; you should feel a gentle snap when the connector is fully engaged. Finally, thread the gray IDE ribbon cable through its original retaining hook on the drive carriers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this point, it is a good idea to plug the Xbox in, connect it to a TV and check to make sure that the Xbox starts up properly. You can run the Xbox indefinitely with the cover off like this, as all of the cooling ducts formed by the bottom of the drive carriers and the DVD drive are in place. If the drives are not properly connected to the Xbox, the console will still boot, but it wil display a message that your console requires service. Check your connections carefully if this message appears.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is now time to screw the drives in place. You should have nine screws at this point: three short T10-drive screws for the drive carriers, and six long T20-drive screws for the case cover. Don’t panic if you are missing a couple of screws, or if you have a couple extra. The Xbox will still hold together even if you’re short a screw or two. Attach the screws and the case cover in the reverse order of removing them. (See the pictures earlier in this section if you need a reminder as to where they go.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once the case cover is attached, you are ready to use your Xbox again!</p>
