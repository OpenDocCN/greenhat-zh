- en: As a raster image editor, GIMP loves to play with points of color, both individually
    and in blocks and blobs grouped together in selections. This makes the program
    perfect for working with photographs. Both your digital camera and GIMP work with
    pixels, so no data conversion is required. The days of scanning your photos are
    a thing of the past.

    can perform. Going from average photos to studio-quality productions requires
    just a few techniques that anyone can learn to use. Many techniques are based
    on simple color corrections like those provided by the Curves, Levels, and Color
    Balance tools.

    tool (Colors▸Retinex), for example, normalizes colors in order to enhance focus.
    Originally produced by NASA’s Langley Research Center to enhance images taken
    through smoke and haze, this filter has interesting possibilities for portrait
    enhancement.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The soft-focus technique has long been used to soften hard edges between shadows
    and light, allowing a foreground image to fade into the background. This is especially
    true for studio portraits, where backgrounds are often just painted canvas. Blending
    foreground and background can pull the eye toward the foreground, if done correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In photography, the soft-focus effect originated as a result of flaws in camera
    lenses. Later, with the use of lens filters, the effect was often incorporated
    into glamour images because it smooths skin wrinkles. In the digital age, soft
    focus is a handy trick that can remove blemishes while adding charm to any image.
  prefs: []

    programs like GIMP now provide, using common processes such as blurring. But it

    pass filter lets high frequencies pass while blocking low frequencies. In an image,
    a high pass filter will enhance the areas of greatest contrast. You can use this
    knowledge to find blemishes, blur them out, and blend with the original image.

    with antique photos. This may be because more old sepia-toned photos have survived.
    The processing chemistry for sepia prints converts the silver metal, which forms
    the image in black-and-white prints, into silver sulfide. Silver sulfide is more
    stable than silver metal. Thus, converting the silver to sulfide gives the photographs
    a much longer shelf life.

    process, which resemble the ink of the cuttlefish (*sepia* in Latin). Re-creating
    true sepia tones digitally therefore limits us to a small set of dark brown colors,
    some with a slight tint of red. Similar processes could be applied using colors
    other than shades of brown, though the resulting images would not mimic true sepia
    prints.

    removing the log from the selection using any of the selection tools, including

    has heavy yellow content and needs to be handled in a similar manner (unless you

    However, this method is only appropriate for minor cleanup work such as removing
    specks of dust or hiding thin, short scratches. Cloning is also destructive because
    it occurs in the layer where the damage exists. If the patches are not to your
    liking, you may not be able to reverse them easily.

    and paste the selection as a patch layer, and then blend this into the original
    layer using the Airbrush tool in a layer mask. This approach has the advantage
    of allowing additional changes to be made later, by either modifying the layer
    mask or replacing the patch layer completely. Of course, no matter which approach
    you take, you’ll want to preserve your original damaged art for experimentation.
    In this tutorial, we’ll look at the copy-and-paste method of fixing heavily damaged
    images. We’ll also discuss when to use large selections to patch large areas and
    when to divide a blemish into pieces and patch them individually.

    high-speed flight.
