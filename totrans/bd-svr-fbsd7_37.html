<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis1"><a name="NTP " class="calibre8" id="NTP "/>NTP (Network Time Protocol)</span><a name="Internet protocol" class="calibre8" id="Internet protocol"/> is an Internet protocol used for synchronizing the clocks of networked computers. Computer clock accuracy is instrumental in providing a consistent reference for system log files, email timestamps, time-activated scripts, and so on. The NTP system is capable of keeping your computer's clock accurate to within a few milliseconds of an accurate time server. Time servers are usually connected directly to a source of accurate time (e.g., atomic or GPS clocks).<a name="IDX-CHP-15-0226" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-15-0226"/><a name="IDX-CHP-15-0227" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-15-0227"/><a name="IDX-CHP-15-0228" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-15-0228"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="a hierarchy" class="calibre8" id="a hierarchy"/>The NTP system consists of a hierarchy, or <span class="docEmphasis1">strata</span><a name="and private" class="calibre8" id="and private"/>, of public and private servers. A <span class="docEmphasis1">stratum 1</span><a name="clock with" class="calibre8" id="clock with"/> server synchronizes its clock with an accurate external GPS (Global Positioning System) clock, radio clock, or other highly accurate time-keeping device. A <span class="docEmphasis1">stratum 2</span><a name="more stratum" class="calibre8" id="more stratum"/> server derives its clock data from one or more stratum 1 servers, a <span class="docEmphasis1">stratum 3</span><a name="or more" class="calibre8" id="or more"/> server derives its clock data from one or more stratum 2 servers, and so on. Servers at the lower stratum levels (numerically speaking) are not necessarily more accurate. The accuracy of the time source, geographic location, and network latency all contribute to the accuracy of a time server.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="to one" class="calibre8" id="to one"/>A server running the NTP daemon periodically synchronizes its clock to one or more established time servers. Over time, the NTP daemon calculates the system-specific clock error. If the system temporarily loses Internet connectivity, the NTP daemon will keep the system clock accurate using this error (or <span class="docEmphasis1">clock drift</span>) data until it can re-synchronize with a time server.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="originally developed" class="calibre8" id="originally developed"/>David Mills, a professor at the University of Delaware, originally developed NTP in the early '80s. NTP was initially named the Internet Clock Service and was created to provide clock synchronization for the HELLO routing protocol. These early versions of NTP were less accurate than today's because they did not have any frequency correction abilities. Mills, along with a team of volunteers, continues to develop NTP.<a name="IDX-CHP-15-0229" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-15-0229"/></p>
