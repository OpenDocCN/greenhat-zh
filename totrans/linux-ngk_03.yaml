    users to deal with, we will focus on it almost exclusively in this book.'

    GNOME, let me assure you that you are not. You can run any KDE application from
    within GNOME, and vice versa. In fact, once you have a look at the Main menu,
    you will see that there are many KDE applications (*apps,* for short) listed in
    the various submenus. Most apps beginning with a *K* are KDE apps, such as the
    KAtomic and KBounce games, and the KPPP Internet dialer, which I will discuss
    in Chapter If you followed my directions in [Chapter 2](DDU0018_split_000.html#42),

    enough to be interesting. There are three main elements that you will probably
    notice right off the bat: the desktop icons, the GNOME Panel at the bottom of

    I will focus on these elements in this chapter.'

    files, Nautilus displays thumbnails of the files (as shown in [Figure 3-3](#figure.DDU15))
    along with the filenames. This lets you see your graphics files without having
    to use any other special imaging software. Admittedly, this feature is no longer
    unique in the world of operating systems, but it is handy nonetheless.

    the file in the GIMP — the Linux world’s answer to Photoshop (more about using
    the GIMP later in this chapter and in [Chapter 14](DDU0102_split_000.html#622)).
    With the GIMP, you can, among other things, change the size of the image, adjust
    the color balance, brightness, and contrast, convert the image from one format
    to another (from .jpg to .png, for example), airbrush in a beauty mark on your
    cheek, and even stamp little green peppers all over your head. All very cool indeed.

    its left side, with your username emblazoned upon it. In addition to your username,
    the side pane also shows how many files and subfolders you have in the folder
    you are currently viewing, and when you last added or deleted any files or subfolders
    in that folder. If that isn’t enough to get your blood flowing, there’s more.

    menu, a folder tree of your entire hard-disk layout will appear within the pane
    (see [Figure 3-5](#figure.DDU17)). You can click on any folder in the tree, and

    but why on earth would you want to create bookmarks within your file system? Well,
    imagine that you have a folder that you need to use often, but it takes an excessive
    number of mouse clicks to get to that folder, and all that clicking is giving
    you a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Instead of maiming yourself in that
    way, you could click your way to that folder once, and then, in the **Bookmarks**
    menu of the Nautilus window, select **Add Bookmark**. After that, whenever you
    want to get back to that well-buried folder, you can just click the Bookmarks
    menu, and that folder will be right there waiting for you in the drop- down list

    with a pencil in the middle of it (meaning that you do not have permission to
    alter that file). This is another way that Linux tries to protect you, though

    the files until you change the permissions for them. You will also eventually
    find, especially when you try to change system settings or install additional

    virtual desktops. Instead of viewing just one desktop, as in most operating systems,
    you can view and work in up to 100 discrete desktops, and you can switch between
    them with the Workspace Switcher. As things are, your Workspace Switcher should
    show four squares, each representing one desktop. This makes the icon a bit wide,
    and it takes up a bit too much space on your Panel. Because you are most likely
    new to the idea of virtual desktops, I think that two should be enough to play
    with for now — at least until you find out a bit more about them later in the
    chapter.

    drawer is a little pop-up panel that acts as the perfect location to place launchers
    that you do not want to place in your GNOME Panel because of space considerations
    and that do not appear in the Main menu and therefore must be run by command.
    Launchers of this sort are useful for quickly opening most of the programs that
    you compile from source code and also for several KDE programs. Of course, you
    can put anything you want there, including frequently used files.
