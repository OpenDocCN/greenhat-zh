    you have already made the commitment and have Fedora Core installed on your machine,
    then you are essentially ready to go. Others of you might have made the commitment
    psychologically, but have yet to install anything on your computer. And some of
    you are probably reading these words in the aisle of a bookstore, wondering about
    Linux and about whether you should spend your money on this book or on a latté
    every morning for the next couple of weeks. For those in this last group, I can
    only say, “Get this book.” Save the wear and tear on your stomach and nerves.

    Fedora Core thing is all about, why you might want to install and use it, and
    what you will need in order to do so. I expect you will have lots of questions
    along the way, and if you are like most people, a few doubts. I hope that by the
    time you finish this book and have your Linux system up and running, your doubts
    will be gone and your questions, for the most part, will be answered. For the
    time being, just relax, don’t worry, and go with the flow.

- en: Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is
    really just . . . well, a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own,
    it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk or two. In order
    for it to do anything else, it needs an operating system (OS) to guide it. The
    OS takes an essentially well-endowed but completely uneducated hunk of a machine
    and educates it, at least enough so that it will understand what you want it to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You already know of, and have probably used at least one of the many operating
    systems that exist today. Windows, DOS, and the Mac OS are all such operating
    systems, and Linux is yet another. Linux is, however, different from these other
    operating systems, both in terms of its capabilities and its heritage. Linux was
    not created by a corporation or by some corporate wanna-bes out to make money.
    It was instead created by a Swedish computer enthusiast living in Finland, Linus
    Torvalds, who wanted to create a better Unix-like system that would work on home
    computers, particularly his. Rather than keeping his creation to himself, Torvalds
    opened it up to the world, so to speak, and the system was then expanded and improved
    on by compu-geeks around the globe who worked to make the system better and more
    powerful.

    devotees praise Linux for its many features, as well as for its being robust,
    reliable, free, and open. Despite these positive characteristics, however, Linux
    is, on its own, just a text-based system. There is no pretty desktop, and there
    are no windows or charming little icons to make you feel safe and comfy once you
    are behind the keyboard. Powerful though it may be, Linux is still strictly a
    black- screen, command-line-driven operating system. I guess you could think of
    it as DOS on steroids, though a Linux purist will surely cringe at the thought.
    Sorry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you can use Linux by itself, accomplishing all your tasks by typing
    in commands on a black screen, you don’t have to. It is fair to say that with
    the advent of the Macintosh and its easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI,
    pronounced goo-ee) in 1984, users of other operating systems began suffering something
    akin to GUI envy. They began clamoring for a GUI to call their own, and Windows,
    which gave DOS a GUI, eased many command-wary users into the Microsoft world.

    and various software mechanisms were developed by the community at large to bring
    about the change. The graphical desktop environments that are included in your
    Fedora Core distribution, GNOME and KDE, are examples of the fruit of that development.

    (see [Figure 1-1](#figure.DDU0)). This explains not only the ornithological references
    and graphics throughout the book, but also why there are so many penguin icons
    in Linux distributions and so many programs that include “penguin” or “Tux,” like
    TuxRacer, XPenguins, and Pingus. This also explains why Linux users are sometimes
    referred to as Penguinistas.

    stability, multilingual capabilities, or even personal philosophy. However, for
    many others, crass as it may sound, it is a matter of money. Just think for a
    moment about what it costs to get started up with another operating system. Go
    to wherever it is you go to buy software, and take a walk down the aisles. Make
    a list in your head of all the things you want to buy and how much each costs:
    an office suite, a game or two, and maybe a graphics program with which to make
    yourself look better in your digital photos. Now do the math.'

    many people have, making the move to Linux means not only savings for you, but
    also more computing versatility — you will not be hamstrung at some point along
    the way because you don’t have this or that program when you need it most — you’ll
    have it all from the get-go!

    out there for other operating systems, but c’mon, let’s face it, these are often
    rather limited in terms of their capabilities. The programs with a little more
    oomph are mostly shareware, and most shareware programs these days are limited
    in some way, or they only let you use them for a month or less, unless you are
    willing to pay for them. Sure, their costs are relatively low, but $25 here and
    $35 there eventually adds up to a considerable chunk of change. In addition, at
    least in my experience, the majority of such programs are hardly worth the money
    asked. The only shareware program I ever found worth buying was Lemke Software’s
    GraphicConverter for the Mac.

    system for a month without restarting occasionally and see what happens. Linux

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lot of different
    functions. And because there is no Linux Corporation to package and distribute
    the files that make up Linux, the task of getting Linux onto your computer in
    working order, along with the applications that you are likely to want, has fallen
    to a varied group of entities — companies, universities, user groups, and even
    private individuals. The Linux system and application collections they create
    are called *distributions*, or *distros*. You could bypass such distros and try
    to collect everything you’d need to set up a system all on your own, but you would
    undoubtedly lose your mind in the process. Most people, even the geekiest, opt
    for the distros.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The majority of these distros, whatever their ultimate target audience, basically
    consist of the same main elements: the Linux kernel itself, some sort of installer
    program to get all the system parts and applications properly installed on your
    machine, the X Window System to provide graphical interface support, one or more
    graphical desktop environments, and then a series of applications, such as word
    processors, audio players, games, and all the other files needed to make these
    things work.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are, of course, a large number of distros. Some are geared to a specific
    audience, such as businesses, educators, gamers, students, programmers, system
    administrators, and specific language users. What makes each distro different
    is the specific software that is bundled with the Linux kernel, as well as other
    convenience features, such as the installer. Some distros are especially appropriate
    for home users due to their ease of installation. Mandrake, SuSE, and Fedora/Red
    Hat Linux are probably the three most popular in this regard, with Fedora/Red
    Hat Linux being cited as having the most users in the American market. While many
    of these entities charge for their distros, most also provide them free for download.

    consumer product for personal desktops and workstations (Red Hat Linux 8 and 9,
    for example), and a separate product for corporate users (Red Hat Enterprise Edition).
    The corporate product is and always has been Red Hat’s cash cow, as companies
    pay for the system on a subscription basis along with various support services.
    The consumer version, despite its great popularity, was essentially a money loser
    because most users would just download it for free, rather than buy it.'
  prefs: []

    and sell the consumer product as a boxed item, and instead set it off as a semi-
    autonomous unit under the Red Hat umbrella called the Red Hat Linux Project. The
    new project would continue producing the consumer version, but as a totally free
    product developed by the project with Linux community involvement. Most saw this
    as a positive move, as it would allow greater input into and more rapid development
    of the distribution. Work then progressed on what most people were then calling
    Red Hat Linux 10.

    began on a merger between that project and another completely separate community
    project, the Fedora Linux Project. The Fedora Linux Project, rather than building
    a distribution of its own, worked to prepare application packages (RPMs) for use
    with Red Hat Linux. As the goals of the two projects were overlapping, the two
    projects merged. The result is the Fedora Project, which is still under the Red
    Hat umbrella. Rather than continue using the name Red Hat Linux, however, the
    Fedora Project opted to use the more all-encompassing name *Fedora Core* as the
    name of its distribution.

    Core, as it retains the look, feel, and functionality of Red Hat Linux 9\. To

    processor (CPU), and monitor you have if you want to be able to find out anything
    of value. Identifying your CPU and monitor should be easy enough, but the motherboard
    may require a bit more searching. If you have no documentation that clearly states
    what kind of motherboard you have, then just open up the case of your computer
    and look at your board. You needn’t worry about damaging something because you
    don’t need to touch anything (so don’t). You may need a flashlight to find it,
    but the model name and number should be stamped on there somewhere, either in
    the middle of the board or around the edges. Mine, for example, says quite clearly

    This underestimation doesn’t mean that the folks at the Fedora Project are trying
    to sucker you. It is just one of those OS things. The fact is that no matter what
    OS you are dealing with, whether it be Windows or Macintosh or Linux, whatever
    they tell you is enough memory is sure to be too little. My basic rule of thumb,
    no matter what OS I am dealing with, is that you need the recommended (not the
