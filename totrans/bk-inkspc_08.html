The way an object in an Inkscape document looks is determined by that object’s <span class="emphasis"><em>style</em></span>, consisting of separate <span class="emphasis"><em>properties</em></span>. Mastering the program is impossible without familiarity with the available style properties and the tools for editing them.</p><p>In this chapter, we will look at the most basic style properties, including the common types of <span class="emphasis"><em>paint</em></span> (fill and stroke) and opacity. This will be followed by <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Stroke and Markers">Chapter 9</a> covering stroke style, <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Gradients and Patterns">Chapter 10</a> where we’ll look in detail at gradients and patterns, and <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Text">Chapter 15</a> where we’ll explore text style properties.

If you’re using Inkscape for anything practical, you’re likely already using at least some of them. Instead of discussing these UI elements one by one, we will start by looking at the general style concepts and specific properties, examining the corresponding tools when they are relevant.</p><p><a id="iddle1503" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1548" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1608" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1742" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2134" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2141" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2145" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2146" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2149" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2154" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2162" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2168" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2180" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2384" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2387" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3084" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3268" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3411" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3412" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4032" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4382" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4388" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4389" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4391" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4399" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4423" class="indexterm"/>One style-related command you should know up front is <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Style</strong></span> (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00333"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735400.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>).

Just like filters (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Filters">Chapter 17</a>), opacity applies to the entire object without any distinction between fill and stroke.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the above is only true for the master opacity of an object. In SVG objects can have three kinds of opacity: <span class="emphasis"><em>master opacity</em></span> (which is called simply <span class="emphasis"><em>opacity</em></span> in most places in the UI as well as in this book), <span class="emphasis"><em>fill opacity</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>stroke opacity</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch08s01.html#fill_opacitycomma_stroke_opacitycomma_an" title="Figure 8-3. Fill opacity, stroke opacity, and master opacity">Figure 8-3</a>). The two latter kinds apply only to fill or stroke, respectively, and while Inkscape allows you to view and change them, it generally discourages them in favor of master opacity. Situations where you might need your stroke opaque but fill transparent or vice versa are not too frequent in practice, and in all other cases master opacity is a lot more natural and easier to use.</p><p>One consequence of using stroke opacity is that you can see the fringe of the object’s fill, normally obscured by its own stroke. Per SVG rules, stroke is always drawn on top of fill in the object’s own internal z-order, and fill is bounded by the midline of the stroke, so with a semitransparent stroke you will see three distinct boundaries: the outer boundary of the stroke, the stroke’s midline where its fill starts, and the inner boundary of the stroke where it overlaps the fill.</p><p>Master opacity, unlike stroke opacity, has no such problems—it applies to the object as a whole, without revealing any untidy fringe. In the same way, when applied to a group, it makes the group transparent as a whole, which is often different from the same level of opacity assigned to individual objects in the group (see <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html#group_transparency" title="Figure 4-6. Group transparency">Figure 4-6</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="fill_opacitycomma_stroke_opacitycomma_an"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00099"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735696.png.jpg" alt="Fill opacity, stroke opacity, and master opacity"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-3. Fill opacity, stroke opacity, and master opacity</p></div><p><a id="iddle1294" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1464" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1536" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1600" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1610" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1621" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1636" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3725" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4501" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4771" class="indexterm"/>Also, unlike fill or stroke opacity, master opacity is applicable to objects that cannot have fill or stroke of their own, such as bitmaps and most clones.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08note03"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>What is the difference between</em></span> opacity <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> transparency<span class="emphasis"><em>?

<div class="sect1" title="8.2 Color Models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="eightdot2_color_models"/>8.2 Color Models</h1></div></div></div><p>The most basic and the most important building block of style is <span class="emphasis"><em>color</em></span>. A discussion of representing color on the computer could easily fill a book; while Inkscape is not yet the most powerful program for working with color, it is still quite rich and complex in this area.</p><p>The first choice you will face is between <span class="emphasis"><em>color models</em></span>. The same color can be represented differently by different color models.</p><div class="sect2" title="8.2.1 RGB"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="eightdot2dot1_rgb"/>8.2.1 RGB</h2></div></div></div><p>You probably already know the most common color model, <span class="emphasis"><em>RGB</em></span>, in which any color is represented as a mix of red, green, and blue components, or <span class="emphasis"><em>channels</em></span>. This model is implemented by nearly all computer displays (which are typically composed of tiny light sources of these three colors) and is the primary color model used in SVG as well as most other computer graphic formats.</p><p>Depending on which software you use, the value of each of the three channels in an RGB color may be either a fractional number between 0 and 1 (such as 0.5) or an integer between 0 and 255 (such as 127). These two systems are equivalent; for example, a color with R = 0, G = 0.5, B = 1.0 is the same as R = 0, G = 127, B = 255. Inkscape normally uses the 0-to-255 integer format, which we will also prefer in this book. (However, in some parts of the Inkscape UI, you will see a choice to use either the integer or the fractional format.)</p><p>In RGB, higher values of the channels make the color lighter and lower values make it darker. Thus, RGB 0/0/0 is black and RGB 255/255/255 is white. Any RGB color where the values of all channels are equal is a shade of gray; making the channels unequal adds saturation to the color, and the bigger the <a id="iddle1492" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1561" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1598" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1604" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1690" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2179" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2318" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2591" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3254" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3591" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3599" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3912" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3917" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4033" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4048" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4502" class="indexterm"/>inequality, the greater the saturation. Thus, pure colors such as red (RGB 255/0/0) or yellow (RGB 255/255/0) have maximum possible saturation.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog lets you edit colors in RGB using either numeric input fields (with scroll buttons) or sliders that move within graduated-color grooves (see Figure 2 on the color insert). Note that the colors of the grooves change as you move the sliders; each groove shows you the the colors that you will get by moving the slider within it if the other sliders remain where they are. The fourth slider at the bottom, labeled <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> (alpha), represents the fill or stroke opacity (and thus is not, strictly speaking, part of the color).</p><p>An RGB color is often expressed as a string of the form <code class="literal">RRGGBB</code> where each of the three components is given by a two-digit hexadecimal (base 16, instead of the conventional base 10) number. Hexadecimal numbers can use digits <code class="literal">0</code> through <code class="literal">9</code> and letters <code class="literal">A</code> through <code class="literal">F</code>. The maximum integer value of a channel—<code class="literal">255</code> in decimal—is represented as <code class="literal">FF</code> in hexadecimal. So, for example, <code class="literal">000000</code> is black, <code class="literal">FFFFFF</code> is white, <code class="literal">660000</code> is dark red. This form of representing colors is used in the SVG source of Inkscape documents, as well as in a lot of other software and languages (such as HTML). When you choose <span class="strong"><strong>Copy color</strong></span> from the right-click menu of the fill or stroke swatch in the selected style indicator (<a class="xref" href="ch08s01.html#paint_types_in_the_selected_stroke_indic" title="Figure 8-1. Paint types in the selected stroke indicator (left) and the Fill and Stroke dialog (right)">Figure 8-1</a>), the <code class="literal">RRGGBB</code> representation of the color is copied to the clipboard. Also, a <code class="literal">RRGGBBAA</code> representation (with two more digits appended representing fill/stroke opacity) can be viewed and edited in the <span class="strong"><strong>RGBA</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog.</p><p>If multiple objects are selected and they have different fill or stroke colors, both the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog and the selected style indicator display the <span class="emphasis"><em>averaged color</em></span>.

This color model is best suited for printed output because many professional printers and printing presses use CMYK.

For this reason, Inkscape usually gives preference to another color model: <span class="emphasis"><em>HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)</em></span>. Unlike RGB and CMYK, the channels of HSL are not individual colors that you mix together; rather, they are the properties of the color which, together, define it unambiguously.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>hue</em></span> channel is the rainbow of maximum saturation colors, starting from red and going through yellow, green, blue, and back to red. <span class="emphasis"><em>Saturation</em></span> varies the color in the range from maximum colorfulness, through drab and dull, to the pure gray of the same brightness level. Finally, the <span class="emphasis"><em>lightness</em></span> channel goes from black to the given color and then to white. (This means any color with maximum lightness is white and any color with zero lightness is black, regardless of the hue and saturation.)</p><p>A similar color model you might have seen in other programs is <span class="emphasis"><em>HSV (hue, saturation, value)</em></span>, sometimes also called <span class="emphasis"><em>HSB (hue, saturation, brightness)</em></span>. Its most visible difference from HSL is that in HSV, the Value component changes only from black to the given color (e.g., red). In HSL, the Lightness component ranges all the way from black through the given color to white (i.e., it is symmetrical with regard to lightness and darkness).</p><p>The HSL color model, once you get used to it, is very natural. When you think that some color is not quite right, for example, you are likely to suggest making it “lighter” or “less saturated” rather than “add more green” to it. Therefore, most color-related tools in Inkscape use HSL for choosing and changing colors.</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog, there are two different tabs that let you edit color in the HSL model (see Figure 4 on the color insert). The first one (titled <span class="strong"><strong>HSL</strong></span>) uses traditional linear sliders, whereas the other one (titled <span class="strong"><strong>Wheel</strong></span>) has a circular ring for the H channel (which has a better resolution simply because, if straightened, it would be longer than a linear slider fitting into the window) and a triangle that encodes the saturation and lightness channels. Rotating the mark on the hue ring rotates the triangle too, so that its maximum-saturation tip always points to the current hue on the ring.</p></div></div>

Simply clicking assigns fill color to the selected objects; <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00336"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-clicking assigns stroke color. The leftmost button on the palette <span class="emphasis"><em>removes</em></span> fill or (with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00337"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>) stroke.</p><p>Apart from clicking, you can drag and drop colors from the palette onto objects. This is one of the very few ways to change objects without selecting them; if you drop a color on some object, that object will change, even if it is not selected and even if some other object is selected. Dropping also works for changing stroke color, for which you need to drop the color swatch precisely onto the outline of a path or shape.</p><p>Inkscape does not yet allow you to edit the color swatches or add new swatches to the palette via the UI. However, you can choose one of the many different palettes that are included with Inkscape. On the right end of the palette, there’s a button with a triangle mark; clicking it opens a menu listing available palettes, such as a web-safe palette, palettes used by Ubuntu and Windows for their UI, and various monochrome palettes (greens, golds, and so on). Inkscape will remember your choice of palette.</p><p>In the same menu, you can choose one of the standard <span class="emphasis"><em>sizes</em></span> of the swatches, their <span class="emphasis"><em>width</em></span> (narrow swatches are harder to click but may get rid of the palette’s scrollbar by fitting the entire palette into your screen width), as well as enable the palette to <span class="emphasis"><em>wrap around</em></span> (this makes it taller but also gets rid of the scrollbar).</p><p>Along with the docked horizontal palette, Inkscape has the <span class="strong"><strong>Swatches</strong></span> dialog (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00338"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735700.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>). It can show all the same palettes and has all the same size options, except that it has an additional <span class="strong"><strong>List</strong></span> option where it lists all the colors along with their names. You might prefer it to the palette because as a dialog, it can be placed in the dock on the right and squeezed there into a narrow vertical strip.</p><div class="figure"><a id="palette_menu_left_parenthesisleftright_p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00101"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735702.png.jpg" alt="The Palette menu (left) and the Swatches dialog (right) in the List format showing colors with their names"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-5. The Palette menu (left) and the Swatches dialog (right) in the List format showing colors with their names</p></div><p><a id="iddle1619" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1620" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2174" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2299" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2623" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3918" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4888" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4938" class="indexterm"/>You can edit your Inkscape palettes as well as add new ones. Each palette is a text file that can be edited by hand. On Unix, the palettes which ship with Inkscape are located relative to Inkscape’s installation prefix, in the <span class="emphasis"><em>palettes</em></span> directory (often <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/share/inkscape/palettes</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/share/inkscape/palettes</em></span> if you compiled Inkscape yourself). Custom palettes can be placed in <span class="emphasis"><em>~/.config/inkscape/palettes</em></span>; you will need to create this directory if it does not exist. On Windows, palettes are located in <span class="emphasis"><em>share\palettes</em></span> inside the Inkscape installation directory (usually under <span class="emphasis"><em>Program Files\Inkscape</em></span>).</p><p>Inkscape borrowed the format of its palette files from the GIMP raster editor, so you can drop any palettes from a GIMP distribution into that directory to use them in Inkscape. Here’s the beginning of the default palette file, <span class="emphasis"><em>inkscape.gpl</em></span>; the color components (R, G, B) are in the 0..255 format:</p><a id="pro_id00002"/><pre class="programlisting">GIMP Palette

Note that this only works when the swatch displays a <span class="emphasis"><em>flat color</em></span>; it does not work for a swatch showing <span class="emphasis"><em>None</em></span> (i.e., no paint), <span class="emphasis"><em>N/A</em></span> (i.e., nothing is selected), or displaying a gradient (although you can select one or more gradient stops in the Gradient tool and color-adjust them by color gestures just as you would with objects).</p><p><a id="iddle2504" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2507" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2789" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3806" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4323" class="indexterm"/>Color gestures work in the HSL color space. Dragging without any keyboard modifiers adjusts the hue channel, dragging with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00339"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> adjusts saturation, and dragging with <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00340"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> adjusts lightness.</p><p>The adjustment is done by “rotating” the color swatch away from the original direction, which is assumed to be 45 degrees to the northeast, that is, from the swatch diagonally into the document window. Once you click and drag the color swatch, imagine a diagonal line going from the point where you clicked in the northeast direction, across the entire Inkscape window. By dragging <span class="emphasis"><em>below</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>to the right</em></span> of that line, you <span class="emphasis"><em>decrease</em></span> the corresponding color channel, down to the minimum at the lower edge of the window; by dragging it <span class="emphasis"><em>above</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>to the left</em></span>, you <span class="emphasis"><em>increase</em></span> it, up to the maximum at the left edge of the window. If you hover your mouse exactly over the 45-degree line, the change will be zero.</p><p>The mouse cursor changes when you’re doing color gestures, reflecting the channel currently being adjusted, and indicating the directions for increasing and decreasing the value. Also, watch the status bar, which will indicate, as you drag, the channel you are adjusting, the original value of that channel, the new value, and the difference.</p><p>The angular nature of this adjustment means that you can easily vary the precision of the change. If you drag close enough to the swatch, any small movement results in a big change of the color. If you need a finer adjustment, just drag farther away from the swatch, toward the center of the Inkscape window or even to its upper-right corner, where the same movements will produce very small changes in the color.</p><p>You can switch channels while you drag—that is, you don’t need to drag from the swatch again and again if you want to adjust all three channels. You can do it all in one drag, by pressing and releasing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00341"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00342"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> as necessary. Note that when you change the keyboard modifiers during drag, the zero-change line is temporarily rotated to go through the current mouse position; this is done so that there are no sudden changes in color if you are switching modifiers away from the original 45-degree line.</p><p>The <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00343"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> modifier is special. Pressing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00344"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> means “do nothing”; this allows you to move the mouse, without releasing, to a more convenient place from which you can continue tweaking the color after letting go of <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00345"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. As with the other modifiers, releasing <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00346"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> temporarily redefines the zero-change axis to go through the point where <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00347"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> was released. For example, imagine you made your color darker by <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00348"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-dragging toward the bottom edge of the window, and you now need to make it less saturated. You cannot, however, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00349"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag it any lower because there’s not enough room for that. In that situation, without releasing the mouse, <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00350"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag it upward to a convenient spot and then <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00351"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>-drag downward as needed. Also, you can start dragging from the swatch while holding down <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00352"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735550.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> to avoid any change of the color until you take a more convenient position for adjusting it.</p><p>For example, you can select a green rectangle and first turn it into a greenish-blue color by dragging away from the fill swatch and slightly above the 45-degree line; then, without releasing the mouse, press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00353"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> and drag a bit to the right to darken the color; then press <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00354"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735338.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, release <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00355"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735328.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, and adjust saturation.

If you adjust that color by gesturing, the changed color will be assigned back to all selected objects or stops, in effect eliminating any difference between them. If you want to adjust many different-colored objects preserving their relative differences, use the color modes of the Tweak tool (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html" title="8.7 Color Tweaking">8.7 Color Tweaking</a></strong></span>), color adjustment extensions (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08s08.html" title="8.8 Color Extensions and Filters">8.8 Color Extensions and Filters</a></strong></span>), or color filters (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch17s03.html" title="17.3 Preset Filters">17.3 Preset Filters</a></strong></span>).</p></div>

With this tool, you can use your own drawing as a palette, easily reusing colors you have once created for something else. It is also indispensable when you need to combine and blend vector objects with an imported bitmap.</p><p>The important thing about this tool is that when picking colors, it pays no attention to what <span class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span> you click; instead, it simply takes the color of the clicked <span class="emphasis"><em>pixel</em></span> in the rendered screen image.

This also means that if an object is too small to be rendered at the current zoom, you can’t pick its color, and that if you click the edge of a black object on white background, chances are you’ll pick a midrange gray color of the antialiasing pixel in that point (see <a class="xref" href="ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr" title="Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)">Figure 1-1</a>).</p><div class="sect2" title="8.6.1 Sampling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="eightdot6dot1_sampling"/>8.6.1 Sampling</h2></div></div></div><p>When you switch to the Dropper tool (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00362"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735704.png.jpg" alt=""/></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00363"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1735706.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>), the status bar starts to report the color located directly under the cursor.

The color being used—more precisely, the <span class="emphasis"><em>style</em></span> because it includes both fill and stroke—can be seen in the style swatch at the right end of the tool’s controls bar (above the canvas). To change this applied style, simply click the color palette or use any other style editing command (such as the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog) while you are in this mode of the Tweak tool.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08note08"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Unlike all other tools, in the Tweak tool in Color Paint mode you cannot assign style directly to selected objects; any style-setting commands are “intercepted” to change the tool’s style instead.</em></span></p></div><p>The fill from the tool’s style applies to the fills of the painted objects, and the stroke applies to the strokes. If the tool’s style has no fill or no stroke, it won’t affect fills or strokes, correspondingly. For example, if you want to color the fills of objects blue but leave their strokes untouched, assign blue fill to the tool’s <a id="iddle1629" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3616" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3925" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4537" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4552" class="indexterm"/>style (just click blue on the palette) but set its stroke to <code class="literal">none</code> (middle-click the <span class="strong"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> swatch in the status bar).</p><p>This mode literally paints on objects, <span class="emphasis"><em>gradually</em></span> shifting their colors toward the target color.

They allow you to turn on and off the tool’s action on the object’s hue, saturation, lightness, and opacity, correspondingly.</p><p>For example, if you want to raise the saturation of some part of your drawing without changing the hue, select some maximum-saturation color (such as pure red) and turn off all <span class="strong"><strong>Channels</strong></span> buttons except <span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span>. Similarly, you can replace the hues without affecting saturation or lightness (with only <span class="strong"><strong>H</strong></span> turned on), or lighten/darken all colors without changing their hues and saturations (only <span class="strong"><strong>L</strong></span> turned on). Enabling <span class="strong"><strong>O</strong></span> applies the master opacity from the tool’s style to the master opacity of objects (but not fill or stroke opacity).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8.7.4 Usage Notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="eightdot7dot4_usage_notes"/>8.7.4 Usage Notes</h2></div></div></div><p>Color painting is quite similar to a soft brush in a raster editor (such as the GIMP or Photoshop). However, even though the tool itself works as a brush, it still applies its color to vector objects, which behave as vector objects usually do. For example, if you want to change the tint of the face in your drawing, and if a hand in the drawing is part of the same path object as the face, that hand will change its tint too, even if it’s located far from the point you are painting. Still, even with this limitation, color painting allows you to quickly and intuitively make adjustments which would be awkward and slow with traditional vector tools.</p><p>Drawings containing patterns or scatterings of small independent objects are especially suitable for color painting with the Tweak tool. Examples include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Freehand drawings with the Calligraphic pen, consisting of many separate strokes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Gradient meshes imported from Adobe Illustrator’s AI files (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="apbs06.html" title="B.6 AI (Import)">B.6 AI (Import)</a></strong></span>), which Inkscape renders as lattices of small polygons. While there’s no direct support for gradient meshes in Inkscape yet, color painting on such lattices is nearly as good.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Text converted to paths, where each letter is a separate path (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15s07.html" title="15.7 Converting Text to Path">15.7 Converting Text to Path</a></strong></span>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Patterns made with the clone tiler (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16s06.html" title="16.6 Tiling Clones">16.6 Tiling Clones</a></strong></span>). Note that you need to unset the fill and/or stroke on the original object and use the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Tiled Clones</strong></span> dialog to assign some initial color to the clones—this will make them paintable with the Tweak tool without unlinking.</p></li></ul></div><p>Still, color tweaking can be useful for compositions with just a few objects or even for single objects. Unlike all other color selection methods, painting with the Tweak tool implements the <span class="emphasis"><em>color mixing</em></span> metaphor, which is more natural for artists than RGB sliders or even the HSL color wheel. For example, start with a rectangle of pure blue color; then, pick different colors using Color Paint and apply light touches with minimum force and minimum pen pressure: Add a little green, a little brown, a little yellow, and so on until you have the exact mixed tint you need. Similarly, you can whiten or blacken any hue by adding white or black.</p><p><a id="iddle1369" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1575" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1576" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1583" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1613" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1617" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1748" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1760" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1779" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2105" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2124" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2163" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2199" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2206" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2207" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2218" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2315" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2404" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2508" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2595" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2781" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2782" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2783" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2790" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2865" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2866" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2867" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2921" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3707" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3710" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3712" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3729" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3807" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3809" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3919" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4357" class="indexterm"/>You can also use color tweaking to add a tint, darken, lighten, saturate, desaturate, or color-jitter your entire drawing. Just select all in all layers (<span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch05s11.html" title="5.11 Selecting with Keyboard Shortcuts">5.11 Selecting with Keyboard Shortcuts</a></strong></span>), zoom out, choose a large brush width so it covers all of the drawing, and apply a little color tweaking (with minimum <span class="strong"><strong>Force</strong></span>) that will therefore affect all visible objects.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="8.8 Color Extensions and Filters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="eightdot8_color_extensions_and_filters"/>8.8 Color Extensions and Filters</h1></div></div></div><p>So far, we’ve seen quite a number of style setting commands and tools in Inkscape, each with its own approach and capabilities. However, each of them has some downside. In particular, the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog and the selected style indicator cannot edit many different colors without unifying them. The Tweak tool, on the other hand, which can adjust multiple colors at once, requires you to actually paint on canvas and can therefore be slow and imprecise for some tasks.</p><p>As a workaround, a group of extensions in the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> submenu of the <span class="strong"><strong>Extensions</strong></span> menu allows you to adjust all colors of a selection at once. These commands affect both fill and stroke colors, including colors of gradient stops, but excluding bitmaps or patterns. They include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A full set of <span class="emphasis"><em>HSL adjustments</em></span> (increasing and decreasing hue, saturation, or lightness by 5 percent)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Brighter</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Darker</strong></span> (adjust brightness up or down by 10 percent)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Desaturate extension</strong></span> (set HSL saturation to zero)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Grayscale</strong></span> (equalize the three RGB channels; the result is largely similar but different from that of Desaturate)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Negative</strong></span> (for example, convert black to white, yellow to blue, and so on)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Commands for removing or swapping the <span class="emphasis"><em>Red</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Green</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Blue</em></span> channels</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>Custom</strong></span> command which allows you to set your own formulas for modifying the color channels, using the values of other channels if necessary</p></li></ul></div><p>Yet another way to change colors of objects is by using SVG filter effects (<a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Filters">Chapter 17</a>), in particular the preset filters from the <span class="strong"><strong>Filters</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> submenu, or any others using the <span class="strong"><strong>Color Matrix</strong></span> primitive. Compared to extensions, SVG filters are better in that they are nondestructive (the original look and color of an object is preserved and can be restored simply by removing the effect) and work on everything, including bitmaps and patterns. However, filters slow down rendering, and custom filters may be cumbersome to create.</p></div></body></html>
