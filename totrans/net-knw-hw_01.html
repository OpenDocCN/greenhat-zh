You (or your employer or your spouse) bring a computer into your office or your home, and everything is right there: word processing files, financial records, email, music and video, maybe some games, and a connection to the Internet. It's all in one place. Love it or hate it, that computer has become an important part of the way you work and play. In fact, it's so important and so convenient that you eventually decide to add another computer; it might be a laptop that you can carry from one place to another, or maybe a second desktop machine that allows more than one person to use a computer at the same time. And that's when the trouble starts.</p><p>Shortly after you get that additional computer, you will discover that something—a text file or a picture you need for a report, or a music file you want to play, or the modem that connects you to the Internet—is located on the other computer. You have to copy files to a portable disk or a flash drive when you have something to print and carry it to the computer connected to your printer; when you want to scan something you must go to the computer with the scanner; and when you want to connect to the Internet, you must either use the computer with the high-speed connection or wait until another family member has finished using the telephone so you can dial in. Using the computer has risen to a whole new level of inconvenience.</p><p>Any time you (or your family or business) use more than one computer, something you want—a file, a printer, or some other resource—is likely to be located on or connected to the computer you're not currently using; it's inevitable that something you need on <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> computer is stored on or connected to <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> computer. The solution to this problem is easy: Simply connect the computers and allow them to share.</p><p>Congratulations. You have just created a computer network.</p><p>Two or more computers connected through wires, radio signals, flashing lights, or any combination of those and other methods form a <span class="emphasis"><em>network</em></span> that you can use to send and receive instructions and files from one computer to another. Whether you're using your computers at home, at school, in a small business, or even at a temporary gathering such as a business conference or a camping trip (if you're the sort of person who takes computers along on a camping trip), connecting them through a network makes every one of them more useful and more powerful. And when you connect your network to the Internet, every device on your local network also becomes connected to the Internet.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0001"/></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When you connect two or more computers in a network, each computer becomes more useful. There's a rule that describes this, called <span class="emphasis"><em>Metcalfe's Law</em></span>. Robert Metcalfe was the original designer of the Ethernet structure used in most modern computer networks; his law states that the value (or power) of a network increases in proportion to the square of the number of devices connected to that network. The math is pretty subjective, but Metcalfe's Law says that two computers connected together are about 4 times as useful as a single computer; if you connect 10 computers, the network is 100 times more powerful, and so forth.</p></div><p>It's not an exaggeration to say that connecting your computers to a network will change your life. Within just a few days or weeks, you will begin to think about everything connected to the network—other computers, printers, game consoles, the Internet, and anything else—as an extension of your own keyboard and monitor. And shortly after that, you will discover new opportunities and services that a network makes possible.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn about the general nature of computer networks and the things you can do with them. You can find more details about using a network later in this book.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_apostrophy_s_a_network_question"/>What's a Network?</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we begin to consider the things you can do with a computer network, it might be helpful to understand a few basic concepts.</p><p>First, the idea of networks is not limited to computers. A network can be any kind of structure that connects individual objects. The highway system is a network, and so is the worldwide telephone system. You can use either of these networks to interact or communicate with other people connected to the same system. Broadcasting networks such as CBS and the BBC use wires, microwave radio links, and other methods to distribute programs from one or more studios to a large number of local stations.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0004"/></p><p>Every network has the following elements in common:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Two or more objects, or <span class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span>, that use the network to connect them</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A set of communication <span class="emphasis"><em>channels</em></span> that carry something—speech, TV shows, computer data—between or among nodes</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A set of rules that controls network traffic—on a highway, the rules might specify that vehicles drive on the right and pass on the left, and every car and truck must display a license plate to identify it; in a telephone network, the rules define the form and use of unique numbers (called "telephone numbers") to identify each node and establish connections between them. To assure that a network operates properly, every node and every channel must follow the rules for that particular network.</p></li></ul></div><p>Next, every network has a maximum carrying capacity. For example, a four-lane Interstate highway can safely carry more cars and trucks at higher speed than a two-lane country road. In a communications network, the capacity of a network connection is the amount of information it can carry, also known as its <span class="emphasis"><em>bandwidth</em></span>. Both a telephone call and an FM radio station use audio channels, but the same voice sounds better on the FM station because the FM channel has a greater bandwidth that allows more of the original information (in this case, higher audio frequencies) to reach your ear. In a data network, the <span class="emphasis"><em>speed</em></span> of a network is usually shown in millions of bits (or megabits) per second (Mbps).<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0005"/></p><p>And finally, every node on a network has a name. This name might be the same as the name of the person who uses that node, or a description of the location or the type of device at that node. On some networks, the name is a number, or a combination of letters, numbers, and other characters that have no obvious meaning outside of the network (a telephone number is a good example of this type of name). In order to allow the network to accurately find each node, it's essential that every name be unique.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="sneakernet"/>Sneakernet</h1></div></div></div><p>The simplest kind of computer network is no network at all. If you have been working with multiple computers without a network, you know the routine: Every time you need something from a different computer, you have to store a file on a floppy disk, a portable drive, or a flash drive, physically carry it from one computer to another, and load the file onto the second computer. Sometimes you'll take the file from the computer you were originally using to the one that is connected to the right printer. If you've been writing a paper on a laptop computer, you might want to add an image that's stored on the desktop system's hard drive. Or maybe you want to give a copy to a colleague for review or approval. Whatever the reason, you have to carry a copy of one or more computer files from one machine to another.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0012"/></p><p>This usually involves some walking, so the process is often known as <span class="emphasis"><em>sneakernet</em></span>. The name reflects the informal dress common in most computer centers, but if you and your family dress for dinner every evening, or if you're a slave to fashionable footwear, you can think of it as "Oxfordnet" or "Slingbacknet" or "Espadrillenet" instead. Whatever you choose to call it, physically carrying files from one place to another is often a distracting, time-consuming nuisance.</p><p>However, sneakernet does have its uses. When you travel, it can often be easier and more convenient to carry a few files with you rather than retrieve them from a distant computer through the Internet. If you plan to use computers in two or more locations, such as one at school and another at home, you might be better off storing the file on a small portable drive instead of hauling your laptop around.</p><p>When security is an important issue, you might not want to connect your computer to any network. The very best way to protect your confidential data from theft through a network is to make sure the computer where the data is stored has no network access.</p><p>Sneakernet is not always the slowest way to move data from one computer to another. If you want to move a lot of data over a relatively short distance when you don't have a high-speed data connection, it can often be faster to drive a handful of DVDs or a box of tapes across town than to send the same files through a dial-up connection or any other slow network link. It's one of the oldest maxims in the world of computers and networks, but it's still true: Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of floppy disks.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0015"/></p></div>

These links can use wires, radio signals, or a combination of both to move computer data (and any other information that can be converted to and from computer data) between any pair of network nodes.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0022"/></p><p>Every computer connected to a network sends and receives data through a connector or radio antenna. Depending on the data transfer speed and the network's specific requirements, the computer might use a parallel port, a serial port, an Ethernet port, a USB or FireWire port, or a Wi-Fi antenna. Because these connectors and antennas move data in both directions, they are <span class="emphasis"><em>input/output ports</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>I/O ports</em></span>, but that term is more often used to describe the computer's serial and parallel data connectors.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0029"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0030"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0031"/></p><p>After you connect your computers together, you will discover that you can do many things through the network that you may not have expected. By the time you have lived with the network for a few weeks, you won't think much about it, but you'll use it all the time.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="file_sharing"/>File Sharing</h2></div></div></div><p>When you connect your computer to a network, you can allow other people to read and write files that are located on your computer's hard drives and other storage media, and you can open and store files from other computers. File sharing is one of the most common and the most convenient uses of a network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0032"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0033"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0034"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0035"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0036"/></p><p>File sharing has many uses: You can use it to collaborate with other people on a single document or other file, to play music or watch videos stored on another computer, and for just about everything else that you can do with your own files. In effect, every unprotected file stored on any network computer is as easy to use as a file on your own computer.</p><p>For example, <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#the_files_and_folders_on_a_remote_compu" title="Figure 1-1. The files and folders on a remote computer are easy to reach through a network.">Figure 1-1</a> shows a Windows display of disk drives and individual directories on a home network (other file-sharing methods also exist). You can open a file or folder on a remote computer by double-clicking an icon or a filename, just as you would on your own machine.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_files_and_folders_on_a_remote_compu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e430"/><img alt="The files and folders on a remote computer are easy to reach through a network." src="tagoreillycom20090324nostarchimages266190.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 1-1. The files and folders on a remote computer are easy to reach through a network.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Of course, you probably have some files on your own computer that you don't want to share: personal letters, confidential financial records, medical information, and so forth. A well-designed file-sharing system allows each user to set every file or folder as either "public" or "private."</p><p>For more about sharing files with other computers on your home or office network, see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. SHARING FILES THROUGH YOUR NETWORK">Chapter 12</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sharing_an_internet_connection"/>Sharing an Internet Connection</h2></div></div></div><p>When you order a connection to the Internet, the telephone company or the cable TV company installs just one connection point. It doesn't matter if the Internet service uses a dial-up telephone line, a high-speed DSL line, a cable TV service, a fiber optic link, or some kind of radio link; your Internet service terminates in just one place, most often in a piece of electronic equipment called a <span class="emphasis"><em>modem</em></span> (that's geek-speak for <span class="bolditalic">mo</span><span class="emphasis"><em>dulator/</em></span><span class="bolditalic">dem</span><span class="emphasis"><em>odulator</em></span>, a device that converts between computer data and some other type of communications signal). If you have just one computer, you can connect it directly to the modem; but when you want to connect two or more computers to the Internet at the same time, you'll need a network.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0037"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0038"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0039"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0040"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0041"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0042"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0043"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0044"/></p><p>For many families, a high-speed Internet connection provides the reason to start thinking about installing a home network. When you spend that extra money for a DSL or cable Internet link (or fiber optic link), you want easy access to the Internet from every computer in the house. When you connect your network to the modem through a <span class="emphasis"><em>gateway router</em></span> (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#a_gateway_router_provides_a_connection" title="Figure 1-2. A gateway router provides a connection between a local area network and the Internet.">Figure 1-2</a>), you can reach the Internet through any computer on that network.

They're useful for exchanging notes, asking questions, and nonspecific chatter within a business or between friends and family members. When a new message arrives, the messaging program pops up in a new window on the recipient's screen. If you attach a microphone and speaker to each computer, you can use a similar program to speak to the person at the distant computer rather than using the keyboard and screen. And if you add a camera at each end, you can use a video messaging system that allows each of you to see the other party during the conversation.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0048"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0049"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0050"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0051"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0052"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0053"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0054"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0055"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0056"/></p><p>Within a home or small office network, you can use instant messaging, with or without sound and pictures, to communicate from one room to another. It might be a simple message, such as "Dinner's ready," or a more complicated request for information from someone else in the building. And of course, if there are young people in the house, the instant message program will quickly become a channel for gossip and idle conversation.</p><p>For more about instant messaging programs, see <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. OTHER NETWORK APPLICATIONS">Chapter 16</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sharing_printers_and_other_hardware"/>Sharing Printers and Other Hardware</h2></div></div></div><p>In most homes and small businesses, there's no need for every computer to have a printer available for its exclusive use, because nobody uses a printer all the time. It's often more practical to attach a single printer to a network (or maybe one for black-and-white pages and another for color) rather than buying a separate printer for each computer.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-1-0057"/></p><p>When you only need a single printer, you can often buy one that provides better images and faster performance for considerably less than the price of two or three cheaper models. The same kind of economy can also apply to a flatbed scanner and other specialized input or output devices.</p><p>A network printer can either connect directly to the network as a separate node (a <span class="emphasis"><em>printer server</em></span>) or through one of the network's computers.

The same players can also receive and play streaming radio stations from around the world through the Internet. <span class="emphasis"><em>Video servers</em></span> can store movies and other videos and make them available through the network to computers, televisions, and home theater systems.
