- en: In addition to everything we’ve seen so far, you can use Inkscape to create
    simple technical drawings. Let’s try drawing an isometric image of a cross-section
    of an engine part ([Figure 23-13](ch23s05.html#creating_the_inner_surface_of_the_hole
    "Figure 23-13. Creating the inner surface of the hole")). Inkscape does not intend
    to replace a real computer-aided design (CAD) application. It may be more straightforward
    to create such a technical drawing in a CAD program—but only if you have it and
    know how to use it. In most other cases, Inkscape is a natural choice due to its
    graphic power and versatility that can make your drawings not only precise but
    also visually impressive.

- en: 'The key to creating such technical drawings in Inkscape is to use grids (**[7.2
    Grids](ch07s02.html "7.2 Grids")**), snapping (**[7.3 Snapping](ch07s03.html "7.3
    Snapping")**), transforming by numbers (**[6.6 Transforming with Numbers: X, Y,
    W, and H](ch06s06.html "6.6 Transforming with Numbers: X, Y, W, and H")**), and
    shapes, especially rectangles (**[11.2 Rectangles](ch11s02.html "11.2 Rectangles")**).
    As you will see in this tutorial, a combination of these functions makes it possible
    to create the entire drawing without ever once adjusting anything by hand or approximating
    shapes or positions: Every object, handle, and node just snaps into its place
    tightly and precisely. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to produce
    similar drafts quickly and effortlessly.'

    are separated by equal angles (60 degrees) and have the same scale. This makes
    it much easier to use; for example, a cube remains the same length regardless
    of which axis you measure it along.

    "7.2.1 Grid Options")**), choose the **Grids** tab, and create the default axonometric
    grid with both X and Z angles set to 30 degrees (measured from the horizontal).
    You may want to set the spacing (it is called **Spacing Y** even though, the grid
    being isometric, it affects all three axes in the same way) to the minimum measurable
    distance in your drawing. For example, if all dimensions of the drawing elements
    must be in millimeters and precise to the first fractional digit, set the grid
    spacing to 0.1 mm so that you never have to put anything in between grid lines.

    they appear every five regular lines. When you zoom out, minor grid lines disappear
    first to make the display less cluttered.

    the bottom box of our object. With the Rectangle tool, draw a rectangle of any
    size (we will resize and place it later). Notice that the corners of the rectangle
    readily snap to the grid line intersections (pay attention to the snap indicator
    and tips, **[7.3.4 Snapping Preferences](ch07s03.html#sevendot3dot4_snapping_preferences

    the easiest way to skew it into the isometric projection so it fits the grid exactly?

    on the **Skew** tab, specify 60 degrees for the **Horizontal** skew and 30 degrees
    for the **Vertical** skew. After you click **Apply**, the rectangle is transformed
    so that it can serve as the top of the bottom plane of the box. Note that the
    rectangle resize handles now also move in the axonometric projection (**[11.2.1
    Sizing](ch11s02.html#one1dot2dot1_sizing "11.2.1 Sizing")**), so all you need
    to do is snap them into the corresponding grid intersections, as shown in [Figure 23-2](ch23s02.html#creatingcomma_skewingcomma_and_snapping

    by duplicating its sides and re-snapping the corners to new positions. However,

    a flat non-isometric rectangle between them. While workable, this, however, would
    not be the “clean” way to do this, because we don’t have any grid lines at the
    extremities of the ellipses to snap the left and right edges of the rectangle
    to. Such an approach would therefore require turning off snapping and using manual
    tweaking with its inevitable speed/precision tradeoff. Let’s try another method.
