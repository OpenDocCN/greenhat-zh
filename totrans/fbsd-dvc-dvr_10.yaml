- en: In [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Newbus and Resource Allocation") we discussed
    how to allocate IRQs, I/O ports, and I/O memory. [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Interrupt
    Handling") focused on using IRQs for interrupt handling. This chapter details
    how to use I/O ports for port-mapped I/O (PMIO) and I/O memory for memory-mapped
    I/O (MMIO). Before I describe PMIO and MMIO, some background on I/O ports and
    I/O memory is needed.

- en: Every peripheral device is controlled by reading from and writing to its registers
    (Corbet et al., 2005), which are mapped to either I/O ports or I/O memory. The
    use of I/O ports or I/O memory is device and architecture dependent. For example,
    on the *i386*, most ISA devices will map their registers to I/O ports; however,
    PCI devices tend to map their registers to I/O memory. As you may have guessed,
    reading and writing to a device’s registers, which are mapped to either I/O ports
    or I/O memory, is called PMIO or MMIO.
