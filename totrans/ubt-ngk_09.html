In this era of graphical interfaces, the idea of typing commands to get things done seems like a dreadful throwback to the days of DOS, and that puts many people off, especially those who remember what it was like in the "old days."</p><p>This reaction is fair enough, but it is not really an accurate reflection of the reality of the Linux world. After all, most Linux users today utilize some sort of graphical interface. They can, and often do, achieve all that they hope to achieve through drop-down menus and mouse clicks alone. Many are able to survive quite happily without ever once opening their Terminal. The same could be true of you.</p><p>Be that as it may, there is still much to be said for the power and convenience of the command line. The fact that the command line can now be utilized within a graphical environment also makes it much less forbidding. The Terminal is just a tiny text-based island in a sea of graphical bodies (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#putting_the_terminal_in_perspective" title="Figure 9-1. Putting the Terminal in perspective">Figure 9-1</a>). Using the command line can be as pain-free as anything else you do on your system, and it can actually provide you with a little fun if you are willing to give it a try.</p><div class="figure"><a id="putting_the_terminal_in_perspective"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11051"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656363.png.jpg" alt="Putting the Terminal in perspective"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-1. Putting the Terminal in perspective</p></div><p>Unfortunately, many guides to using the command line are written by hard-core command-line junkies, whose enthusiasm for what they see as a really good thing inadvertently makes what they write seem even more off-putting to the recent Linux immigrant or wanna-be.</p><p>For your sake, I will try to curb my own enthusiasm so as not to scare you right back to <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a> and the more comfortable world of the Ubuntu Software Center. I will also try to help you keep things in perspective by teaching you, whenever possible, to use the command line as a complement to the various graphical tools that you have at your disposal, rather than presenting it as the sole way of going about things. Of course, I am not going to cover every possible angle in this regard—just enough to give you some exposure and experience and, ideally, make you feel at least a little more at ease with the command line. Who knows; could you actually come to think of using the command line as . . . fun? Well, I won't get too carried away.</p><div class="sect1" title="Meet the Terminal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="meet_the_terminal"/>Meet the Terminal</h1></div></div></div><p>You can run the Linux command-line Terminal application in your Ubuntu system by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Accessories</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>. When the Terminal opens, it will, in all its simplicity, look much like <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#the_terminal_application" title="Figure 9-2. The Terminal application">Figure 9-2</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0763" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_terminal_application"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11086"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656365.png.jpg" alt="The Terminal application"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-2. The Terminal application</p></div><p>As you can see, all it says is <code class="literal">rg@rg-desktop:˜$</code>. In this case, <code class="literal">rg</code> is my username, <code class="literal">rg-desktop</code> is the name I gave my computer during installation, and the tilde (<code class="literal">˜</code>) signifies that I am in my home folder. If it were to say <code class="literal">˜/Music</code>, for example, it would mean that I am currently in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder within my home folder. Of course, all this will be different in your case, because your username and computer name will be different. If your username is <span class="emphasis"><em>frog</em></span> and your computer's name is <span class="emphasis"><em>wetrock</em></span>, for example, the command line will say <code class="literal">frog@wetrock:˜$</code>. If all this is sounding rather obtuse to you, just think of it this way: <em class="replaceable"><code>user-name</code></em><code class="literal">@</code><em class="replaceable"><code>computer_name</code></em><code class="literal">:˜$</code> in the Terminal is the equivalent of your home folder in Nautilus.</p><p>Typing in the Terminal is straightforward enough; you just type as you usually do. You can also delete and insert letters or phrases by using the <span class="keycap"><strong>delete</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>backspace</strong></span> keys and the arrow keys. For practice, try the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>I like strawberries so very much</code></strong>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change <code class="literal">strawberries</code> to <code class="literal">cherries</code> (because cherries are, in fact, so much better). Just use your left arrow key to move the cursor in front of the first <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> in <code class="literal">strawberries</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tap your <span class="keycap"><strong>delete</strong></span> key as many times as necessary to erase the word <code class="literal">strawberries</code> (uh, that would be 12 times, methinks).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>cherries</code></strong>, and then use your right arrow key to move the cursor back to the end of this meaningful sentence.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now that you've completed this fascinating bit of typing practice, press the <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> key. As you will almost immediately see, the Terminal's response to your efforts thus far is merely a dismissive <code class="literal">I: command not found</code>. Although you've typed a string of text that has meaning to you, it means absolutely nothing to your system. In fact, the system was so shortsighted that it could see nothing other than the first word you typed in the Terminal (<code class="literal">I</code>); and because <code class="literal">I</code> is not a valid command, the system had no idea what do to with it.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Some Goofy Yet Useful Fun with the Command Terminal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="some_goofy_yet_useful_fun_with_the_comma"/>Some Goofy Yet Useful Fun with the Command Terminal</h1></div></div></div><p>A rather cool thing about typing in the command Terminal is that it has what you might call <span class="emphasis"><em>short-term memory</em></span>. Try it by typing the word <strong class="userinput"><code>cherry</code></strong> and then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. Ignoring the command-not-found message, go on and type <strong class="userinput"><code>vanilla</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. Now type <strong class="userinput"><code>gelato</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. So far, so dumb, right? Well, not really. Let's type everything we've typed thus far again, but this time let's do it with only one key.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0764" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0765" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Huh?</p><p>Yes, just press the up arrow key once, and what do you see? That's right—the last command you typed appears, which in this case would be <code class="literal">gelato</code>. Press the up arrow key again, and the command that you typed before that will appear—<code class="literal">vanilla</code>. One more time? Yes, <code class="literal">cherry</code>. And one more time for the grand finale . . . <code class="literal">I like cherries so very much</code>.</p><p>Considering what we have thus far, this may all seem a bit silly, but imagine that you're not typing goofy little words and instead have to deal with considerably longer strings, such as a simple copy command (which you'll learn about later in this chapter) like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e11243"/><pre class="programlisting">cp Photos/mypics/stpierre/coastal/onthebeach1_27.jpg /home/frog/photos_for_mom/stpierre</pre><p>By typing that string, you are copying an image called <span class="emphasis"><em>onthebeach1_27.jpg</em></span> from the <span class="emphasis"><em>coastal</em></span> folder to another folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>stpierre</em></span>. If you wanted to copy another photo in the <span class="emphasis"><em>coastal</em></span> folder, <span class="emphasis"><em>onthebeach1_16.jpg</em></span>, for instance, you could simply press the up arrow key once, use the left arrow key and <span class="keycap"><strong>delete</strong></span> key to move over to and delete the <code class="literal">27</code>, and replace it with <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong>. All in all, it would be much simpler and much faster. It would also help you avoid mistakes in typing. Not so dumb anymore, eh?</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="Nontoxic Commands"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="nontoxic_commands"/>Nontoxic Commands</h1></div></div></div><p>As you now know, all of this typing is easy enough, but to actually do something useful with your Terminal, you need to type commands—and there are more of them than you could ever hope or need to know. To get you started, we will begin with some commands that are easy to understand, nontoxic, and completely kitten-friendly.</p><div class="sect2" title="$ whoami"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_whoami"/>$ whoami</h2></div></div></div><p>There is no command as easy, safe, or even as seemingly useless as <code class="literal">whoami</code>. Rather than help those with multiple-personality disorders discover who they are at any given moment, the <code class="literal">whoami</code> command simply tells you which user is currently logged in. Try it by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>whoami</code></strong> after the <code class="literal">$</code> and then pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> key. Remember that commands are case sensitive.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0766" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0767" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The Terminal will now tell you the username of the person currently logged in. If you are logged in as <span class="emphasis"><em>frog</em></span>, you should get <code class="literal">frog</code> as the answer to your command.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ finger"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_finger"/>$ finger</h2></div></div></div><p>If you enjoyed discovering who you are with the <code class="literal">whoami</code> command, then you might enjoy finding out even more about yourself using the <code class="literal">finger</code> command. You can use the <code class="literal">finger</code> command in a number of ways, but a very simple one is finding out about a particular user. Try this on yourself by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>finger</code></strong> and then your username. In my case, that would be <strong class="userinput"><code>finger rg</code></strong>. Once you've typed the command, press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, and see what you get. You can see my results in <a class="xref" href="ch09s03.html#output_from_the_finger_command" title="Figure 9-3. Output from the finger command">Figure 9-3</a>.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0768" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0769" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0770" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0771" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_finger_command"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11367"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656367.png.jpg" alt="Output from the finger command"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-3. Output from the <code class="literal">finger</code> command</p></div><p>As you can see, my login name is <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>, my real name is Rickford Grant, my home directory is <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/rg</em></span>, and I am using the Bash shell for typing my commands. I have been logged on since Wednesday, April 14, at 19:59 Eastern daylight time (EDT), and I've had my Terminal session open since Thursday, April 15, at 19:26. I have no mail or plan. It doesn't tell you my Social Security number or my mother's maiden name, but it is pretty cool, don't you think?</p><div class="sect3" title="What Is a Shell?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="what_is_a_shell_question"/>What Is a Shell?</h3></div></div></div><p>As you noticed, I mentioned that the results of the <code class="literal">finger</code> command showed I was using the Bash shell, so you may be understandably wondering just what Bash is. Well, Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the many shells that are used in Linux systems, and it's the one that happens to come with your Ubuntu distro (and most others, for that matter). A <span class="emphasis"><em>shell</em></span> is a program that interprets the commands you type into the Terminal and delivers them, so to speak, to your system so that it can act upon them. I like to think of it as a command-handling subsystem, for which the Terminal acts as a graphical frontend.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0772" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect3" title="What Is a Plan?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="what_is_a_plan_question"/>What Is a Plan?</h3></div></div></div><p>I also mentioned that the results said I had no plan, so you may also be wondering what that is all about. A <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file is a small file kept in your home folder that other users see when they use the <code class="literal">finger</code> command on you. Traditionally, a <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file contained information about where you were going to be or what you were working on. These days, however, most people use them to leave odd little messages, quotations, or whatever, much as they do in email signatures. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="ch09s03.html#output_from_the_finger_command_with_a_pl" title="Figure 9-4. Output from the finger command with a plan">Figure 9-4</a> to see what happens after I add a <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file to my home folder.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0773" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0774" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0775" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_finger_command_with_a_pl"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11442"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656369.png.jpg" alt="Output from the finger command with a plan"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-4. Output from the <code class="literal">finger</code> command with a plan</p></div><p>You can now see my plan, which is a quotation from Kurt Vonnegut's <span class="emphasis"><em>The Sirens of Titan</em></span> (or Al Stewart's song by the same name, for that matter), though you can put anything you want in your own. You will get the chance to create your own plan file in Project 9A, so if this all seems fun to you, just hang in there.</p><p>Before moving on, I should mention that you can also use the <code class="literal">finger</code> command to do a little domestic espionage of sorts. Let's say your child, Chris, has a user account on your machine. Chris, who wants your permission to go to the movies, claims to have been hard at work on the computer all day writing a report for school. Having your doubts, you could type <strong class="userinput"><code>finger chris</code></strong> to see what the facts actually are. It may be a bit underhanded and rotten, but it works. It also works both ways; others can check up on you as well. You can try it by seeing when the last time you logged in to your graphika account was (assuming you created such an account in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. DRESSING UP THE BIRD">Chapter 8</a>). Just type <strong class="userinput"><code>finger graphika</code></strong>, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.</p><p>You can even use the <code class="literal">finger</code> command to find out facts about people on other systems, providing their network's finger service is active and you know their email address. Typing something like <strong class="userinput"><code>finger</code></strong> <em class="replaceable"><code>username@hostname.com</code></em> would do the trick. It's kind of cool but also kind of spooky, I suppose.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="$ pwd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_pwd"/>$ pwd</h2></div></div></div><p>If you know who you are but aren't exactly sure where you are, <code class="literal">pwd</code> (print working directory) should come in handy. The <code class="literal">pwd</code> command tells you exactly where the Terminal is in your directory tree.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0776" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0777" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0778" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0779" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0780" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0781" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0782" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0783" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Let's say, for example, that my Terminal is in my personal home directory (which is actually called <span class="emphasis"><em>rg</em></span>) in the system's home directory (which is actually called <span class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span> and which is where all the user account directories are located) when I use the <code class="literal">pwd</code> command; I would, after pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> key, get <code class="literal">/home/rg</code> printed to my Terminal. You should get similar results if you try it.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The word <span class="emphasis"><em>print</em></span>, in this case, has nothing to do with your printer; it merely means that the response will be printed to, or displayed in, the Terminal.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="$ df"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_df"/>$ df</h2></div></div></div><p>Another safe and easy, but much more useful, command is <code class="literal">df</code> (disk filesystem). The <code class="literal">df</code> command tells you how much disk space you have used, as well as how much space you still have available, on each of the partitions on your various mounted disks. Try it by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>df</code></strong> and then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. Your output should look something like that shown in <a class="xref" href="ch09s03.html#output_from_the_df_command" title="Figure 9-5. Output from the df command">Figure 9-5</a> (depending, of course, on the size of your mounted disks and how they are set up).<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0784" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0785" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0786" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_df_command"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11608"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656371.png.jpg" alt="Output from the df command"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-5. Output from the <code class="literal">df</code> command</p></div><p>As you will notice, the sizes are given in kilobytes (KB) rather than the gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB) you are probably more used to, but there is a way around this. Many commands accept a <span class="emphasis"><em>flag</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>option</em></span>, to further fine-tune how the command performs. These flags are written directly after the main command and are preceded by a space and a hyphen.</p><p>In this case, you can try using the <code class="literal">-h</code> (human readable) flag to have your figures come out in the way you are most familiar with. Try this by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>df -h</code></strong> on the command line and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The output should now appear in a more familiar format (see <a class="xref" href="ch09s03.html#output_from_the_df_command_with_the_-h_f" title="Figure 9-6. Output from the df command with the -h flag">Figure 9-6</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="output_from_the_df_command_with_the_-h_f"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e11643"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656373.png.jpg" alt="Output from the df command with the -h flag"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-6. Output from the <code class="literal">df</code> command with the <code class="literal">-h</code> flag</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="$ ls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_ls"/>$ ls</h2></div></div></div><p>Another harmless but handy command is <code class="literal">ls</code> (list directory contents).

To use it, just type the command followed by the permissions you want to extend to a file and then the location of the file itself. For example, let's say you copied a JPEG file, <span class="emphasis"><em>mybirthday.jpg</em></span>, from a CD to the <span class="emphasis"><em>personal</em></span> subfolder within the <span class="emphasis"><em>Photos</em></span> folder on your hard disk, and the file is write protected.

If you want to figure out permission numbers for yourself, it is pretty easy. You are basically dealing with three number positions, each of which has eight numerical possibilities (<code class="literal">0</code>–<code class="literal">7</code>).

Add any of those numbers together, and you get the other permission combos. For example, 1 (execute) + 4 (read) = 5 (read and execute).

You needn't practice with these yet, because you will be using them very soon, but you might as well know what they are all about.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0875" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0876" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0877" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0878" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0879" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0880" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="$ ln"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_ln"/>$ ln</h2></div></div></div><p>You use the <code class="literal">ln</code> (link) command to create a link file that launches or activates another file located in a separate folder. This is very useful when trying to activate a file that is buried deep in the subfolder of a subfolder of a subfolder somewhere on your hard disk. The command is very often used with the <code class="literal">-s</code> (symbolic) flag, which provides essentially the same thing as the shortcut you've come to know in Windows or the alias on the Mac.</p><p>The easiest way to use the <code class="literal">ln</code> command is to first use the <code class="literal">cd</code> command to change the Terminal's location to the folder where you want to place the link. Then you can type the <strong class="userinput"><code>ln</code></strong> command on the command line, followed by the path of the file to which you want to link. For example, let's say you want to put a link in your home folder for an OpenOffice.org Writer file of your autobiography called <span class="emphasis"><em>myLife.odt</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0881" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The file is pretty well buried in a nest of subfolders deep within your home folder: <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/</em></span>username<span class="emphasis"><em>/Documents/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.odt</em></span>. To create the link, you would open a new Terminal window, type the following command string, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13238"/><pre class="programlisting">ln -s Documents/personal/self/autobiography/myLife.odt</pre><p>Once you are finished, the link will appear in your home folder as an icon matching the original file in appearance, albeit sporting an arrow to signify that it is a link.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="$ tar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dollar_tar"/>$ tar</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. A TIDY NEST">Chapter 7</a> you learned to create and extract archives, or <span class="emphasis"><em>tarballs</em></span>, but did you know that you can also create and extract tarballs using the command line? The <code class="literal">tar</code> command is your key to doing this.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0882" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0883" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0884" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0885" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0886" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0887" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0888" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0889" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0890" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To create an archive, you would simply type <strong class="userinput"><code>tar -cvf</code></strong>, followed by the name the final tarball will be, and then the name of the folder or file you are trying to archive. For example, let's say you want to create an archive of your photos folder, and you want to call it <span class="emphasis"><em>pics4pals</em></span>. In this case, you would type the following command and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13319"/><pre class="programlisting">tar –cvf pics4pals.tar photos</pre><p>As you no doubt noticed, there are some flags after the <code class="literal">tar</code> command in that string. The <code class="literal">c</code> tells the tar program to <span class="emphasis"><em>create</em></span> a new archive. The <code class="literal">v</code> tells the program to be <span class="emphasis"><em>verbose</em></span>, or, in other words, to tell you what it is doing in the Terminal as it is doing it. Finally, the <code class="literal">f</code> tells the program that what follows is the <span class="emphasis"><em>file information</em></span>.</p><p>If, after creating the archive, you suddenly remember that there is one more file you want to add to the mix, you can use the <code class="literal">-r</code> flag to append the archive.</p><p>For example, to add a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>cranky.png</em></span> to the archive, you would type the following and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13358"/><pre class="programlisting">tar -rvf pics4pals.tar cranky.png</pre><p>Of course, chances are that you will be doing more tarball extracting than creating, so you no doubt want to know how to do that. Fortunately, the process is pretty similar to what you use when creating the tarball. The main difference is in the first flag. Rather than using the <code class="literal">tar</code> command with the <code class="literal">-c</code> flag, you would instead use it with the <code class="literal">-x</code> flag, which tells the tar program to <span class="emphasis"><em>extract</em></span> the specified archive. So if you want to extract a tarball called <span class="emphasis"><em>spicyfood.tar</em></span>, type the following command, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13381"/><pre class="programlisting">tar -xvf spicyfood.tar</pre><p>What you have been doing thus far is creating and extracting archives, which are basically just collections of files. They are not, however, compressed. In fact, most tarballs you find will be compressed, and you can tell by the ending <span class="emphasis"><em>tar.gz</em></span>. That <span class="emphasis"><em>gz</em></span> means that the archive was compressed using the gzip program. Extracting a compressed tarball is just as easy as extracting a straight tar archive; all you have to do is add the <code class="literal">-z</code> flag, which tells your system to use the gzip program to decompress the archive. For example, if you want to extract a compressed tarball called <span class="emphasis"><em>goosedown.tar.gz</em></span>, type the following command, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13401"/><pre class="programlisting">tar -xzvf goosedown.tar.gz</pre><p>Well, now that you know how to decompress and extract a gzipped tarball, you probably want to know how to create one. This is, again, little different than creating the tar archive itself; you would just add the <code class="literal">-z</code> tag to tell the program to use gzip to compress the folder. For example, to create a compressed version of your <span class="emphasis"><em>Documentia</em></span> folder, which we'll call <span class="emphasis"><em>tightdocs.tar.gz</em></span>, you would type the following and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:</p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e13417"/><pre class="programlisting">tar –czvf tightdocs.tar.gz Documentia</pre><p>It's worth mentioning at this point that you may also come across some files compressed with the bzip program. Such files are recognizable by some variation on the <span class="emphasis"><em>.bz</em></span> or .<span class="emphasis"><em>bz2</em></span> file extension. Dealing with these files should pose no problem, because the commands are almost identical to those for gzip. Just substitute <code class="literal">-j</code> for <code class="literal">-z</code> in the command string.</p><div class="sect3" title="Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="compressing_and_extracting_compressed_si"/>Compressing and Extracting Compressed Single Files</h3></div></div></div><p>If you want to compress or decompress a single file, you don't really need to use the tar program at all, since its purpose is to create archives consisting of several files. You can instead use the <code class="literal">gzip</code> and <code class="literal">gunzip</code> commands directly. For example, to compress a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.png</em></span>, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gzip matilda.png</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.png</em></span> file would then become <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg.gz</em></span>. To decompress the file, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gunzip matilda.jpg.gz</code></strong> and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, after which the <span class="emphasis"><em>matilda.jpg</em></span> file would be back to normal.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0891" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0892" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0893" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0894" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0895" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0896" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0897" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0898" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0899" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0900" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0901" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0902" class="indexterm"/></p><p>So, can you compress an archive you've already created with the <code class="literal">tar</code> command? Sure. For example, to compress the <span class="emphasis"><em>spicyfood.tar</em></span> archive mentioned earlier, you would type <strong class="userinput"><code>gzip spicyfood.tar</code></strong>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>voila</em></span>—you've got yourslf a compressed <span class="emphasis"><em>spicyfood.tar.gz</em></span> archive.

In this project, you'll start off easy by creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file, like the one mentioned earlier in the chapter.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0905" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The actual <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file is a hidden file (as you can see by the dot before its name), which contains the plan or message that you add to that file. That message will appear in the output of someone's Terminal when they use the <code class="literal">finger</code> command to find out more about you. You may not need such a <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file, but it is an easy enough way to get started working a bit more with commands and the Terminal itself, so let's give it a try.</p><p>To start out, you'll open the Terminal-based Pico editor to create the <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file. To do this, open a Terminal window, type <strong class="userinput"><code>pico .plan</code></strong> (being sure to put a space between <code class="literal">pico</code> and <code class="literal">.plan</code>), and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.

All you have to do now is type your plan or message. Once you've done that, press <span class="keycap"><strong>ctrl</strong></span>-X to exit the Pico editor, and it will ask you whether you want to save your work. You do, so type <strong class="userinput"><code>Y</code></strong>, after which you will be presented with a set of save options. You have already named the file <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span>, as you can see near the bottom of the screen, so all you have to do is press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. You will be back at your now-familiar user prompt in the Terminal window.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_pico_editor"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e13646"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656385.png.jpg" alt="The Pico editor"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-12. The Pico editor</p></div><p>To wrap things up, you want to change the permission of the new <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>chmod 644 .plan</code></strong> in the Terminal window and then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file should now be in your home folder and readable (see Note below) by all, so go on and test your work by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>finger</code></strong> <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The message you entered in your <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file should now appear in the results in place of the <code class="literal">no Plan</code> you found there earlier. If you want to change the contents of your <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file later, just follow the same steps, and change the text when the <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> appears in the Pico editor.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The name of the <span class="emphasis"><em>.plan</em></span> file is preceded by a period, which means that it is a hidden file.

You will learn a little more about this distinction in later in the chapter, but one of the differences I can mention right off the bat is that you don't actually have to install pyWings; you are simply going to put it on your hard drive in your home folder and run it from there, more or less as is.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0911" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0912" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="9B-1: Getting Ready for pyWings (Installing Tkinter)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_getting_ready_for_pywings_open"/>9B-1: Getting Ready for pyWings (Installing Tkinter)</h2></div></div></div><p>As I mentioned, one difference between pyWings and most of the other applications you know is that pyWings is a Python script. To create a graphical interface for itself, pyWings uses a toolbox known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Tkinter</em></span>, which is the de facto standard (though not the only) GUI toolbox for Python. Tkinter, however, no longer comes bundled with Ubuntu, so you will need to download and install it yourself. Fortunately, this is quite easily done.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0913" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0914" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0915" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Although it is possible to whip open the Ubuntu Software Center and install Tkinter by the simple means learned in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a>, it seems more appropriate in this command line–oriented chapter to . . . yeah, you got it, use the command line.

Let's find a way to make things easier in the future.</p><p>To run an application from the Terminal, you generally type the name of that application, or, to put it more precisely, the name of that program's executable file; the application's name thus acts as a sort of command. For your system to recognize that command, however, the command (the executable file or a link to it) must be in a location where the system can find it. Whenever you run a command of any sort, your system checks a series of locations (most of which are <span class="emphasis"><em>bin folders</em></span>, where executable files are located) to find that command.</p><p>You can easily find out where these locations are by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>echo $PATH</code></strong> in a new Terminal window and then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. As you will see, on your Ubuntu system, these locations are as follows:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/bin</em></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/bin</em></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/sbin</em></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/bin</em></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/sbin</em></span></p></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/games</em></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/sbin</em></span></p></td><td style=""> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The results of the <code class="literal">echo $PATH</code> command will not appear as they do in the easier-to-read chart shown here but, rather, in a single line divided by colons. The actual output shown in the Terminal is <em class="replaceable"><code>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games</code></em>.</p></div><p>If the command you typed is in one of those locations, the program, or script, will run. As you no doubt know, however, pyWings is not in any of those locations. It is in <span class="emphasis"><em>/home/</em></span>username<span class="emphasis"><em>/LocalApps/pyWings</em></span> and is thus, in a sense, out of your system's sight.</p><p>To remedy this situation, you could add the path of your pyWings script to the list of paths that the system checks for run commands, so as to make the system aware of your new application's existence. However, let's try another method that I think is easier. What you will do is create a link to pyWings, a sort of launchable alias, in one of the locations your system does check for commands.</p><p>To create this link, you will be using three commands: <code class="literal">cd</code> (to change directories), <code class="literal">sudo</code> (to give yourself write access to the destination folder), and <code class="literal">ln -s</code> (to create the link).</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In the Terminal, type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd /usr/games</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.

(Note that there is a space between the words <code class="literal">pywings.py</code> and <code class="literal">pywings</code> at the end of that command string.)</p><p>The <code class="literal">pywings</code> at the end of that command string is the name that you are giving the link; the name of the link thus becomes the command you will use to run the application. If you type nothing, the link will be called <span class="emphasis"><em>pywings.py</em></span>, which would mean three more keystrokes for you every time you wanted to start the program.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type your password when prompted to do so, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type <strong class="userinput"><code>cd</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> to return the Terminal to your home folder.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" title="9B-8: Running pyWings Again"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-8_colon_running_pywings_again"/>9B-8: Running pyWings Again</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have created the link, you should be able to run the pyWings program much more easily. To try it, quit pyWings (if it is still running), type <strong class="userinput"><code>pywings</code></strong> in the Terminal window, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. Your personal pyWings oracle should appear again.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0928" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You've managed to cut down on the number of keystrokes required to run pyWings from the Terminal. However, if you are really into this pyWings thing and want to use it often, it will probably be handiest to add a launcher to your panel, a drawer, or the Applications menu.</p><p>To add a pyWings panel launcher, for example, right-click any open space in the panel, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add to Panel</strong></span>. When the Add to Panel window appears, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Application Launcher</strong></span> item, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>. In the Create Launcher window that appears, type <strong class="userinput"><code>pyWings</code></strong> in the Name section, anything you want in the Comment section (<strong class="userinput"><code>Your Obtuse Guru</code></strong>, for example), and, assuming you created a launchable link in Project 9B-7, type <strong class="userinput"><code>pywings</code></strong> in the Command section. For an icon, click the <span class="strong"><strong>No Icon</strong></span> button, and then look around until you find an icon that suits your fancy. I like <span class="emphasis"><em>gnome-eog.png</em></span> myself. Once you've made your selection, click <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> in the Browse icons window, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> in the Create Launcher window.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="9B-9: Adding Emblems to Your LocalApps Folder"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-9_colon_adding_emblems_to_your_localap"/>9B-9: Adding Emblems to Your LocalApps Folder</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that pyWings is successfully installed and working, it is probably a good idea to add an emblem to your new <span class="emphasis"><em>LocalApps</em></span> folder so that you don't inadvertently dump it in the Trash someday.

For the beginner, just the mention of compiling a program from source seems off-putting enough.

Still, once in the Linux world, you are likely to come across this installation method and may well become curious, especially if you move into the geekier side of the community.</p><div class="sect2" title="So, What Is Source?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="so_comma_what_is_source_question"/>So, What Is Source?</h2></div></div></div><p>To get started, it is probably a good idea to understand what <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span> is so as to help you to understand a bit about how a program actually gets from its primitive state on the programmer's computer to an up-and-running application on your machine. First the programmer writes a program in a programming language. You have probably heard of programming languages such as BASIC or C, and there are many others. What the programmer actually writes with such a language is a set of instructions called the <span class="emphasis"><em>source code</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span>. Your computer, however, cannot actually understand any of that source on its own. It is as if the computer speaks ancient Greek, and the source code is all written in French. The computer therefore needs some sort of interpreter to help it out.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0959" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0960" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The various languages that programmers use are called <span class="emphasis"><em>high-level languages</em></span>—they are relatively easy for programmers to read. The computer, on the other hand, only understands <span class="emphasis"><em>low-level languages</em></span>, which are quite difficult for most mere mortal programmers to deal with. To convert the high-level language instructions to a low-level language, the computer needs some other program to translate.</p><p>If this translation process actually takes place while a program is running, the translator program is called an <span class="emphasis"><em>interpreter</em></span>. Applications that run using an interpreter are usually called <span class="emphasis"><em>scripts</em></span>. The pyWings and Briscola applications earlier in this chapter are examples of such script applications.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0961" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The problem with such scripts is that they can be slower than most of the applications you're familiar with—the computer must run an interpreter, interpret the source code, and run the actual application all at the same time. This is like having a French book translated into Greek by a live interpreter; it's very slow indeed.</p><p>As an alternative, most programs use a compiler instead of an interpreter. A <span class="emphasis"><em>compiler</em></span> translates the high-level source code into low-level <span class="emphasis"><em>machine code</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>object code</em></span>, that the computer can understand before the application is actually run. Once this translation is done, the computer never has to bother with the high-level instructions again; it can merely read the translated version each time it runs the program. This is like having a translated version of a foreign book that you can read any time you want. Because computers can run compiled programs without simultaneously using an interpreter, compiled programs run faster than scripts. Most applications for all operating systems are, therefore, compiled.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0962" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0963" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Basics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="the_basics"/>The Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>The actual process of compiling an application from source and then installing it is quite simple—a truly "one, two, three" bit of presto change-o.

Because Ubuntu is designed with the average computer user in mind, it does not come with the various applications and libraries you need to compile applications from source. Fortunately, however, everything you need to get the job done is available via the Ubuntu Software Center. To get ready for the work at hand in this chapter (and many other jobs you are likely to do on your own in the future), perform searches for and install the following packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>build-essential</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>libgtk2.0-dev</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="9D-2: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg File"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-2_colon_downloading_and_extracting_the"/>9D-2: Downloading and Extracting the Xmahjongg File</h2></div></div></div><p>To get some hands-on experience with compiling a program from source, you will be working with a game called <span class="emphasis"><em>Xmahjongg</em></span>, which you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch09s09.html#the_xmahjongg_game" title="Figure 9-17. The Xmahjongg game">Figure 9-17</a>. If you've tried the version of Mahjongg that comes with your Ubuntu distribution, you will notice that this one is much easier on your eyes and is a bit more colorful (check out the project site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/">http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/</a> to catch a glimpse of it in its full-color glory).<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0973" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="the_xmahjongg_game"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e14877"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656395.png.jpg" alt="The Xmahjongg game"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-17. The Xmahjongg game</p></div><p>Xmahjongg is available via the Ubuntu Software Center, so it is not absolutely necessary to install it in the way you are about to, but doing so provides a perfect opportunity to learn how to compile a program from source. The amount of source code isn't all that great, so it won't take too much time to do, and it requires no tinkering.</p><p>To get started, you will first have to download the Xmahjongg source code. You can get this from the Xmahjongg project page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/">http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/</a>. Download the tarball <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz</em></span>, or a newer version if there is one. Do not download any of the other file types available on that page.</p><p>If you prefer, you can instead download the Xmahjongg tarball by using the <code class="literal">wget</code> command that you learned in Project 9C-1. Just open a Terminal window, type the following command, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>:<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0974" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting9_d1e14904"/><pre class="programlisting">wget http://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz</pre><p>Once you have the file on your hard disk, untar the <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7.tar.gz</em></span> file. You can do this either by using the command line, as you learned to do earlier in the chapter, or by double-clicking the file and dragging its contents into the appropriate folder. To make it easier for you to follow along with the directions I'll be giving you, be sure to place the untarred Xmahjongg folder in your home folder. Then you will be ready to roll.</p><p>Normally at this point, you would look through the folder to find some instructions for dealing with the package, just as you did earlier in the chapter for Briscola. In most source code packages, this information is included in an INSTALL file, like the one in the <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7</em></span> folder (<a class="xref" href="ch09s09.html#identifying_a_package_apostrophy_s_insta" title="Figure 9-18. Identifying a package's INSTALL file">Figure 9-18</a>). To read the INSTALL file, just double-click it, and it will open in Gedit.</p><p>In this case, you can simply close the INSTALL file, because it prescribes the same steps I've listed next. However, in the future, when you install other programs from source, you will need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL files that come with the source files. However, with most INSTALL files, the instructions will match the process I am about to describe.</p><p>Of course, it may well happen that you take a look at the contents of the INSTALL file and start wondering what alien tongue it is written in. In cases when you have no idea what the INSTALL file is going on about, just look for a <span class="emphasis"><em>configure</em></span> file in the package folder. If you find one, you should be able to follow the instructions in this project.</p><div class="figure"><a id="identifying_a_package_apostrophy_s_insta"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e14929"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656397.png.jpg" alt="Identifying a package's INSTALL file"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 9-18. Identifying a package's INSTALL file</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="9D-3: Running configure and make for Xmahjongg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-3_colon_running_configure_and_make_for"/>9D-3: Running configure and make for Xmahjongg</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have downloaded and untarred the Xmahjongg tarball, installation is pretty standard. Here's what you need to do:<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0976" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0977" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0975" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open a Terminal window, and then move into the new folder by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>cd xmahjongg*</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.</p><p>The next step is sort of a setup phase that runs the configure script in the <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7</em></span> folder. The configure script checks what files, compilers, and other things it needs, and then it searches your computer to see whether those things are there and, if so, where. Based on this information, it writes a file called a <span class="emphasis"><em>makefile</em></span>, which is a set of instructions that will tell the <code class="literal">make</code> command in the subsequent step how to set things up specifically for your system configuration.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0978" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Configure the program by typing <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure</code></strong> and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.</p><p>While you are running <code class="literal">configure</code>, you will see lots of odd and mysterious things flowing through your Terminal window; this is essentially a running account of what is going on, each step of the way. This can take a bit of time, but don't worry. As long as the mysterious text keeps flowing and you don't get an error message at the very end of the whole process, all will be well.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0979" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When <code class="literal">configure</code> has done its thing, you will see your prompt again, and you can go on to the next step, which is the translation, or <span class="emphasis"><em>compilation</em></span>, step. The <code class="literal">make</code> command reads the makefile created by <code class="literal">configure</code> to see how things need to be set up on your machine. Then it proceeds to call on the compiler to translate the high-level source code into low-level, machine-readable files that can be installed in the subsequent step.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0980" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To perform this translation, type <strong class="userinput"><code>make</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.</p><p>Again, you will be treated to even more mysterious text flowing through the window and a short wait, usually a tad longer than for the configure process. Once <code class="literal">make</code> has done its job and you see your prompt again, you are ready to install the program.</p></li></ol></div><p>Up to this point, you have not changed your system in any way. All the changes thus far have taken place in the <span class="emphasis"><em>xmahjongg-3.7</em></span> folder only—your system is still as pure as the day you started. Of course, all that is going to end right now when you perform the final installation step.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="9D-4: Installing and Running Xmahjongg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-4_colon_installing_and_running_xmahjon"/>9D-4: Installing and Running Xmahjongg</h2></div></div></div><p>Now you've come to the last step in this part of the process, <code class="literal">make install</code>. Here you are telling your system to install what you have created, or <span class="emphasis"><em>compiled</em></span>, in the <code class="literal">make</code> step. Note that because installation takes place in permissions-protected parts of your system, you will need to add <code class="literal">sudo</code> to the command string to give yourself administrative privileges.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0983" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0984" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0985" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0986" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0987" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0981" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0982" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To perform the installation, type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make install</code></strong>, and press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. You will then be prompted for your password. After typing it and pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>, the installation process will take place. Once your Terminal brings you back to your user prompt, Xmahjongg will be installed and ready to run. As a general rule, programs compiled from source do not automatically install a launcher in your Applications menu; you must instead run them by command. Although you can run a program for the first time by typing a command in the Run Application panel applet, it is better to run the program for the first time by typing the command in your Terminal window. If anything has gone amiss during installation, the Terminal will tell you what the problem is, whereas the Run Application method would just leave you wondering what's going on.</p><p>To run Xmahjongg, just type <strong class="userinput"><code>xmahjongg</code></strong> in a Terminal window, and then press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. If everything goes as it should, you can then create a program launcher for Xmahjongg in your Applications menu, on the GNOME Panel, or in a panel drawer.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="9D-5: Cleaning Up and/or Uninstalling Xmahjongg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d-5_colon_cleaning_up_and_solidus_or_uni"/>9D-5: Cleaning Up and/or Uninstalling Xmahjongg</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you are done and everything seems to be working as it should, you would normally tidy things up in the Xmahjongg folder by getting rid of any unnecessary files. You can do this via the Terminal by using the <code class="literal">cd</code> command to go back into the Xmahjongg folder, typing <strong class="userinput"><code>make clean</code></strong>, and then pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-9-0988" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0989" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0990" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0991" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0992" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0993" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0994" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0995" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-9-0996" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you want to uninstall Xmahjongg, open a Terminal window, go back to the Xmahjongg folder by using the <code class="literal">cd</code> command, type <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make uninstall</code></strong>, and finally press <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span>. The routine is essentially the same for any applications installed in this way, though as you might imagine, uninstallation isn't always as smooth a process as what I've just described (and it's definitely not as easy as it is via the Ubuntu Software Center).</p><p>The main reason for the uninstallation process being less than cooperative is that the <code class="literal">make uninstall</code> routine requires you to keep the original project folder, which means you have to keep a bit of clutter you normally wouldn't need to bother with. On top of this, some projects do not provide a <code class="literal">make uninstall</code> routine at all. This means that you have to keep track of where everything has been installed in your system and then remove each item using a series of <code class="literal">sudo rm</code> commands.</p><p>All that negativity aside, go ahead, have some fun, and put your command-line skills to the test. You'll have something to tell your grandkids about in the future.</p></div></div>
