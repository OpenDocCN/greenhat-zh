    It’s not that everyone on the Internet is trying to attack you, but there’s always
    *someone* who wants to break into your system. Even if you think you have nothing
    of value, someone wants to own your computer. And you won’t realize the value

    to run its business. The company was forbidden to compete in the computer industry,
    so it could not sell this software. Instead, AT&T licensed its software and the
    related source code to universities for nominal sums. Universities saved money
    by using this software instead of commercial equivalents with pricey licenses,
    and university students got access to this nifty technology and could learn how
    everything worked. In return, AT&T got exposure, some pocket change, and a generation
    of computer scientists who had cut their teeth on AT&T technology. Everyone got
    something out of the deal.

    Thousands of students had access to its source code, however, and hundreds of
    teachers needed interesting projects for their students. If a program behaved
    oddly, or the operating system itself had a problem, the people who lived with
    the system had the tools and the motivation to fix it. Their efforts quickly improved
    UNIX and created many features we now take for granted. Students added the ability
    to control running processes, also known as *job control*. The UNIX S51K filesystem
    made system administrators wail and gnash their teeth, so they replaced it with
    the Fast File System (FFS), which introduced a whole host of features that have
    crept into every modern filesystem. Over the years, many small, useful programs
    were added to UNIX, and entire subsystems were replaced.

    Berkeley, acted as a central clearinghouse for UNIX code improvements from 1979
    to 1994\. The group collected changes from other universities, evaluated them,
    packaged them, and distributed the compilation for free to anyone with a valid
    AT&T UNIX license. The CSRG also contracted with the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency (DARPA) to implement various features in UNIX, such as TCP/IP.
    The resulting software collection came to be known as the Berkeley Software Distribution,
    or BSD. Users took the CSRG’s software, improved it further, and fed their improvements
    back into the CSRG. Today, we consider this a fairly standard way to run an open
    source project, but in 1979, it was revolutionary.

    predictable, and secure. However, many free software producers are satisfied if
    their code compiles and simply seems to work, and quite a few commercial software
    companies don’t give their programmers time to write their code correctly.
  prefs: []

- en: OpenBSD developers strive to implement solutions correctly. They make it a strict
    rule to write programs in a reliable and secure manner, following best current
    programming practices. And exposing the code to “weird” environments such as ancient
    VAXes is part of the discipline; OpenBSD developers insist that some subtle bugs
    (and a few less subtle ones) have been pinpointed only during testing on one of
    OpenBSD’s less mainstream architectures. Fixing those bugs benefits all users,
    of course.

    System Interface (POSIX) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
    but they are less concerned about extensions to these standards created by third
    parties. For example, many Linux extensions do not appear in OpenBSD. When those
    extensions are added to standards, the OpenBSD team will add them.

    politely, and often with constructive criticism, but turned away nonetheless.

- en: OpenBSD strives to be the most secure operating system in the world. While it
    can reasonably make that claim today, maintaining that position requires constant
    effort. Intruders constantly try new ways to penetrate computers, which means
    that today’s feature might be tomorrow’s security problem. As OpenBSD developers
    learn of new classes of programming errors and security holes, they scan the entire
    source tree for that type of problem and make fixes before anyone even knows how
    these issues *might* be exploited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, OpenBSD takes advantage of any security features offered by hardware.
    For example, AMD’s 64-bit Intel-compatible CPUs can mark a page of memory as either
    executable or writable, but not both. (Intel later copied this feature.) This
    alleviates many buffer overflow attacks, but the operating system must use this
    facility. OpenBSD supported this feature in 2003, shortly after the hardware was
    released. In fact, OpenBSD generally supports all hardware security features offered
    on a platform.
  prefs: []

    This might seem contradictory, but in truth, it means that the person running

    features secure everything running on the system. That’s just not possible. No
    operating system can defend itself against operator error. An operating system
    can protect itself from software problems to a limited extent, but ultimately,
    the responsibility for security is the administrator’s.

    OpenBSD provides the web server with a stable, reliable platform, and will provide
    services as the web server requests, within the limits assigned by the system
    administrator. If the system administrator has configured the web server correctly,
    a web server failure will not endanger the operating system. If the system administrator
    configures the web server to run with unlimited privileges, the web server can
    inflict almost unrestricted damage on the underlying system.

    but suppose you install insecure forum software. An intruder can break into the
    forum and edit its data—maybe grab the username and password the forum software
    uses to access the local database. If that account information matches a system-level
    username and password, the intruder might be able to leverage them to gain access
    to the system. Or perhaps he can use that username and password to get administrator-level
    access to the database and penetrate other applications. What if those applications
    have elevated privileges?

    have handy wizards that walk you through each stage of the configuration process,

    the system works, though, such wizards would only get in the way.
