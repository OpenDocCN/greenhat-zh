    you do have to make sure that your printer is supported. Fortunately, it seems
    that printer support in the Linux world is getting much, much better than it once
    was. In general, support for Epson and Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers is pretty
    good, while support for other makers and other printer types is a bit spottier.

    why wouldn’t you?), the best thing to do is probably to go to [www.linuxprinting.org.](http://www.linuxprinting.org)
    On that site, you can check out the online database to see if your printer is
    currently supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers
    also include information on what drivers are best for your purposes. If you’re
    thinking of buying a printer, there is also a page of suggested makes and models.

    white draft documents that you only need to print at a 300 dpi resolution, but
    once you are done fixing them up, you want to print and send them to other people
    at a higher quality, such as 600 dpi. And when you aren’t writing up business
    documents, you love to print out high-quality photos that you took on your digital
    camera, but before printing out the final version, you like to preview them at
    a lower, and faster-printing, resolution. Satisfying all these needs would require
    a lot of trips to the Edit window, and that just will not do.

    only one printer, you can create a variety of print queues, each with its own
    set of driver preferences. These function like a series of virtual printers, from
    which you can freely choose. The original queue you created is most likely a 300
    dpi, color and B/W cartridge, letter-page-size setup. You can, however, add other
    queues that have different configurations in terms of color choice, print resolution,
    and even paper size.

    select the queue I want to use from the print dialog box of a program like OpenOffice.

    ways to do it, but I will tell you the easiest one. Once you create a few queues
    of your own, all you need to do is open the Print Manager by clicking the printer
    icon in the left portion of the GNOME Panel. When you do this, you will be able
    to see your print queues, each shown in the form of a printer icon in the GNOME
    Print Manager window. In my case, my present default is Color300, but I am going
    to change the default to Gray300\. To do this, I simply right-click **Gray300**
    and select **Set as Default** in the pop-up menu. Gray300 now has a check mark
    on it to indicate that it is the default print queue, as you can see in [Figure
