    appliance is SNMP. Any corporation with a large network will use Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP) as part of its network- and system-management solution.

    markets without SNMP support on your appliance.

    amounts of information over a network, like single numbers and character strings.
    You would not use SNMP for large volumes of data, like file transfer.'
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A read operation in SNMP is called a GET, while a write is called a SET. The
    target of a SET or GET operation is called an object. An *object* is like a field
    in a database record.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SNMP treats objects as if they were organized into a single large database called
    the *Management Information Base (MIB).* It may be helpful to think of SNMP as
    an API to the information on a device. It hides the details of object retrieval
    beneath an organized hierarchical namespace. An SNMP agent on each system provides
    this API. The *agent is* a background (daemon) process listening for SNMP requests
    on UDP port 161\. Beneath the API, the agent may interact with the kernel or some
    application process running on the system; it may also read several pieces of
    information from different sources and apply a mathematical formula to furnish
    the value defined in a MIB. An object in the MIB may also represent functionality
    rather than data; for example, setting a MIB object to a particular value might
    trigger a reboot or the restarting of a service.

- en: MIB files describe portions of the complete MIB database. Typically, each MIB
    file describes a *MIB module,* which is a subtree of the overall database. MIB
    files are both human readable and program readable. They document the MIB for
    humans, and they provide a means for programs to translate between these number
    strings and their human-readable names. Although we have talked about *the MIB*
    as the SNMP-addressable universe, the more common use of the term *MIB* is for
    one of these named subtrees. For example, you will hear talk of the *Host Resources
    MIB,* or the *HP Printer MIB,* or *MIB-2.* These are all subtrees, but they are
    also all addressable within the overall namespace.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First and foremost among MIBs is the cryptically named *MIB-II.* When SNMP was
    first created, the SNMP working group of the IETF defined a core set of information.
    This was the first MIB, or *MIB-I.* A few years later, the SNMP WG revised this
    core set and it became *MIB-II.* We use *MIB-2,* rather than MIB-II, in this chapter
    to match the name used in the MIB file that defines this MIB.

    along in this chapter. Net-SNMP will provide you with commands (snmpget, snmpset,
    snmpwalk, snmptrap), an SNMP agent, and the standard MIB files. Normally, the
    commands and agent would be running on different systems, but for simplicity you’ll
    be running both on the same system. If you have two systems available, you can
    perform the full installation on both systems; then you can run snmpget, for example,
    on one system, and talk to the agent on the other. If you use two systems, remember
    to change all instances of localhost or 127.0.0.1 in this chapter’s code to the
    name or address of the system running the SNMP agent.

    common Linux distributions provide some version of it. If you have a very old
    Linux distribution (like Red Hat 7.*x*) you may find UCD-SNMP instead; this is
    an older version—or parent—of Net-SNMP. Although its behavior is very similar
    to that of Net-SNMP, there are enough differences to confuse someone trying to
    follow this tutorial; you should remove it, and follow the instructions here to
    install Net-SNMP. If you find some other package installed, definitely remove
    it before continuing.

    closer your version of Net-SNMP is to the one used in this chapter (version 5.2.1),
    the closer your results will be to the ones shown here.

    it indicates *daemon*—our agent. Do not confuse this with snmp.conf, which we

    side and *agent* for the server side. The agent serves up the data on the appliance,

    of the sysLocation variable, which you configured in your snmpd.conf file. The
    .0 appended to the sysLocation name is SNMP’s way of indicating that you want
    the *instance* of this variable. In object-oriented language, think of sysLocation
    as a class that has one instance. If this were an array (table) of locations,
    the .0 would be replaced by the row number of the variable (.1, .2, .3, and so
    on). Row numbers always start with 1, so there is no confusion between a row index
    and a scalar indicator.

    snmpwalk uses multiple SNMP GETNEXT PDUs to “walk” an entire MIB. You pick a starting
    point, and snmpwalk asks for the lexically next object instance; the agent returns
    that object and its OID, and snmpwalk asks for the next object instance after
    the new OID. Eventually, the agent responds that there is nothing more to return,

- en: In SNMP, the term *group* refers to a subdivision of a MIB consisting of a collection
    of objects or tables that are related in some way. For example, MIB-2’s UPD and
    TCP groups are all about UDP and TCP traffic, respectively. The Net-SNMP agent
    can be built to support a variety of MIBs, but you can always expect to find the
    MIB-2 groups system, interfaces, ip, icmp, tcp, udp, and snmp. These are not all
    of the groups defined in MIB-2, but they are the ones most likely to be supported
    by any SNMP agent. Figure 13-1 shows the location of MIB-2 in the overall MIB
    address space and breaks out some of the groups that comprise MIB-2\. Also notice
    the location of the private.enterprises branch. That’s where you can find the
    HP Printer MIB objects you saw earlier.

- en: ⁹ You need to be logged in as root because the command will want to write to
    /var/net-snmp/ snmpapp.conf, which is the persistent data storage. As of Net-SNMP
    5.3, it appears to want to write an SNMPv3 engine ID there, even though we are
    not using SNMPv3 here. (SNMPv3 is not covered in this book.)

  zh: ⁹ 您需要以 root 用户登录，因为命令将想要写入到 /var/net-snmp/ snmpapp.conf，这是持久数据存储。截至 Net-SNMP
    5.3，它似乎想要在那里写入一个 SNMPv3 引擎 ID，尽管我们在这里并没有使用 SNMPv3。（SNMPv3 在本书中未涉及。）
