When you place a telephone call, the PSTN creates a direct link between your phone and the phone assigned to the unique telephone number you requested. The telephone industry calls this kind of basic connection <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1695"/>POTS (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1696"/>plain old telephone service, pronounced like <span class="emphasis"><em>pots</em></span> and pans). The Internet is a separate system that uses a different set of rules and methods to connect computers to one another. Computer data (including digital audio) does not require a continuous connection, so Internet connections can use packet switching (as described in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKING">Chapter 1</a>) to move data more quickly and more efficiently than the older PSTN.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1697"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1698"/></p><p>When you connect a telephone or a microphone to a computer and convert the sound of your voice to a sequence of digital packets, you can send those packets through the Internet to a specific destination, where the recipient's computer converts the packets back into an analog audio stream and plays the audio through a speaker or a telephone handset. The technology that moves voice communication through the Internet is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1699"/></p><p>If the recipient of your call has a computer connected to the Internet, you can completely bypass the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1700"/>PSTN and route the call through the Internet, using the recipient's Internet address to identify the call's destination. But it's also possible to transfer a call between the Internet and the PSTN in either direction. You can originate a call on the Internet and direct it to the PSTN, or you can use your <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1701"/>POTS line to call a phone attached to a computer.</p><p>There are several possible ways to use VoIP:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Place a computer-to-computer call entirely through the Internet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Originate a call on a computer connected to the Internet and transfer it to the PSTN as close to the destination as possible, then complete the call to the recipient's telephone line.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Originate a call on a telephone line and call a local VoIP service provider, then connect through the Internet to the recipient's computer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Originate a call on a telephone line, connect to a local VoIP provider, then connect the call through the Internet to a distant VoIP center, where it transfers back to the PSTN and on to the recipient's telephone line.</p></li></ul></div><p>VoIP offers several possible advantages over calling through the traditional telephone system. First, it's often significantly cheaper because there are no toll charges for long distance calls. Second, in places where telephone service is not reliable, the Internet's error-correcting packet data switching can sometimes provide connections with better sound and fewer dropped calls than a bad telephone line (but the emphasis is on <span class="emphasis"><em>sometimes</em></span>—just as often, a POTS call will be clearer than VoIP). And third, it's possible to use VoIP through a Wi-Fi or broadband wireless link in places where a conventional telephone line or mobile telephone signal might not be available.</p><p>On the other hand, VoIP is often less reliable and less consistent than the PSTN because VoIP packets (and other live audio or video streams) can be interrupted or delayed by all the sources of interference and noise that other data ignores. It makes no difference if your email message takes several minutes to arrive, but you expect a phone call to reach its recipient <span class="emphasis"><em>right now</em></span>. And the sound quality of VoIP calls can sometimes be noticeably worse than a call through the PSTN. In practice, the reduced cost of long distance calls is generally the most compelling reason to use VoIP.</p><p>Dozens of service providers offer local or long distance telephone services that use VoIP instead of the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1702"/>old PSTN. Some are marketed as alternatives to the local dial tone company, others are low-cost worldwide long distance services, and still others offer a local telephone number in one or more distant locations, so people who call you don't have to pay long distance charges. You can find <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1703"/>directories and user reviews of VoIP services at several websites, including <a class="ulink" href="http://www.voipreview.org">http://www.voipreview.org</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.voip-info.org">http://www.voip-info.org</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.voipmonitor.net/VoIP+Providers.aspx">http://www.voipmonitor.net/VoIP+Providers.aspx</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-32"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>There are two important safety issues related to VoIP telephone calls. Even if your VoIP phone or portable computer runs on batteries, the access point and the Internet gateway almost certainly use domestic AC power; if your electricity fails, you won't be able to use your VoIP telephone, but a conventional telephone will probably continue to work. And VoIP networks create special challenges when you call 911 (or the comparable telephone number in your country) in an emergency because a VoIP call to 911 might not connect you to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), or if it does, it might not accurately transmit your telephone number and address to the PSAP operator</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1704"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1705"/></p></div><p>There are many ways to use VoIP, but this is a book about broadband wireless, so we'll limit this discussion to VoIP services that use Wi-Fi or broadband data services to connect to the Internet. These services fall into two categories: software and services that allow a user to originate telephone calls from a portable computer or PDA using Wi-Fi or broadband wireless data networks, and wireless voice over Wi-Fi telephones that use Wi-Fi links to send and receive VoIP calls through the Internet. You don't need Wi-Fi or broadband wireless to use VoIP, but if wireless is part of your arsenal of Internet connection tools, you should know that VoIP is available and that the two technologies can work together.</p><div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="voip_over_broadband_wireless_and_wimax"/>VoIP over Broadband Wireless and WiMAX</h1></div></div></div><p>Any VoIP service that can place telephone calls through the Internet can use a portable computer with a broadband wireless connection to originate those calls.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1706"/></p><p>In general, the process goes something like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Attach a microphone and a speaker or earpiece to the computer (or use the computer's internal microphone and speakers).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open up a wireless connection to the Internet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use a web browser or the wireless service provider's control program to log in.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use the VoIP service provider's software to place a telephone call.</p></li></ol></div><p>After the computer has established its connection to the Internet, the VoIP software treats the connection just like any other Internet link. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1707"/>For example, <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#skype_offers_calling_software_for_window" title="Figure 16-1. Skype offers calling software for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.">Figure 16-1</a> shows the Skype calling screens for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.

Each of them has organized its call origination software differently and each has a different pricing plan, so you might want to compare several before you commit to a long-term subscription. The reviews at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.voipreview.org">http://www.voipreview.org</a> can tell you about other users' experiences with many providers.</p><p>To receive calls through your VoIP account, you must choose an area code and telephone number from your VoIP service provider's website and follow their instructions for setting up an inbound account. A VoIP telephone number is just like any other phone number, so anybody with a telephone can use that number to call you. Most service providers either charge a flat rate for unlimited inbound calls, or they charge a few pennies per minute or per call.</p><p>You don't have to choose a telephone number based in your local area code or even in your own country. If you have customers or friends (or both) in a distant location, you can choose one or more numbers that allow them to reach you with a local call. For example, if you live in California, and you have family in Hong Kong, England, and Canada, you could choose local telephone numbers for your VoIP account based in Hong Kong, London, and Vancouver and allow your relatives to reach you without the need to place expensive international long distance calls.</p><p>Remember that you can only receive incoming calls through a wireless link when the link is active. Unlike a wired DSL or cable modem connection, your Wi-Fi or broadband data connection is only alive when the wireless control program is running. Therefore, if you expect to receive calls to your VoIP number, you will probably want to subscribe to your service provider's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-16-1713"/>voicemail service.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-33"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be sure to compare the real cost of VoIP service to your existing cell phone charges. If you already have both a mobile telephone and a broadband data account from the same service provider, there might not be any real advantage to using VoIP instead of your mobile phone. The mobile service provider uses the same base stations for both services, so you probably won't find wireless data coverage in places where your phone doesn't work. And if your mobile telephone billing plan includes long distance calls at no extra cost, VoIP might not offer any real savings</em></span>.</p></div></div></div>
