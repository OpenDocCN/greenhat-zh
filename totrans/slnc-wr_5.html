I have taken pride in guiding you through the world of complex and uncommon security problems that I most enjoy, and I hope you have shared my passion. Whether you are a seasoned security professional—perhaps more experienced and knowledgeable than I—or just an enthusiast discovering this field, I hope that I have given you a new perspective on security, as a challenge and art all its own, not a set of obstacles that must be eliminated or worked around.</p><p>By understanding the subtle relationships between seemingly unrelated components and processes, you can effectively tackle the most dangerous and pervasive security problems and assess and mitigate everyday risks more efficiently. Security problems should be seen as a function of a solution to virtually every challenge in the world of IT, no matter how trivial or limited in scope; not as the adverse circumstances of doing business. Only by seeing the magic and charm of the complementary universes and the subtle ways they interact can we avoid routine and begin to really enjoy our work, or understand our hobby.</p><p>But then it is not the right time or place to hit high notes.</p><p>Thank you for playing.</p></div></body></html>
