Computers running Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X can all support Wi-Fi, if you can find the driver software for your network adapter. A TCP/IP network doesn't care what kind of operating system the computers connected to the network are using. It's just receiving bits and bytes from a computer port and moving them around. All of the most popular versions and distributions of both Linux and Unix (including Mac OS X) include wireless networking configuration and control tools that perform the same functions as the Windows utilities described in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. WI-FI FOR WINDOWS">Chapter 6</a>. This chapter contains information about connecting your Unix- and Linux-based computer to a Wi-Fi network, and it describes some utilities and other tools that can make things easier.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0647"/></p><p>If you're not already using Unix or Linux, connecting to a wireless network is not a good enough reason to start. There are some Linux and Unix tools <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0648"/>for measuring the performance <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0649"/>of a Wi-Fi network and for cracking wireless encryption that aren't available for Windows, but unless you're a network manager, you probably don't have any real need for them.</p><p>This chapter is written for Unix and Linux users who already have enough experience to set up and use one of those operating systems on a laptop or desktop computer. If you need more <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0650"/>help using your Unix or Linux clients, you should ask for help from your neighborhood guru or find a more general how to use Linux or Unix book, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu for Non-Geeks, 2nd Edition</em></span> by Rickford Grant (2007, No Starch Press) or <span class="emphasis"><em>Absolute FreeBSD, 2nd Edition</em></span> by Michael W. Lucas (2008, No Starch Press).<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0651"/></p><p>Many <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0652"/>Linux and Unix distributions for desktop and laptop computers (rather than servers), including Ubuntu, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0653"/>openSUSE, and <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0654"/>PC-BSD (among others) include drivers and control software that support many common Wi-Fi adapters, so a computer running one of those distributions will probably detect and connect to a nearby wireless signal automatically. If you're using one of those distributions with a supported adapter, you can just turn on the computer, plug in the adapter, and go. But if your distribution doesn't include Wi-Fi drivers and utilities, or if you have a less common adapter, you'll have to find the driver and control software separately. You can find pointers to many sources for those drivers later in this chapter.</p><p>If you're not satisfied with the Wi-Fi control program supplied with your Linux or Unix distribution, or if your distribution doesn't include a Wi-Fi program, you can choose from several other Wi-Fi control programs that perform the same actions as the built-in control programs but present them differently. There's a list of these programs later in this chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note-15"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you're operating a Unix or Linux network server, it's better to locate the server in the same room and use Ethernet cables to connect the server to the network router, instead of wireless links.

Later in this chapter, you can find advice about finding the right drivers for different kinds of wireless network adapters and how to use them to connect Unix and Linux computers to a wireless network.</p><p>A device driver is the software interface between a computer's operating system and the inputs and outputs of a peripheral device connected to the computer. The driver contains the instructions that translate incoming commands and data from the device into a form that the operating system can understand, and it translates outbound instructions from the operating system into specific device controls. It handles memory management and timing, and it specifies the input/output (I/O) port and the interrupts that the device will use to communicate with the operating system. <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#a_device_driver_is_the_data_and_control_" title="Figure 7-1. A device driver is the data and control interface between a computer and a peripheral device.">Figure 7-1</a> shows the relationship between a computer and a very generic <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0656"/>device driver.</p><div class="figure"><a id="a_device_driver_is_the_data_and_control_"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7120"/><img alt="A device driver is the data and control interface between a computer and a peripheral device." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254083.png"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 7-1. A device driver is the data and control interface between a computer and a peripheral device.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Every peripheral device, including a wireless network adapter, requires a driver that converts standard instructions from the computer to controls that handle the specific features and functions <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0657"/>of that device. Without the driver, the device won't operate. A device without the right driver is useful only as a paperweight or a doorstop.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0658"/></p><p>So, for example, the driver for a keyboard tells the computer which I/O port carries data to and from the keyboard, converts keystrokes into input data, and turns the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock lights on or off. A printer driver includes the specific controls that make the difference between an impact printer and a laser printer. A driver for an input or output device will specify whether the device uses a serial or parallel port, a USB port, a PCMCIA socket, or one of the internal expansion slots on the computer's motherboard. And the driver for a wireless network adapter specifies things like the channel number that the radio will use to send and receive data, the amount of power the radio will transmit, and the data transmission speed that the adapter will use to transfer data.</p><p>The drivers for Wi-Fi adapters handle the physical layers of TCP/IP communication—just the information the adapters need to set up and use radio links to a network, while other layers handle data formatting and content. This assures that the adapter can handle many data formats and the data can pass through many different adapter types.</p><p>Drivers also make it possible for the same piece of hardware to work with different operating systems. A driver converts the input and output signals produced by the operating system to and from commands in the device's "native language." Drivers written for different operating systems that control the same device start with instructions in different forms, and convert those instructions into the same set of device controls. Therefore, your computer requires <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0659"/>device drivers written specifically for that operating system.</p><p>It might be useful to think of a driver as the instruction manual for a device. Manuals written in English, Dutch, and Malay all contain the same set of instructions, but they are provided in languages that different users will understand. Computer <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0660"/>device drivers are similar, except the languages are operating systems instead of human speech.</p><p>The device driver is a separate program from the configuration utility, but many software designers combine the two in a single installation. The configuration utility provides a set of commands and displays that send and receive data in both directions through the driver to the network adapter.</p><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="where_to_find_drivers"/>Where to Find Drivers</h2></div></div></div><p>You need a driver for your computer's operating system before you can use your wireless network adapter. If you're lucky, or if you have done some careful shopping, the right driver is either on the CD supplied with the adapter, or it's bundled with the operating system. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0661"/>For Linux and Unix systems, most drivers are already built into the core, or kernel, of the operating system.</p><p>Many wireless adapters are actually <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0662"/>private-label products that were made by somebody whose name does not appear anywhere on the package or the device itself. So it's often necessary to do some detective work to identify the right driver for a particular adapter. <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0663"/>Proxim and Atheros are particularly active in the private-label adapter business. The adapter manufacturers might not want to tell you whose hardware is lurking inside their boxes, but the people who develop third-party Linux drivers have often figured out which brands work with which drivers.</p><p>The first place to look for a Linux or Unix adapter is in the operating system core itself. Generally speaking, the most stable and well-supported drivers will have been merged into the kernel development process. Most distributions will turn on all the stable drivers by default, but it might be necessary to recompile your kernel in some situations.</p><p>If you have a choice, it's better to pick an adapter that is already supported by your operating system. Some manufacturers provide the necessary specifications to write complete drivers, or they have written and contributed drivers themselves. Other manufacturers offer no official support for Linux and BSD, but dedicated individuals have written drivers by painstakingly reverse engineering the official drivers from other platforms. The final option for users trying to get an adapter functioning is to use a <span class="emphasis"><em>wrapper</em></span> framework, which takes a Windows device driver and wraps it in code that makes it act like a driver for Linux or Unix.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0664"/></p><p>Adapter manufacturers who have produced their own Linux and Unix drivers, or who have worked with the open source community to provide official specifications, have generally done a good job of supporting devices and making drivers available to users. Several major vendors, however, provide no such support or assistance. If you already have an adapter that will not support Linux or Unix, you will probably have to move from the relatively sane world of commercial software to the wide-open universe of <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0665"/>user groups, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0666"/>email lists, and community websites. Communities of users are out there, made up of people who are anxious to improve the performance and compatibility of their favorite operating systems. Within these communities, dozens of open source developers have created <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0667"/>device drivers and wireless configuration utilities.</p></div><div class="sect2" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="linux_drivers"/>Linux Drivers</h2></div></div></div><p>More than a hundred different brands of wireless network adapters carry Wi-Fi certification labels, but almost all of them use one of just a handful of internal <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0668"/>chip sets. If you can't find a Linux or Unix driver for a specific card, you can often use a generic driver for the adapter's chip set.</p><p>As Linux becomes more popular, a growing number of companies will provide their own Linux drivers <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0669"/>for their wireless network adapters. If you can't find a Linux driver from your adapter maker, you can probably use one of the drivers supplied in Linux distribution packages, or you can download a separate driver from the chip set provider or a third-party developer.</p><p>One very good place to find Linux drivers is the Linux <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0670"/>Wireless LAN Support website at <a class="ulink" href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl">http://linux-wless.passys.nl</a>. As <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#the_linux_wireless_lan_support_website_p" title="Figure 7-2. The Linux Wireless LAN Support website provides a wealth of useful information about Wi-Fi adapters and drivers.">Figure 7-2</a> shows, this site provides a search tool that you can use to identify the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0671"/>chip set in your adapter and find a direct link to a driver.</p><div class="figure"><a id="the_linux_wireless_lan_support_website_p"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject7_d1e7240"/><img alt="The Linux Wireless LAN Support website provides a wealth of useful information about Wi-Fi adapters and drivers." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254351.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 7-2. The Linux Wireless LAN Support website provides a wealth of useful information about Wi-Fi adapters and drivers.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>To find a driver for your adapter, use one of the search menus on the first page of the Linux Wireless LAN Support site to open either a list of adapters made by each manufacturer or a list of interfaces sorted by the type of interface that the adapter uses to connect to your computer (most often either PCMCIA or USB). The listing for each make and model or each chip set includes a direct link to a driver for that <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0672"/>device.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0673"/></p><p>If you can't find a driver for your adapter on one of those lists, your best bet is to ask for help. The Linux community is famous for assisting new users. Somebody who knows which driver will work with your Whoopie-Matic Lightning Bolt Wireless Adapter has probably posted pointers to exactly the information you need in a Linux newsgroup. The <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0674"/>comp.os.linux.networking newsgroup is the best place to ask questions about finding drivers for wireless network adapters. Before posting your own questions, it's always a good idea to scan the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0675"/>newsgroup's <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0676"/>archives for previous answers that will solve your problem. Look in the comp.os.linux section of <a class="ulink" href="http://groups.google.com">groups.google.com</a> for a searchable archive of old questions and answers.</p><p>If none of those sources can tell you where to find a Linux driver for a specific make and model of adapter, the next step is to identify the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0677"/>chip set inside the adapter and find a driver for that chip set. Some adapters come with data sheets or manuals that identify the chip set, but if yours does not, open a console and try one of these commands:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If the adapter connects to the computer through a USB port, use <code class="literal">lsusb</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the adapter is a 32-bit PC Card (a CardBus card), use <code class="literal">lspci</code>
.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the adapter is an older 16-bit PC Card, use <code class="literal">pccardctl ident</code>
.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the adapter is mounted inside a desktop computer on a PCI card, use <code class="literal">lspci</code>.</p></li></ul></div><p>After you connect the adapter, look at the kernel messages via <code class="literal">dmesg</code> to see if additional information is available.</p><p>As a last resort, you can almost always identify the chip set by entering the FCC <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0678"/>ID code from the adapter's label into the Federal Communications Commission's FCC <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0679"/>Equipment Authorization System Generic Search form at <a class="ulink" href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm</a>. This web page provides links to a database with copies of the paperwork that the manufacturer filed with its application for type approval, usually including a technical description and one or more circuit diagrams. A few minutes reading those documents should tell you who made the adapter's chip set, which should be enough to let you find the applicable driver at the Linux Wireless LAN Support website.</p><p>If you can't find a driver for your adapter in the Linux Wireless LAN Support list or any other source, there are two other last resort alternatives that convert <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0680"/>Windows drivers to Linux. The first is a free program called <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-7-0681"/>NDISwrapper that wraps Linux support around the manufacturer's Windows driver.

In practice, if the kernel recognizes the card, and if the adapter settings match the settings for the access point and other adapters in the same network, you should be able to connect without any trouble. If the kernel doesn't find the card, rebuild the kernel.</p><p>When you set up a new connection, it's easier to enter each option as a separate command than to try to run a whole string at one time. Here are the commands that you will use most often:</p><table border="0" class="simplelist" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><strong class="userinput"><code>wiconfig -p 1</code></strong> Set the network client to operate in infrastructure mode with one or more access points</td></tr><tr><td><strong class="userinput"><code>wiconfig -s Sally's Laptop</code></strong> Identify the network node as "Sally's Laptop"</td></tr><tr><td><strong class="userinput"><code>wiconfig -e 1</code></strong> Turn on WEP encryption</td></tr><tr><td><strong class="userinput"><code>wiconfig -k [WEP key]</code></strong> Set the WEP encryption key</td></tr></table><p>Along with the wireless settings, it's also necessary to set the standard network configuration options that apply to any TCP/IP connection. The <code class="literal">ifconfig</code>
 command handles these settings in most Unix versions.</p><p>After you have configured your wireless network adapter and your network connection, they will operate just like any other network connection. You can run network utilities like ping, web browsers, email clients, and other applications, and you can connect to network resources just as you would over a wired connection.<a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm7_d1e8419"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm7_d1e8424"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm7_d1e8429"/><a class="indexterm" id="I_indexterm7_d1e8432"/></p></div></div></body></html>
