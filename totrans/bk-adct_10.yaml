    should I, when I already own mass quantities of CDs and my own recorded music?
    I don’t even like cell phones. When I leave home, I don’t want an electronic leash.
    If I crash into the ditch, someone will find me eventually, and who’s to say if
    I could even reach a phone when I’m hanging upside down in a mangled vehicle?
    It’s really okay to be unconnected once in a while.

    I like. Mobile phone owners love to have customized ringtones and to use their
    mobile devices as music players (that they can play loudly on their tinny lo-fi
    speakers in public places and annoy grumps like me). Most mobile service providers
    make it a matter of personal honor to charge customers for every last thing they
    can do with their phones, including ringtones and file transfers. So, you might
    say to yourself, fine, I’ll just search online for free ringtones. Be careful—most
    of the “free” sites are come-ons for pay services and sometimes malware. There
    are some legitimate online sources for free ringtones; some of them are mediocre
    amateur efforts, and some are good. In this era of the Wild Wild Internet, shop
    carefully and be on guard.

    it be to make your own ringtones and phone-friendly tunes? Not hard at all. Making
    the actual audio files is easy. The hard part is figuring out what audio file
    formats your phone supports and then how to transfer files into it. So let’s use
    Audacity to create phone-friendly audio files and then look at different ways
    of transferring files into your phone. You’re going to need your phone’s manual
    or any relevant technical information you can dig up. If you don’t have a manual,
    look on your phone manufacturer’s website.

    select a 20- or 30-second portion of the track to use. Here is a slick trick for
    precisely measuring your selection length: Position the Selection tool at the
    beginning of your clip. Go to the Selection toolbar, select the “Length” radio
    button, make sure “Snap To” is not checked, and enter how many seconds long you
    want your clip to be. If you’re a bit shaky with the mouse, you can use the arrow

    cut away the excess. Do any other edits you want, such as fixing problems, boosting
    the volume, applying special effects, or whatever you desire. A good trick is
    to fire up Audacity’s equalizer to shorten the tone curve because your phone speaker
    has a limited frequency range, which you can find in its specs. Equalizing your
    audio file to match your phone speaker’s frequency range will make it sound fuller
    and less tinny. This also makes it sound better in earbuds and Bluetooth headsets.

- en: For example, suppose your phone speaker has a range of 500 to 10,000 Hz. In
    comparison, the full range of human hearing is about 20 to 22,000 Hz. Reduce the
    frequencies outside this range by 24 dB using **Effect** > **Equalization**. The
    equalizer has two sets of controls; you may use either the graphical curve or
    the interface that looks like a hi-fi equalizer. Select “Graphic EQ” to display
    the equalizer ([Figure 10-2](ch10.html#the_graphic_eq_view_has_sliders_for_cont
    "Figure 10-2. The Graphic EQ view has sliders for controlling the frequencies.")).
    The equalizer sliders max out at a 20 dB range, while the curve has a range of
    120 dB. A reduction of -60 dB is well beyond what we can hear and is as good as
    absolute silence.

    actually use, which is affected by the limitations of the equalization algorithm.
    If the green line and blue line diverge significantly, increase the Length of

    using the phone’s menu. This creates the right type of filesystem for your phone.
    Your phone’s manual will tell you how. Formatting the storage card erases everything
    on it.

    it into your computer, copy over your new ringtones, and then stuff the card into
    your phone and transfer the files to the correct directory. Your phone might even
    have some helpful menu options to make this easy.

- en: 'Bluetooth is another common option for connecting a mobile phone to a PC. It’s
    an odd name for a useful function: very short-range wireless radio networking,
    from 1 to 100 feet. If your computer does not have a Bluetooth adapter, you can
    buy a USB Bluetooth adapter for less than $30\. Get Bluetooth 2.0 because that
    is the newest and fastest standard. To establish a Bluetooth networking connection,
    follow the instructions in your camera’s manual. Typically, you’ll activate Bluetooth
    on your PC, set it to *discovery* mode, and then set up *pairing* with your phone
    from the phone’s menu. If it asks you for a personal identification number (PIN),
    this is usually an arbitrary number that you invent at the time of discovery and
    then duplicate on the computer to complete the connection.'

    they want to overcharge you for online services or charge you extra up front for
    a *data connection kit*, which is a fancy way of saying they want to gouge you
    for uncrippling some of the phone’s built-in functions. [Figure 10-10](ch10s05.html#a_microsd_flash_storage_card_adapter_com

    by purchasing an unlocked phone. You’ll have to figure out for yourself if it’s
    better to go with a branded phone, which is subsidized by the service provider
    and locks you in for a year or two, or to pay full price for the freedom of an
    unlocked phone.

    your ringtones. Photos, contacts, messages, any of the data stored in your phone
    can be backed up to a PC or transferred from a PC to your phone. There are many
    Windows and Apple software applications for managing your mobile phone from your
    computer. These usually cost a few dollars. There is a good open source, free-of-cost
    application worth trying that runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows: BitPim. To quote

    files for your mobile devices and how to add extra storage so you can carry around
    your entire music collection with you. Don’t forget the earbuds. Or even some
    fancy, high-end padded headphones, because your phone speaker might be poo but
    its sound processor just might be pretty good, needing only some good headphones
    to come to life.
