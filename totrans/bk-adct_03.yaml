    legacy medium—vinyl LPs, cassette tapes, reel-to-reel tapes, vintage 78s, videocassettes,
    even eight-track tapes—to CD. Or you can transfer them to a hard drive, solid-state

    to get a nice sideline going doing this. A lot of people are still hanging on
    to their record collections but are afraid to enjoy them because LPs are fragile.

    because the new ones are inferior. Real Discwasher brushes have a directional
    nap—hold them one way to clean the record, and then reverse your stroke on a clean
    lint-free cloth to clean the brush. There is an arrow embedded on the handle that
    points to the leading edge. You can use a real Discwasher brush dry or with a
    wet cleaning solution. The correct way to wet-clean with Discwasher is to apply
    the cleaning solution to the leading edge of the brush only, leaving the rest
    of it dry. You can clean a record on your turntable while it’s rotating, but be
    careful you don’t apply so much pressure that you damage the motor. Apply the
    wet leading edge of the brush for three to four turns, and then roll the brush
    to bring the dry part in contact with the record for another three to four turns.
    Give it time to dry completely before playing it, because playing a wet record
    can damage it. (However, on a record that is already in bad, nothing-to-lose condition,
    playing it wet might make it sound better. Moisten it carefully with distilled
    water or Discwasher D4 fluid, and give it a whirl. It won’t hurt your stylus.)

- en: The earliest recordings were made on rotating wax cylinders with a needle in
    the middle of a vibrating diaphragm attached to a horn, like an old-fashioned
    ear trumpet. The horn functioned like a microphone. The needle vibrations cut
    an uneven groove into the wax. Modern mono recordings were made using the same
    principle of a vibrating needle cutting into a softer material, except the needle
    was moved by a magnet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stereo came about when someone experimented with the angle of the magnet with
    respect to the needle and found that it could be controlled precisely enough to
    cut each side of the groove differently, creating two stereo channels. The technology
    for producing vinyl records, even with the advent of CDs and digital audio, has
    continued to improve, and some record labels are still producing high-quality
    vinyl recordings. With all of these advances, it’s still a single needle doing
    the recording and playback for two channels, which results in a bit of *crosstalk*,
    so precision tuning of your turntable is required to get the best performance.

    records because it will damage them. The earliest records were made of wax, and
    there were many different wax compositions using carnuba, beeswax, and other materials.
    People who know about these things recommend not using liquid cleaners at all.
    If you have vintage records, I recommend consulting experts who know how to handle
    them safely. Solutions containing alcohol are fine for modern vinyl records, and
    most record cleaners contain alcohol. Whatever cleaner you use, it must be something
    that leaves no residue.

    on your stylus. This is less controversial; I use the Stanton SC-4 brush and cleaner,
    and they do the job just fine. Remember, you cannot be too careful when you’re
    handling your turntable’s stylus; handle it as gently as you possibly can by its
    mounting brace only. Never touch it with your fingers.

    cartridges require a mere 0.5 to 3 grams. Medium-quality styli, and those designed
    for DJs, go as high as 5 grams. Set the tracking force per the instructions for
    your particular hardware. Too light and too heavy will both cause too much wear,
    so you really want it just right.

    aligned contact without causing asymmetrical wear. It is worth spending some time
    tuning your turntable, and you may be surprised at how much difference tiny adjustments

    to be in only one channel. This is more characteristic of vinyl because the needle
    is pushed by the groove, so the side pushing the needle inward gets more wear.
    Tapes will also wear unevenly because one track is on the “inside” away from the
    edge of the tape. The track closest to the edge will be affected the most by magnetism,
    electrical fields, and physical damage from the tape guides.

    interpolation to reconstruct the waveform. The Select threshold setting determines
    the sensitivity for deciding when a spike is a scratch. Smaller Select threshold

    value for the Amplification setting, such as -3.0\. One decibel is about the smallest
    level of change we can perceive, and every 3 decibels doubles or, when reducing

    you move them left and less aggressive on the right sides of the scales. A larger
    value for frequency smoothing means it treats a wider range of frequencies as
    the same, so it makes larger changes. *Attack* is how hard a note is hit, and
    *decay* is how long it takes to fade away. Since there is only one Attack/decay
    time slider, the attack and decay times will always be the same. Smaller values
    are more abrupt, and larger values are more gradual.

    hiss or rumble by reducing the amplitude of frequencies below 500 Hz and above
    15,000 Hz. Of course, this will also affect any sounds in this range that you
    want to keep, so it’s not always the best solution, but it is one more thing to
    try. You can try this in any part of the frequency range that contains unwanted
    noise.

    some plug-ins to get high- and low-pass filters for Audacity; look in your Effects

    attenuates the louder frequencies, reducing the difference between the soft and

    on a vinyl LP and boosting frequencies above 2,120 Hz. Vinyl LPs have to be recorded
    this way or the bass grooves would take up most of the album, resulting in short
    playing time, and the higher frequencies would barely be audible. When you play
    a vinyl record, your integrated amplifier or receiver corrects this imbalance
    with a built-in phono preamp that reverses the RIAA curve. It sounds tinny with

    decades-old turntable but a shiny new direct-drive three-speed with its own internal
    phono preamp. That’s right, 33 1/3, 45, and 78\. It’s designed to be a DJ turntable,
    so it comes with an elliptical stylus for playing records both frontward and backward.
    (The horror! As if I would do that to a perfectly good LP!) It has adjustable
    speed, pitch, antiskate, and feet levelers, and it’s weighty and solid as a good
    turntable should be. The internal preamp is switchable, so you can either connect
    it directly to a recording interface or switch off the internal preamp and connect
    to an external phono preamp. If you want to play vintage 78s, you need to purchase
    a special cartridge and stylus, such as the Shure M78S wide-groove monophonic
    cartridge.

    commercially recorded cassettes because of their inferior quality. They used the
    cheapest tape and were plagued with hiss, narrow dynamic range, and overall cruddy
    tone. By the early ’70s, commercially recorded reel tapes were pretty much gone

    audio tapes and LPs, but there were shortcomings with both media, and neither
    one provided a completely satisfactory solution. It’s easier to skip tracks on
    an LP and they’re easier to handle than reel tapes, but it’s nearly impossible
    to keep them clean and undamaged. Neither one holds very much music. A vinyl LP
    holds 16 to 24 minutes per side; modern dance music LPs hold 12 minutes or less
    because of the extreme thumping bass, which creates wider grooves. Don’t even
    suggest using a record changer—those are for people who like having mangled records.
    A 1,200-foot, 7-inch reel of 1/4″ tape, which was common for home recording, holds
    64 minutes per side at 3.75 inches per second (ips) and 32 minutes at 7.5 ips.
    (In comparison, professional recordings were made at 15 and 30 ips.) Neither one
    is easily portable, and you can’t play them in cars.

    among sound quality, portability, and cost, and they were a lot more rugged than
    reel tapes or LPs. You can stop a cassette tape at any point and remove it from
    the machine; you can’t do that very easily with reel tapes. Cassettes for the
    home market travel at 1 7/8 ips, and their tapes are 0.15″ wide. Sound quality
    isn’t equal to that of LPs and reel tapes, but if you have a good recorder and
    use good-quality Type II or IV tape, it is pretty nice. Whenever I bought a new
    vehicle (new to me, that is), the first thing I did was put a good sound system
    in it. I made a lot of long trips because I liked going places, and having a big
    box of music tapes made those trips even more splendid. Cassette tapes came in
    a variety of sizes, and I liked 90-minute cassette tapes because I could get two
    LPs on one tape. A dual-well cassette player with auto-reverse delivered 180 uninterrupted
    minutes of music. Larger sizes, such as 120-minute cassettes, were too thin and
    fragile to use. Thinner tapes stretch; 60-minute, high-quality tapes are thickest
    and suffer the least amount of stretch.

    and I liked to make and exchange mix tapes, because even in my youth oh so long
    ago commercial radio was pretty horrible, just the same Top 20 dreck played over
    and over, with more commercials than music and annoying DJs interrupting the music.
    So, trading mix tapes was a great way to discover new music. Another cool thing
    was we could copy just the songs we wanted and not suffer through the filler that
    plagued so much popular music. Given the continual failures of the music industry
    to deliver what would please its customers, it’s amazing that it survives at all.
    The bosses at the big labels should give thanks every day to determined customers
    who figure out workarounds that let them enjoy commercially produced music, rather
    than giving up on it entirely.

    quality audio tape, and the very best became the digital tape for computing. Because
    of this you can use most computer tape for audio, which I do. The large quarter-inch
    cartridge (QIC) tapes that have gone bad are fantastic reel-to-reel tapes. I have
    an ancient solid-state Ampex home audio recorder, circa 1969 (transistors, point-to-point
    wired like the old vacuum tubes). With no noise reduction, 1 7/8-, 3 3/4-, and

    Vinyl LPs begin life as master tapes. These are copied to the master disk, which
    is made of metal or lacquer. Cutting a record is an exercise in compromise. Quiet
    passages can’t be too quiet or they will be lost in noise, but if they are too
    loud, the grooves will overlap and create skips. Louder volume also results in
    less playing time, so there is as much artistry in the engineering as there is
    the in music itself. Unfortunately, all LPs are not created equal. As the industry
    matured, a multitude of demands were placed on the master recording engineers,
    who were often told to make the master tapes also serve as masters for cassettes,
    and butchered for radio play. The vinyl itself became thinner. In other words,
    the lowest common denominator reared its mediocre head. Older LPs are beloved

    signal-to-noise ratio, plus something that even the best LP system is hard-pressed
    to deliver, and that is absolute silence in the silent passages. True, this absolute
    silence is largely theoretical because some sound will probably be created somewhere
    in your audio chain—a bit of hum, a touch of electrical interference—but the CD
    itself is dead silent. Vinyl wins on frequency range, sort of—if you have good
    enough equipment (which would make you a rare, wealthy, and elite audiophile indeed),
    it will capture frequencies as high as 70 to 75 kHz, up there where the bats fly.

    sound pressure level at a frequency of 45 kHz, you’ll feel the pain but not know
    why. Some folks believe that very high frequencies are still perceived in some
    manner and add to the listener’s enjoyment. What they might be talking about are
    the harmonics. If you have a sound at 100 Hz, there are harmonics of that sound
    at 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 200 Hz, and so on. If you clip the harmonics, the sound tends

    noise on LPs that sets them apart. I can really tell the difference in a symphony—the
    quiet passages on a CD are unmarred by scratches, hiss, or rumble, and the loud
    bits are loud and accurate, without distortion. If you want to make your own comparisons,
    make sure you have LPs and CDs that have been recorded with skill and care. An
    awful lot of them are junk, and the trend with modern popular music is simply
    to crank all levels on a CD to the maximum, with no regard for dynamic range,
    distortion, nuances, or balance. Pianos and organs are great for testing the quality
    of your audio system because their sounds are difficult to reproduce accurately,
    they have monster dynamic and frequency ranges, and you can tell pretty easily
    if they sound right. Try “Toccata and Fugue in D Minor” by Johann Sebastian Bach;
    this covers the full range of the pipe organ, the big kind you see in cathedrals.
    At one point, a bass pedal is held so long your speakers may visibly distort.
    Pink Floyd’s “Time” from the *Dark Side of the Moon* exercises the sound separation
    among left, right, and true center. Jimi Hendrix’s *Electric Ladyland*, if you
    can find the original double LP and not some bad CD remaster, is an amazing piece

    you’re going for a higher-end model. As with all digital audio, the quality of
    the digital-to-analog converter determines how good it sounds, so spending more
    can make a difference. If you are connecting your CD player to a receiver or amplifier
    that has its own DAC (you’ll see optical or coaxial digital inputs), that gives
    you two DACs to try. Using the digital connector means the CD player sends a digital
    signal to your receiver and does not use its own DAC. Instead, the receiver performs
    the conversion to analog. Using your CD player’s RCA connectors means your CD
    player will do the conversion and send an analog signal to your receiver. If you
    have a high-end CD player, you probably don’t want your receiver mucking with
    its output, so use the analog RCA connectors. Of course, it’s not always that
    simple, because in some modern A/V receivers, the integrated preamp converts all
    incoming signals with no regard for whether they are analog or digital, which
