<div class="calibre24" id="calibre_pb_0"/><h2 id="title-ID0ETAOM" class="docPrefaceTitle">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</h2>
<p class="docText1"><a name="The guides" class="calibre8" id="The guides"/>The guides in this book are constructed to provide information in a standard format. The book consists of two parts: <a class="calibre2" href="the_base_system_split_000.html#the_base_system">Part I</a>, "The Base System," and <a class="calibre2" href="third-party_applications_split_000.html#third-party_applications">Part II</a>, "Third-Party Applications."</p>
<p class="docText1"><a class="calibre2" href="the_base_system_split_000.html#the_base_system">Part I</a><a name="on installing" class="calibre8" id="on installing"/> provides information on installing the FreeBSD operating system. This section of the book also contains important information on setting up your base FreeBSD environment and updating the ports collection. If you need more information on the FreeBSD operating system, consult the <span class="docEmphasis1">FreeBSD Handbook</span><a name="resource and" class="calibre8" id="resource and"/>. It is an invaluable resource and can be found on the Web at <a class="calibre2" target="_blank" href="http://freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook">http://freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook</a>.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a class="calibre2" href="third-party_applications_split_000.html#third-party_applications">Part II</a><a name="of this" class="calibre8" id="of this"/> constitutes the bulk of this book. This section provides the information you'll need to install and configure software using the ports collection. Applications are divided into individual modules that are arranged alphabetically, minimizing the need to search indexes or tables of contents.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="between stability" class="calibre8" id="between stability"/>The applications covered in this book were carefully selected. A balance between stability and available support were determining factors in choosing which applications would be included. Stability is paramount in server environments. Community support is also very important for long-term viability of an application; a well-supported application means that resources will be available to you if you need help. Community support also encourages development efforts, which may lead to faster responses to bugs or security issues.</p>

<a name="becoming_the_superuser" class="calibre8" id="becoming_the_superuser"/>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="-100000">BECOMING THE SUPERUSER</h3>
<p class="docText1"><a name="and I" class="calibre8" id="and I"/>The direction "become the superuser" is used throughout the book, and I want to clarify its meaning early on. The term <span class="docEmphasis1">superuser</span><a name="account on" class="calibre8" id="account on"/> is synonymous with the root account on other UNIX-like systems. The <span class="docEmphasis1">root account</span><a name="administrative rights" class="calibre8" id="administrative rights"/> is a special user account that has full administrative rights to the system. Most of the modules in this book require you to execute commands as the superuser.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="at the" class="calibre8" id="at the"/>To become the superuser, you can log in at the console (using the <span class="docEmphasis1">console</span><a name="means you" class="calibre8" id="means you"/> means you are using the monitor and keyboard attached to the system) with the username root. There may be times when you need to log in remotely via SSH (Secure Shell). For security reasons, FreeBSD does not allow the root user to log in via SSH. You must first log in as a normal user, then switch to the superuser account with the <tt class="calibre20">su</tt><a name="accounts that" class="calibre8" id="accounts that"/> command. Only user accounts that belong to the wheel group may switch to the superuser account. The FreeBSD module in this book explains how to add your initial user to the wheel group during the installation process. If you don't follow that module or if you want to verify your group memberships, log in and then type:</p>
<pre class="calibre30"># <b class="calibre28">id</b>
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john), 0(wheel)</pre><br class="calibre1"/>
<p class="docText1"><a name="that the" class="calibre8" id="that the"/>You can see above that the user john is a member of the wheel group. To become the superuser, John would type:</p>
<pre class="calibre30"># <b class="calibre28">su</b></pre><br class="calibre1"/>
<p class="docText1"><a name="the superuser" class="calibre8" id="the superuser"/>After John enters the superuser (root) password, he will be switched to the superuser account. He could verify this by typing:</p>
<pre class="calibre30"># <b class="calibre28">whoami</b>
root</pre><br class="calibre1"/>
<p class="docText1"><a name="to the" class="calibre8" id="to the"/>Once logged in as the superuser, you may add other users to the wheel group with the following command:</p>
<pre class="calibre30"># <b class="calibre28">pw user mod</b> <b class="calibre28"><tt class="calibre20"><i class="docEmphasis1">uname</i></tt></b> <b class="calibre28">-G wheel</b></pre><br class="calibre1"/>
<p class="docText1">Replace <tt class="calibre20"><i class="docEmphasis1">uname</i></tt><a name="the user" class="calibre8" id="the user"/> with the username of the user you want to add.</p>
<a name="easy_editor" class="calibre8" id="easy_editor"/>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="-100000">EASY EDITOR</h3>
<p class="docText1"><a name="by the" class="calibre8" id="by the"/>Like on other UNIX-like platforms, FreeBSD configuration is controlled by the contents of various text configuration files. These configuration files dictate how the system behaves, so the ability to edit them is critical. FreeBSD includes ee (Easy Editor), which is easy to learn and has the basic functionality needed to perform administrative tasks. To start Easy Editor, simply type <tt class="calibre20"><b class="calibre28">ee</b></tt><a name="an example" class="calibre8" id="an example"/> at the command prompt. Here is an example of the interface:<a name="IDX-PREFACE-0001" class="calibre8" id="IDX-PREFACE-0001"/></p>
<div class="calibre1">
              Code View:</div><pre class="calibre30">^[ (escape) menu ^y search prompt ^k delete line   ^p prev li  ^g prev page
^o ascii code    ^x search        ^l undelete line ^n next li  ^v next page
^u end of file   ^a begin of line ^w delete word   ^b back 1 char
^t top of text   ^e end of line   ^r restore word  ^f forward 1 char
^c command       ^d delete char   ^j undelete char ^z next word

<p class="docText1"><a name="be pressed" class="calibre8" id="be pressed"/>The carat symbols indicate that the [ctrl] key should be pressed in combination with the adjacent letter. For example, to search the current text file for a certain word, press [ctrl-Y]. You will see the following search prompt:</p>
<pre class="calibre30">search for:</pre><br class="calibre1"/>
<p class="docText1"><a name="at the" class="calibre8" id="at the"/>Easy Editor shows prompts and status messages at the bottom of the screen. To access the menu system, press [esc]:</p>
<pre class="calibre30">+---------------------+

<p class="docText1"><a name="The interface" class="calibre8" id="The interface"/>The interface is intuitive and doesn't require much effort to learn. Take some time to familiarize yourself with Easy Editor once you complete the initial FreeBSD installation.</p>
