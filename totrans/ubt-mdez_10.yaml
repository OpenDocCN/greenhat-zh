    only makes sense, because it is those two tools that turn a web-surfing, game-playing,
    music-churning, number-crunching box of chips into a meaningful production tool—a
    virtual publishing house, if you will. These devices help your computer convert
    digital information into hard copy (in the case of printers) and convert hard
    copy into digital information (in the case of scanners). It is not surprising,
    therefore, that these tools often come together these days in the form of multifunction
    printers.

    and install new fonts so you can make your printed documents look their best.
    If you’re more into working with your digital camera than with a scanner, you
    might want to sneak a peek at [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Right-Brain
    Penguins"); otherwise, put on your printer’s smock and read on.

    supported and, if so, to what degree. Listings for supported printers also include
    information on which drivers are best for your purposes. If you’re thinking of
    buying a printer for use with your Linux system, those manufactured by HP and
    Epson tend to be a pretty safe bet. You may also want to consult Ubuntu’s list

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Printer handling in Ubuntu is pretty much a no-brainer, because Ubuntu automatically
    detects most printers. If you have a USB printer, connect it to your computer
    and then power up the printer (vice versa should work just fine, too). If Ubuntu
    recognizes your printer—and chances are it will—it will be set up automatically
    in the background, without you needing to click a single button. The process only
    takes a couple of seconds, so you should be ready to print straightaway. To check
    that everything is hunky-dory, click the power button on the far right of the
    top panel and select **Printers** from the menu that appears (alternatively, search
    for *Printers* in the Dash). If your printer has been set up correctly, the Printing
    window will contain an icon with the make and model of your printer listed beneath
    it. There is nothing more for you to do in this case—your printer is set up and
    ready to roll.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also possible, however, that Ubuntu will recognize your printer but not
    find a driver that is an exact match for it. In this case, a window should pop
    up after you connect the printer, offering a substitute driver. If you find yourself
    in this situation, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to print a test page to see whether
    the substituted driver works as it should. You can do this by selecting **Printers**
    from the top panel’s power button menu and then double-clicking your printer in
    the Printing window that appears. A Printer Properties window will open. Make
    sure that *Settings* is selected from the list to the left of the window and then
    click the **Print Test Page** button ([Figure 10-1](ch10.html#printing_a_test_page_with_your_new_print
    "Figure 10-1. Printing a test page with your new printer via the Printer Properties
    window")). If the test page looks normal (something like [Figure 10-2](ch10.html#an_ubuntu_printer_test_page
    "Figure 10-2. An Ubuntu printer test page")), everything should be fine, and you
    can close the Printer Properties and Printing windows.

    arises from the general blurring of how the terms *pixels per inch (ppi)* and

    yet they aren’t really the same thing. To make things simple, when you’re talking
    about images on your screen, you are talking about *pixels* (the little squares

    even more. This means that a photo scanned at 96ppi, which looks just fine on
    your screen, ends up looking pretty lame when you print it. On the other hand,
    when you scan a picture at 300ppi, the image will look much better in your printout
    but will be gigantic if you display it “full size” on your screen. This is because
    there will be three times as many pixels per inch, so it looks three times bigger

    printed output is not going to suffer if you scan your images at higher resolutions
    than those at which you plan to print them, but you will end up with a lot of
    files taking up too much disk space. Remember, *the higher the resolution of a
    scanned image, the greater the file size in terms of disk space*. If this is of
    concern to you, you can simply resize the images after you’re done printing using
