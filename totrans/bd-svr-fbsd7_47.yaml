- en: 'PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that
    can be embedded into HTML. It is commonly used to create dynamically generated
    websites and is the foundation of applications like WordPress (blogging software),
    MediaWiki (which underlies Wikipedia), and phpBB (a web-based bulletin board system).
    PHP is also known for its easy integration with relational database management
    systems. These applications all use a combination of PHP and a relational database
    system like MySQL.'

- en: Unlike JavaScript, which executes functions in a user's web browser, PHP handles
    functions on the web server. Websites that use JavaScript must send full blocks
    of code to clients' web browsers, which can eat up bandwidth, especially with
    large sites. PHP, on the other hand, executes code on the web server and then
    sends only the necessary HTML to the client to produce the completed page, thus
    eliminating the need to send lengthy code to web browsers.

- en: PHP began as a small set of Perl scripts written by Rasmus Lerdorf. He used
    them to monitor traffic to his online resume. In 1995, after adding features,
    Lerdorf publicly released a tool written in C called PHP/FI (Personal Home Page/Forms
    Interpreter). In 1997 two Israeli developers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote
    PHP/FI to accommodate their eCommerce project. This rewrite was released in mid-1998
    as PHP 3\. That winter, Suraski and Gutmans began another rewrite, this time of
    PHP's core. The product of this work became the Zend Engine, on which current
    versions of PHP are based.
