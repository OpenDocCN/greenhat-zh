This prevents unauthorized access to your computer, but it also blocks other computers on the LAN unless you specifically allow access from those computers (using their IP addresses). The firewall controls should include a function where you can identify trusted computers or allow local access (it's different for each firewall program); consult the firewall program's documentation for specific instructions.</p><p>If the firewall isn't blocking access, it's possible that the computer you're trying to reach is not configured properly, the access point doesn't recognize that computer's MAC address, or the other computer has filesharing turned off.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_signal_strength_is_weak_or_signal_qu"/>The signal strength is weak or signal quality is low.</h1></div></div></div><p>Assuming there's an access point close to your computer, a weak signal is probably caused by some kind of obstruction between your network adapter and the access point. To improve the signal quality and signal strength, try moving the adapter (and the computer if the adapter is on a PC Card) to a different location. The wavelength of radio signals at 2.4 GHz is extremely short (they're called <span class="emphasis"><em>microwaves</em></span> for a reason!), so moving the adapter even a short distance can be enough to make a noticeable difference.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1756"/></p><p>If you're using a USB adapter, you can be more flexible about its location. Try placing the adapter on top of a bookcase or in some other location with a clean shot to the access point. And try turning the adapter (or the external antenna) sideways so it's on its side rather than upright; this might bring the polarity of the adapter's antenna closer to the polarity of the antenna in the access point.</p></div>

<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="the_network_is_slow"/>The network is slow.</h1></div></div></div><p>Any time a single network segment slows down, the overall <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1759"/>performance of the network will suffer. A slow file transfer or download could be caused by an overloaded server or too many people trying to use the network at the same time. Within the wireless segment of the network, slow performance could be caused by high demand for access to the network or interference from other wireless networks and other radio services operating on the same frequency. Signal fading and multipath interference can also cause the wireless network data speed to drop.</p><p>To reduce interference, try to shift the access point to a different channel at least five steps away from the original channel. For example, if you're currently using channel 2, try shifting the access point to channel 7. This requires access to the access point's configuration software, so it's normally something that only a network administrator can do.</p><p>If you're the manager of a Wi-Fi network that's overloaded because too many users are online at the same time, add more access points that use different channels.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="my_computer_drops_its_connection"/>My computer drops its connection.</h1></div></div></div><p>It doesn't happen often, but a wireless network connection can occasionally disappear for no obvious reason. This disappearance could be caused <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1760"/>by a very brief burst of radio interference, an intermittent failure at the base station, or some other short-lived problem. There is always a reason, but it's often easier to simply restore the link than to spend hours searching for the cause.</p><p>Windows offers a quick fix for this kind of problem. To restore a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1761"/>dropped connection, try this method first:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>From the Control Panel, open <span class="strong"><strong>Network Connections</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Right-click the icon or listing for the connection profile that failed.

Windows will clear anything that remains from the failed connection, turn off the wireless adapter, and try to establish a new connection.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Try connecting to a website or some other Internet destination.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Repair command solves your problem, you can go back to what you were doing before you lost the connection. If you still can't connect to a nearby Wi-Fi hot spot or to your broadband data network, there might be some residual junk programs running on your computer that interfere with the wireless connection. To clean out the junk, try <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1762"/>rebooting the computer: Shut down Windows (or any other operating system), turn off the computer, wait 10 seconds, and then turn it back on again.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="if_all_else_fails_reboot"/><p class="title"><b>IF ALL ELSE FAILS, REBOOT</b></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1763"/>Restarting the computer is often the only thing necessary to clear a problem. When you turn the computer off and then back on again, you will get rid of the shards and fragments of old programs that are taking up space—but not doing anything useful—in your computer's memory. A <span class="emphasis"><em>cold reboot</em></span>, in which you turn the computer off (rather than a <span class="emphasis"><em>warm reboot</em></span>, in which you use the Restart command), can solve a multitude of apparent problems.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1764"/><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1765"/></p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="my_wi-fi_network_has_crashed"/>My Wi-Fi network has crashed.</h1></div></div></div><p>If you're a network manager and several of your users tell you that they can't connect to your Wi-Fi network, it's possible that the access point has temporarily flaked out (that's the technical term) or your wired connection to the Internet has dropped out. Take a look at the lights on the access point and the Internet gateway router to confirm that the Power and WAN indicators are on. If you can't find an obvious problem, try restarting the access point by unplugging and reconnecting the power plug.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1766"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="can_i_improve_performance_with_an_extern"/>Can I improve performance with an external antenna?</h1></div></div></div><p>As a rule of thumb, an external antenna will improve the signal strength of a wireless network signal by at least 15 percent because it can be placed in a position free of obstructions to the signal path. The external antenna can be attached to either the access point (in which case it will increase signal strength to every network client) or to a wireless network adapter. If you can place external <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1767"/>antennas on both ends of the link, the total improvement will be about 32.5 percent.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1768"/></p><p>This assumes that the captive antenna and the external antenna have exactly the same characteristics. If the external antenna is directional, or if it has more gain than the captive antenna, the performance improvement could be even greater. On the other hand, many network adapters and access points use two captive antennas in a <span class="emphasis"><em>diversity</em></span> system that constantly compares the signals from each antenna and selects the stronger one. In a noisy environment, a diversity antenna system might be more effective than a single antenna.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1769"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what_else_can_i_do_to_improve_performanc"/>What else can I do to improve performance?</h1></div></div></div><p>Energy radiated from a transmitting antenna is often polarized in either the horizontal or the vertical plane, so a receiving antenna will detect a stronger signal from an antenna with the same <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1770"/>polarity. In other words, if the transmitter uses a vertical antenna, the receiving antenna will detect a stronger signal if it is also vertical. If the transmitting antenna is horizontal, a horizontal receiving antenna will perform best.</p><p>At short range, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1771"/>polarity won't make a significant difference to the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1772"/>performance of a Wi-Fi link. Even if the two antennas have different polarity, they will still exchange signals that are strong enough to keep the data moving at full speed. But when you are trying to squeeze every possible data bit out of a weak or noisy signal, you might see some improvement when both antennas are polarized the same way.</p><p>The captive antennas built into most PC Card adapters are difficult or impossible to move without turning the whole computer on its side, but many access points have antennas mounted on swivels, so it's easy to move them from a vertical to a horizontal position.</p><p>If you are using a laptop computer with an internal network adapter, the antenna is probably built into the upper half of the "clamshell" alongside the screen. You can sometimes improve wireless performance by changing the angle of the screen or by rotating the entire computer on its base. You don't have to make a huge adjustment to the screen angle; a slight change can make the difference between a poor signal and one you can use.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="when_i_move_to_a_different_access_point_"/>When I move to a different access point, the adapter loses the connection.</h1></div></div></div><p>In a Wi-Fi network with more than one base station, wireless <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1773"/>adapters are supposed to detect all nearby access points and automatically shift their association to an access point with a clean, strong signal when you move from one place to another. However, the transfers don't always work properly. Sometimes an adapter will just drop the network connection when the signal from the nearest access point fades out. If that happens, try connecting again. If that doesn't work, try rebooting your computer.</p></div>

It's often much easier for a company to add wireless products to their catalogs by buying them from somebody else rather than creating and building their own designs.</p><p>Some companies that sell private label versions of adapters and access points might tell you who made them, but many salespeople will insist that they make everything themselves, and even if they don't, they stand by the warranty, so why should you care?</p><p>As a user or network manager, the name of the original equipment <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1777"/>manufacturer (OEM) should not make any difference to you, as long as the device carries Wi-Fi certification. If it has passed the Wi-Fi tests, you can assume that it will work reasonably well with the other equipment in your network, but sometimes it helps to know what's inside that sealed PC Card package. If you're using the adapter with a computer running Unix or Linux, the manufacturer's tech support people might not know where to find the right drivers and configuration tools for their devices, but when you know whose components are inside, you can find the drivers on your own. As a network manager, it can be useful to know which adapters are identical to the ones you're already using so you can keep a few spares on hand that will work with the existing drivers in your users' computers.</p><p>How do you find the name of the original <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1778"/>manufacturer? You'll have to do your own detective work. Every piece of electronic equipment sold in the United States that can emit radio energy must carry a <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1779"/>registration number issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This applies to radio transmitters such as wireless network devices, and also to most other computer components, because they emit radio energy as a side effect to whatever function they're supposed to <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1780"/>perform.</p><p>There's an FCC ID number on just about every wireless network device. For example, <a class="xref" href="ch17s17.html#every_wireless_adapter_has_a_unique_fcc_" title="Figure 17-3. Every wireless adapter has a unique FCC ID number.">Figure 17-3</a> shows the label on a Xircom PC Card adapter. The FCC ID number is LDK102038.</p><p>The FCC maintains a searchable database at <a class="ulink" href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm</a> that lists every ID number, <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1781"/>with links to copies of all the technical exhibits that the manufacturer supplied with their application for <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1782"/>registration.

Most of this information is boring technical stuff, but if you look around the exhibits, you can often find something that identifies the original manufacturer or the maker of an adapter's internal chip set.</p><div class="figure"><a id="every_wireless_adapter_has_a_unique_fcc_"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject17_d1e18539"/><img alt="Every wireless adapter has a unique FCC ID number." src="tagoreillycom20090210nostarchimages254136.png.jpg"/></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure 17-3. Every wireless adapter has a unique FCC ID number.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>The FCC database is also a great tool for people like me who have a junk box full of old computer circuit cards that seemed important enough to save but don't have labels that explain what they were good for. The database maps each card to a listing with a description of the card and maybe even a copy of the user's manual. With a make and model number, it's usually possible to find a manufacturer's website that provides even more details.</p><p>If you already have the device, often the easiest way to find out what it is, especially in an operating system like Linux or BSD, is to plug it in and see what happens. Typically, <code class="literal">dmesg, lspci</code>, or <code class="literal">lsusb</code> will give you enough information about the device specifics to plug into a search engine and find the original manufacturer and which drivers to use.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="is_the_software_that_came_with_my_networ"/>Is the software that came with my network adapter or access point up to date?</h1></div></div></div><p>The software supplied with wireless network adapters exists in two forms: programs that run on the computer connected to the adapter and internal firmware that controls the adapter itself. All the software that runs on an access point is internal firmware.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1783"/></p><p>The manufacturers of wireless networking hardware (and most other computer-related products) often issue new versions of the software that supports their products. Updated software might include fixes for bugs that were discovered after the product shipped, support for new operating systems, and additional features and functions such as improved encryption. Therefore, it's always useful to check the manufacturer's website to see what might be available. For updates to wireless broadband data adapters, look in the technical support section of your service provider's website.</p><p>Installing new configuration and status programs is easy; just load the new <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1784"/>software over the older version. In most cases, the manufacturer supplies the software in an executable file that automatically deletes earlier versions and runs a complete installation routine. It's always a good idea to read the README file or other instructions that were provided as part of the download package.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1785"/>Updating firmware is more complicated. The manufacturer or service provider always includes detailed instructions, which you should follow as closely as possible. Before you update the firmware in an access point, remember to warn all your users that the network will be offline for maintenance.</p></div>

If you're at the end of a free trial period, make sure the service provider hasn't cancelled your account.</p><p>Most broadband networks use DHCP to automatically assign an IP address and DNS address. Make sure the broadband network profile has DHCP enabled.</p><p>If your broadband connection still doesn't work, try removing and reinstalling the service provider's connection manager software from the original CD or from a copy on your hard drive. Most service providers have copies of the latest software available for download from their websites (you'll need either a Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1787"/>connection to reach the Internet when your broadband service isn't working).</p><p>If you are using a non-Windows operating system, such as OS X, Linux, or BSD, many broadband vendors require the first connection to be made using their Windows proprietary software. After the first connection is made, the device will usually work on other operating systems. Ask your vendor's support center for help with alternative operating systems.</p></div>

Fortunately, there are a few things you can do <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1788"/>to keep the power drain down to an absolute minimum.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1789"/></p><p>First, turn off or disconnect the adapter when you're not using it. If you're on an airplane or a train, or anywhere else where you're outside the range of a wireless signal, or if you're using the computer for some purpose that doesn't require network access, remove the PC Card adapter from its socket or unplug the USB cable. If your computer has an internal wireless adapter, turn it off.</p><p>This is good advice for any plug-in device on a PC Card. If you're not using it, remove it. Modems, Ethernet adapters, and storage cards all consume power any time they're plugged into the computer, so your battery will keep going longer if the socket is empty.</p><p>When you use your wireless network adapter, you can reduce power consumption by using the <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1790"/>Power Saving Protocol that's part of the 802.11 specification. Someplace in the adapter's configuration utility, there's a set of power management options that can instruct the adapter to enter a power saving mode:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1791"/>Constantly Awake Mode (<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1792"/>CAM) consumes the most power and provides the fastest response. In CAM mode, the adapter is on all the time. It receives all incoming messages as soon as the access point gets them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1793"/>Power Saving Protocol (PSP) mode consumes less power, but it also provides slower response. In <a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1794"/>PSP mode, the adapter instructs the access point to hold messages for this network node in a buffer, and it enters a low-power sleep mode. At regular time intervals (several times each minute), the adapter wakes up and polls the access point for messages. Because there's a delay between the time the access point receives each message and the time it sends the message on to the sleeping adapter, data and messages will take longer to move through the network.</p></li></ul></div></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="can_i_use_my_access_point_as_a_network_b"/>Can I use my access point as a network bridge?</h1></div></div></div><p>An access point is a bridge between a wireless network and a wired LAN. If a single access point is not adequate to reach the entire area to be served by the wireless network, connecting additional access points to the wired LAN can extend the coverage area. But a <span class="emphasis"><em>wireless bridge</em></span>, in which the wireless link connects two LANs together, is a more specialized device. Many access points offer wireless bridging as an option, but not as part of the basic feature set. If you plan to use an access point as a bridge between networks, check the specifications before you buy it. Your best bet is to buy a separate wireless bridge rather than trying to jury-rig a generic wireless adapter.<a class="indexterm" id="idx-CHP-17-1795"/></p></div>
<div class="sect1" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ive_heard_that_radio_signals_from_cellul"/>I've heard that radio signals from cellular phones might be dangerous. What about Wi-Fi?</h1></div></div></div><p>Some people believe the jury is still out on the safety of cellular telephones. Others are convinced that they're a serious health threat. Scientists and engineers have performed studies and published papers that claim to prove that extended use of a cell phone can—or can't possibly—cause cancer, make milk go sour, or have some other terrible effect. Human exposure to electromagnetic fields at the frequencies used by cell phones and wireless network adapters is within the levels that most organizations and regulatory agencies that have studied the matter consider safe. The dissenters believe that those levels are too high.</p><p>Even if you think cell phones are potentially dangerous, it's likely that the radios in wireless adapters are safer, for several reasons. First, when a cellular telephone is transmitting, it's usually just an inch or two from the user's brain, but a wireless adapter is probably a foot or more away (even though they're called <span class="emphasis"><em>laptops</em></span>, most people use them on a table rather than on their laps). The effect of nonionizing radiation (a fancy name for radio waves) decreases at a rate equal to the square of the distance, so a transmitter located two inches from your head will have about 36 times more effect on your body than a radio located a foot away, assuming that both radio signals are equally strong at the antenna.</p><p>Second, the radio in a cell phone is 20 times more powerful than a radio in a wireless adapter (0.60 watts versus 0.03 watts), so the intensity of the signal is more than 700 times stronger.</p><p>Finally, the effect of radio frequency radiation on organic matter is cumulative—the longer the body is exposed to radiation, the greater the effect. Most cell phones transmit a continuous stream of packets as long as the phone conversation is going on, but wireless LANs are bursty services that are only active when they are actually transmitting data. The total amount of transmission time for a wireless adapter is just a fraction of the time that a cell phone is active.</p><p>Therefore, the total amount of radiation your body receives from a wireless network adapter is just a tiny fraction of the amount you receive from a cell phone. There are plenty of other, more serious, threats to your health and safety.</p></div></body></html>
