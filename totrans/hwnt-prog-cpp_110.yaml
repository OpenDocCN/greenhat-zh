- en: 'A user called up technical support with a big problem. The technician tried
    for several hours to fix the problem over the phone but failed, so he asked the
    user to send him a copy of his disk. The next day, by Federal Express a letter
    arrived for the technician containing a photocopy of the disk. The user wasn''t
    completely dumb: He knew that he had a two-sided disk, so he copied both sides.'

    the photocopy. Turns out the user had the wrong version of the software.
