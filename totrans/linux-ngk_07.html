</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you no doubt know from experience,  the longer you work on your computer, the  more and more files you will have on your  hard disk. Many of these you will have created  yourself, others you will have downloaded off the  Net, and others you will have gotten from other people  on CD or floppy. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Being able to use floppies and CDs is essential when using your computer.  Whether it be for sending photos to your relatives, listening to music on your  computer, or just backing up all the valuable items you have stored on your hard  disk, you will eventually want or have to turn to disk.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When the original Macintosh first came out, one of the coolest things about it  was that it used 3.5-inch floppy disks (aka floppies). At the time, I thought that  those disks, with their hard casing and sliding metal doors protecting the media  itself, were the incarnation of high-tech cool. Times change, of course, and there  are fewer and fewer people using floppies these days. The reason for this change  is simple: Files have just gotten too big for floppies and their very limited 1.4MB capacity. The audio, video, and image files most people deal with these days are  gigantic. You’d be lucky, for example, to fit more than three digital photos on  one floppy disk. Compared to the other removable storage media popular today,  such as CDs, Zip disks, memory cards, and the like, floppies are also too slow. You  could practically feed the cat, make a cup of coffee, and read the first three pages  of the newspaper in the time it takes to write a good number of files to a floppy.  (Well, okay, that’s an exaggeration, but floppies are slow compared to the  alternatives.)</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Despite being small and slow, floppies are still used by a dwindling number  of people who have no other way of transferring files to removable media, or who  just want to hand over one or two small word-processing documents to another  person who can read no other type of media. You may be one of these people, or  you may have to send files to or receive them from someone in this situation.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Using floppies on your system is easy enough, though it is probably not as  straightforward a task as you are familiar with, especially if you are a Mac  emigrant. Let’s say you have a floppy that you made with your old system, and  you want to copy the files on it to your new system. As you might imagine, you  first need to put the floppy into the disk drive. So far, so good. In order to see  what’s on the floppy, though, you have to <i class="calibre11">mount</i> the disk. To put it simply,  mounting a disk is sort of like telling your system, “Hey, I’ve just stuck a disk in the drive, so wake up and deal with it.” If your system isn’t aware that your floppy  is in there, it can’t very well show you what’s on it, right? While Fedora, like most  operating systems these days, automatically mounts CDs, it does not extend the  courtesy to floppies. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The easiest way to mount the floppy is to right-click anywhere on your  desktop, and then in the pop-up menu select <b class="calibre13">Disks </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Floppy</b>. Fedora will then  mount your floppy and place a small floppy disk icon on your desktop to let you  know it’s done the job. Now double-click that icon, and a new Nautilus window  will appear, displaying the contents of that disk. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Copying files from your floppy to your hard disk involves the same drag-and-drop  procedure that you used in your previous operating system, and as such, it  requires no special explanation. However, things are a little different when it  comes to writing to the floppy — when you drag a file to the Nautilus window  with the list of your floppy disk’s contents, your system doesn’t actually write  anything to the disk at that time. You can confirm this by looking at the activity  light on your floppy disk drive. <a name="315" id="315"/><a name="IDX-100" id="IDX-100"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you first put your disk in the drive, you will see that the light stays off. Mount the drive by right-clicking the desktop and selecting<b class="calibre13"> Disks </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Floppy</b>, and  the drive light comes on. Drag a file from the floppy to the trash, and the drive  light will come on. Drag a file from the floppy to the desktop or your Home  folder, and the light will come on. However, drag a file from your Home folder, or anywhere else on your hard disk, to the floppy, and the light will stay off. The  file will appear in the floppy’s Nautilus window, but the drive light will not come  on because the files have not yet been written to disk.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The actual writing takes place when you are all done. Once you have  dragged whatever it is that you want to copy to the floppy and are ready to eject  it, you have to <i class="calibre11">unmount</i> the floppy first. To do this, close the floppy’s Nautilus  window, right-click the desktop floppy disk’s icon, and in the pop-up menu,  select <b class="calibre13">Eject</b>. At that time, the light on your floppy drive will come on as your  system writes the files to disk. Once it is done, the floppy disk icon will disappear  from your desktop and you can remove the disk from the drive. As you can see,  this is a bit different, but not at all difficult. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After you have gone through the unmounting process I have just mentioned,  you may sometimes still get a window telling you that the system cannot unmount  your floppy disk, when in fact it has just done so or is in the process of doing so.  You will know that this is the case if the floppy’s icon on the desktop disappears  while you are in the midst of reading the no-can-do message. If you come across  this scenario, it is all because your floppy is just too slow to keep up with the  system. You can safely ignore the warning by clicking<b class="calibre13"> OK</b>. If the floppy disk icon  disappears, you know that it has been unmounted. </p>

<i class="calibre11"> As data is written to a floppy disk when the disk is ejected, things can get confusing if you want to directly transfer data from another form of removable data to floppy. I would  strongly recommend creating a folder on your hard disk called </i><b class="calibre13"><i class="calibre11">data_transfer</i></b><i class="calibre11"> (or something to that effect), which you can use as a staging area of sorts. Just copy the data from one removable source (such as a CD), and then copy the data from there to your floppy.

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before you can actually write anything to a disk, that disk has to have been  formatted. This is true of any kind of storage media, whether it be your hard disk,  CDs, storage cards in your digital camera, or floppy disks, though it is sometimes done before you buy the media. By formatting a disk, your system (at your  request) lays down a sort of map on the disk to specify where data can be stored.  Because there are, and have been, many operating systems, there are many such  formats. Linux can read both Linux-native <i class="calibre11">ext2</i>-formatted disks and Windows/ DOS <i class="calibre11">FAT</i>-formatted disks. It can also create either format. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To format an unformatted floppy disk, place the disk in the drive, and then,  in the Main menu, select <b class="calibre13">System Tools </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Floppy Formatter</b>. This will bring up the  Floppy Formatter window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU77">Figure 7-1</a> on the next page).<a name="318" id="318"/><a name="IDX-101" id="IDX-101"/>

<span><span>Figure 7-1: </span> Formatting a floppy disk</span>

Once  you have done that, you can begin formatting the floppy by clicking <b class="calibre13">Format</b>.  Very simple.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you want to reformat an already formatted floppy in order to erase it or  change the format (from ext2 to FAT, for example), you can get to the Floppy  Formatter in the way just mentioned, or you can first mount the floppy and then right-click the floppy disk icon that appears on the desktop, and select <b class="calibre13">Format </b>from the pop-up window. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Dealing with CDs is much easier than dealing with floppies, as everything is quite  automatic. To read a CD with data on it, rather than music, place the CD in your  CD drive, and a CD icon will automatically appear on the desktop. Double- clicking that icon will bring up a Nautilus window displaying the CD’s contents,  and copying files from that window to your Home folder is a standard drag-and- drop procedure. Remember, as I mentioned in <a href="DDU0024_split_000.html#81" target="_parent">Chapter 3</a>, any file that you copy  from CD to your hard disk will be write protected, as indicated by a red <i class="calibre11">verboten </i>symbol with a pencil through it. In order to be able to write to that file, you will  have to change its permissions. These are accessible by right-clicking the file,  selecting <b class="calibre13">Properties</b> in the pop-up window, and then clicking the <b class="calibre13">Permissions</b> tab  in the Properites window. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you want to remove the CD, just close its Nautilus window, right-click the desktop CD icon, and in the pop-up menu select <b class="calibre13">Eject</b>. The CD will be  ejected automatically. Now that really is easy, even for Mac emigrants. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Playing music CDs is equally automatic.

This is useful if the online  database information is wrong or if you don’t have an Internet connection. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To open the CDDB Track Editor, click the Track Editor button in the CD  Player window (near the bottom-left corner, showing the hand on the list). When  the Track Editor window opens, you can input or modify the title of the CD, the  name of the artist, and all the song titles (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU79">Figure 7-3</a>).</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">These days it seems that almost all computers have built-in CD-RW (CDRewritable) drives, so much so that I would call them a near necessity. CD-RW drives, in case you’re wondering, work just like CD-ROM drives in that they allow  you to read data or play music from CDs. They also, however, allow you to burn  data to blank CDs. If you don’t have a CD-RW drive in your machine, I would  strongly recommend your getting one. Drives for desktop machines are relatively  cheap (around $40 or less from Amazon.com), and are easily installed. If you  would like a little help with doing it, check out my Web page for this book (<a target="_top" href="http://www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks">www.edgy-penguins.org/non-geeks</a>). You’ll even find a set of instructions I  created in PDF format that you can download.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Burning data CDs in GNOME has become extremely easy since the appearance  of the Nautilus CD Creator in Red Hat Linux It is one of the many reasons I prefer GNOME to KDE. To burn a data CD, just place a blank CD-R (CD-Recordable) disk in your drive, and an empty Nautilus CD Creator window will open (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU80">Figure 7-4</a>). </p>
<div class="calibre10">
<a name="328" id="328"/><a name="figure.DDU80" id="figure.DDU80"/><span><a href="0704_0.jpg" name="IMG_82" target="_parent" id="IMG_82"><img src="0704.jpg" alt="Click To expand" border="0" class="calibre84"/></a></span>

<span><span>Figure 7-4: </span> An empty Nautilus CD Creator window</span>
</div>
<a name="329" id="329"/><a name="IDX-104" id="IDX-104"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">After that, things are just as simple. Drag all of the files you want to burn to CD to the CD Creator window. Remember that once you’ve written those files to a CD-R  disk, the files are there to stay; you cannot add or remove files from that disk later, so make sure you’ve got everything you want to burn ready to go before  you commit. Once your list of files is complete, click the <b class="calibre13">Write to CD</b> button.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The window shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU81">Figure 7-5</a> will then appear, telling you how many  megabytes of files you have selected to write to CD. In this window, you can adjust  the write speed and give your CD a title; you can also just accept the defaults that  CD Creator automatically selected. You should uncheck the <b class="calibre13">Reuse these files for  another CD</b> checkbox unless you are planning to burn more than one CD of the  same data. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">CD-RW disks are pretty much like CD-R disks except that they can be erased and  then written to again. They are also quite a bit more expensive than CD-R disks. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Using CD-RW disks is much like working with CD-R disks. If the disk is blank, there is no difference in the process at all, which makes things quite simple. If,  however, the CD-RW disk already has data on it that you wish to replace with something else, the process is only slightly different. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">One of these differences is that Nautilus will treat your CD-RW disk as a  regular data disk rather than a blank one. This means that when you pop your  disk into the drive, a regular Nautilus window will automatically open, rather  than a CD Creator window. <a name="332" id="332"/><a name="IDX-105" id="IDX-105"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To write to the disk, you will need to switch from the Nautilus window to a  CD Creator window manually, which is easily done by selecting <b class="calibre13">CD Creator</b> in the  <b class="calibre13">Go</b> menu of the Nautilus window (or by replacing the <b class="calibre13"><span>/mnt/cdrom</span></b> text in the  <b class="calibre13">Location</b> box of that Nautilus window with <span>burn:///</span> and pressing ENTER). Once you’ve done this, the window will become a CD Creator window. Now drag the  files you want to burn to CD to that window, and, once you are ready to burn,  click the <b class="calibre13">Write to CD</b> button.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now comes the only other difference: In the Nautilus CD Creator dialog  window (shown in <a href="DDU0060.html#330" target="_parent">Figure 7-5</a> on the previous page), click the<b class="calibre13"> Erase CD </b>checkbox. Once you have done that, just click the <b class="calibre13">Write files to CD</b> button, and  CD Creator will erase the files already on the CD-RW and replace them with the  new ones that you dragged to the CD Creator window. Not bad at all, eh?</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The first time you use X-CD-Roast, you will most likely be told that you need to  set things up before you go on, so click the <b class="calibre13">Setup</b> button, and in the Setup  window, click the <b class="calibre13">CD Settings</b> tab. Your CD drive should be listed as the <b class="calibre13">CD  Writer Device</b> and <b class="calibre13">Primary Read Device</b>. If not, make it so in both cases. Then  click the <b class="calibre13">HD Settings</b> tab.

</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you are going to be doing a lot of CD copying, it would probably behoove  you to create a new folder within your Home folder for this purpose to keep  things tidy. You could name the folder something like “CD_stuff.” If you aren’t  going to be doing a lot of CD copying, you can probably get away without  creating any new folders.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">At the bottom of the Setup window, where it says <b class="calibre13">Path</b>, type <span>/home/username/CD_stuff</span> if you created a CD_stuff subfolder (of course, you should replace  <i class="calibre11">username</i> with your actual username), or you can just type in<span> /home/username</span> if you  did not create a CD_stuff subfolder.

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get started with the duplication process, click the <b class="calibre13">Duplicate CD</b> button on the  left side of the main X-CD-Roast window (shown earlier in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU82">Figure 7-6</a>). In order  for X-CD-Roast to duplicate a CD, it must first read that CD and temporarily store  its data in the folder you specified during setup, so put the CD that you want to  duplicate in your CD drive. Of course, GNOME CD Player will automatically start  up if you put in an audio CD, so you will have to quit the player before going on.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you have done that, click the <b class="calibre13">Read CD</b> button in the Duplicate CD  window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU83">Figure 7-7</a> on the next page). The type of CD you have in your drive,  as well as the number of tracks on it, should then be listed in the CD-Information  frame in the window. If everything looks right, adjust the read/write speed in the  <b class="calibre13">Speed</b> box to the highest speed your drive allows, or maybe a little slower for  safety; the default speed setting is 1, which will cause the process to take forever  and a day if you don’t change it. Next, click the <b class="calibre13">Read all tracks</b> button, and the  read process will begin. The progress of the read process will be shown in a read- progress window, and when the process is complete, that window will tell you so.  Click <b class="calibre13">OK</b> when it says it’s done.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the CD has been read, you will want to write a new CD. Remove the source  CD from your drive, and then click the <b class="calibre13">Write CD</b> button on the left side of the  Duplicate CD window. If all the data looks correct, adjust the drive speed so that  it is somewhat lower than the highest write speed of your drive, and then click  the <b class="calibre13">Write CD</b> button at the bottom of the window (not the big one on the left). A  small window will then pop up telling you to insert a blank CD in your drive. Do  what it says, and then click<b class="calibre13"> OK</b>. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">X-CD-Roast will then begin burning your duplicate CD, and it will show its  progress in a progress window. When the writing is all done, X-CD-Roast will  automatically eject your CD and tell you it is done. At that point, you can close  the progress window by clicking <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.<a name="340" id="340"/><a name="IDX-107" id="IDX-107"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The steps in the preceding sections will cause X-CD-Roast to write all the files from your source CD to your Home folder (or to your CD_stuff folder if you  created one) during the read process, and then to transfer all those files to the  new CD. However, you probably do not want the copied versions of these files  taking up space on your computer long after the new CD is burned, so you  should delete them. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To do this, click the<b class="calibre13"> Delete Tracks</b> button on the left side of the Duplicate  CD window (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU83">Figure 7-7</a>). You should now see a list of all the tracks it  created. Click <b class="calibre13">Select All</b>, and then click <b class="calibre13">Delete Selected Tracks</b>. A small window  will then pop up asking you if you want to delete the number of tracks you have  selected; click <b class="calibre13">Yes</b>, and the files will be deleted. When the process is finished, the  progress window will say so, and you can click <b class="calibre13">OK</b>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">When you download Fedora Core or other Linux distributions from the Internet,  you usually download them in the form of one or more disk images, which are  commonly referred to as ISOs because such files end in the .iso extension. An  <i class="calibre11">ISO</i> is an image of a CD’s file contents, which means that it is the CD minus the  media itself. To put it another way, if CDs had souls, the ISO would be the soul of a CD; take away the CD’s metal and plastic, and the remaining data would be  an ISO. <a name="343" id="343"/><a name="IDX-108" id="IDX-108"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As it is impossible to physically download a CD over the Net, the bodyless  ISOs are the next best thing. For example, to get a working copy of Fedora Core  from the Net, you need to download three ISOs, each which you can then burn onto a blank CD in order to give the images their bodies back, so to speak. In the  process you thus create the three working installation disks that you need to install  Fedora. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">X-CD-Roast is the program of choice, my choice anyway, for burning (or  duplicating) ISOs. The process is similar to that for duplicating CDs, albeit a  bit simpler, as you already have a virtual CD, the ISO you downloaded, on your hard  disk.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To start off, run X-CD-Roast as in the <a href="DDU0062.html#333" target="_parent">previous section</a> and, assuming you have  already gone through the setup process, click the <b class="calibre13">Create CD</b> button in the main  window (shown in <a href="DDU0062.html#334" target="_parent">Figure 7-6</a> on <a href="DDU0062.html#336" target="_parent">page 106</a>). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once in the Create CD window, click the <b class="calibre13">Write Tracks</b> button, and you will be in  the Write Tracks page of the Create CD window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU84">Figure 7-8</a>). Click the <b class="calibre13">Layout  tracks</b> tab, and in the Image Information pane you will see a list of all of the ISOs that  are present in your CD_stuff folder (or whatever other folder you specified during  setup). Click the ISO that you want to copy to disk, and then click <b class="calibre13">Add</b>. The ISO you  selected will then appear in the Tracks to Write pane, and you can click the <b class="calibre13">Accept  Track Layout</b> button at the bottom of the page. Then click the <b class="calibre13">Write Tracks</b> tab.</p>

<span><span>Figure 7-8: </span> Selecting an ISO to burn to CD in X-CD-Roast </span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In the Write Tracks tab, the ISO that you selected should appear in the white pane. If  so, adjust the write speed in the <b class="calibre13">Speed</b> box so that it is less than the maximum write  speed for your drive; I personally find it better to limit the speed to about 8 when  creating Linux installation CDs, as CDs written at faster speeds sometimes create  installation headaches. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once you’ve done that, click the <b class="calibre13">Write Tracks</b> button at the bottom of the page,  and you will be prompted to put a blank CD in your drive. Do that, and then click  <b class="calibre13">OK</b>. The write process will then begin. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As ISOs are usually quite large, the process will take a bit of time, so you will have  to be a little patient. When it is all finished, X-CD-Roast will automatically eject your  CD, and you can then close the remaining windows.</p>
