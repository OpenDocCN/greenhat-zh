<p class="docText1"><a name="Samba is" class="calibre8" id="Samba is"/>Samba is an open source implementation of the <span class="docEmphasis1">SMB (Server Message Block)</span> and <span class="docEmphasis1"><a name="File System" class="calibre8" id="File System"/>CIFS (Common Internet File System)</span><a name="files and" class="calibre8" id="files and"/> protocols, which are used for sharing files and printers over a Microsoft network. Samba was created to provide Windows-compatible file and printer sharing services with UNIX-like systems.<a name="IDX-CHP-27-0401" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0401"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0402" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0402"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0403" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0403"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0404" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0404"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0405" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0405"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0406" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0406"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0407" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0407"/><a name="IDX-CHP-27-0408" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0408"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="originally developed" class="calibre8" id="originally developed"/>SMB was originally developed to run atop the NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) protocol. However, because NetBIOS was conceived for small networks, it lacked routing capabilities, which limited SMB to local area networks. In 1996, Microsoft modified SMB so that it would not rely on NetBIOS, and renamed it Common Internet File System (CIFS). With the release of Windows 2000, SMB/CIFS was able to run atop TCP/IP.<a name="IDX-CHP-27-0409" class="calibre8" id="IDX-CHP-27-0409"/></p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="just like" class="calibre8" id="just like"/>Samba shares appear just like other shared folders in a Windows network. Access privileges can be cascaded over the normal Unix file permissions, and configurable restrictions based on login may be implemented as well. Unix users may also mount and access shares with the Samba client, which is similar to an FTP client. Samba consists of two daemons, namely smbd and nmbd. The SMB daemon handles file and print services as well as authentication. The NMB daemon handles name resolution and file browsing capability.</p>
<p class="docText1"><a name="early " class="calibre8" id="early "/>Dr. Barry Feigenbaum of IBM developed the SMB protocol in the early '80s as a solution for building small local area networks. Microsoft later built on the original SMB foundation and became the dominant user of the technology. Andrew Tridgell developed Samba in 1992 by reverse-engineering the SMB protocol to fit his needs. The Samba project is now a multi-national team and continues to develop new features.</p>
