</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">There are basically two kinds of fonts:  bitmap and outline. The difference between  these two is essentially the same as that  between bitmap and vector graphics, which I  discussed in <a href="DDU0102_split_000.html#622" target="_parent">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Bitmap characters are stored as a map of dots — the bitmap. The main limitation  of bitmaps is that they only look good at the size and resolution they were designed  for. Just like bitmap images, the more you enlarge a bitmap character, the worse it  looks. This is particulary noticeable in rounded characters, such as O and P, where “the jaggies” becomes an issue. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Outline fonts, on the other hand, are similar in concept and design to vector  graphics. Each character is stored as a mathematical formula, and just like vector  graphics, outline characters keep their clean shape no matter how much you enlarge  them. The main outline font formats are Type 1, or PostScript, which was developed  by Adobe, and TrueType, which was developed by Apple. As free TrueType fonts are  so easy to deal with, so readily available on the Net, and so easily handled in Fedora  Core, I will focus on TrueType fonts in this chapter. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Your Fedora system comes with a wide variety of very usable and, at least  to my eyes, rather handsome TrueType fonts. However, these tend to be a bit  on the conservative side of the aesthetic spectrum, and many users tend to want  to add a few somewhat more distinctive, usually wilder, fonts to the system  repertoire. In my own case, I had this really cool idea of writing messages to my  friend in old Scandinavian runes. Of course, my friend wet-blanketed the whole  idea, so it all came to naught.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You probably won’t be interested in sending cryptic runic messages to your  friends, but you may want to print out an award for some event using some sort of  Gothic font, or you might be preparing a newsletter for your local chapter of the  snail breeders’ society and want to use a font that is round, bubbly, and slimy.  Whatever your penchant, purpose, or desire, you will probably come to the point  when you want to install some other TrueType fonts on your system. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before you install anything, of course, you have to find some fonts. The  Internet is a good source, of course, and there are many sites that have a variety  of freeware, shareware, and for-sale TrueType fonts available for download.  When choosing and downloading fonts, it is best to select those designed for  Windows rather than those for Mac. Fonts designed for the Windows world will  most likely be in the form of ZIP files, and this will pose no problem for you,  because once they are on your machine you can extract them with File Roller.  Simply double-click them, just as you have with the other tarballs you have used  thus far, and go through the File Roller steps you learned in <a href="DDU0068_split_000.html#372" target="_parent">Chapter 9</a>. Once  you’ve done this, the font file will appear as an icon showing an upper- and  lowercase sample of the first letter in that font (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU167">Figure 16-1</a>). </p>

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 16-1: </span> Font icons display the first letter in the font</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In addition to getting a glimpse of what the fonts look like through these icons,  you can also see all, or at least almost all, of the characters in a given font by  double-clicking the font icon. A window, as shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU168">Figure 16-2</a>, will open, showing you most of the characters in A-to-Z format and then in the traditional  “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog” format that you may well  remember from your junior or senior high school typing classes.<a name="715" id="715"/><a name="IDX-224" id="IDX-224"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">At the present time, there are two ways in which Fedora deals with fonts, which  means there are two ways to install fonts, depending on what applications you  want to make the fonts available to. Rather than twist your mind by explaining  the technical aspects of these differences, I will instead just tell you how to install  fonts by each method and which applications each installation method will make  the fonts available to. Fortunately, the easier of these two installation methods  will probably be the only one in the future, but for now you’ll need to know  about both.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">This first font installation method is the easier, and newer, of the two, and it  requires almost no effort on your part. For the sake of convenience, I will refer  to the installation process for such fonts as “the easy method.” <a name="719" id="719"/><a name="IDX-225" id="IDX-225"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Fonts installed using the easy method can be used by the <i class="calibre11">fontconfig</i> font subsystem, which handles the fonts for the vast majority of applications installed  on your system. Such fonts will be available to GNOME and KDE applications, to Mozilla, and, with a tad more tinkering, to OpenOffice.org. These fonts are also  available to your system for customizing GNOME and KDE. Basically, if you’re  not trying to install fonts for use with the GIMP, this easy method is the method  to use.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Slightly different installation steps are required depending on whether you  install the fonts locally (for use only by the user who installs them) or globally (for use by all users on the computer). To keep things easy, I will begin with the  local installation process, as that is by far the easiest of all.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Internet is awash in free fonts. For this project, I will point you to the www. fontfreak.com site, which has a very nice collection of fonts. Once you get to the  FontFreak splash page, click<b class="calibre13"> ENTER</b>, which will lead you to the main page. Once  there, click the button on the left that says <b class="calibre13">PC Fonts</b>, which will bring you to the  first page of PC fonts. You can browse through the various pages until you find  some fonts to your liking. Which fonts you download is completely up to you.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you will also need fonts for <a href="DDU0121.html#734" target="_parent">Project 16B</a>, you might as well download them  now too. All in all, for the two projects, you will need eight fonts, which you  should download to your Home folder (not to one of the subfolders). Be sure to unzip your font files before going on to the installation steps.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you prefer truly immediate feedback on your installation progress, you can try  the following variation of the installation process, which yields the same results as  in 16A-1.

Let’s use two more of the  fonts you downloaded. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The font folder for globally installed fonts is in root territory, so you will  need to become root to install fonts in this way. Follow these steps:</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">So what happens if you have a Linux-only setup, and consequently no Windows  fonts, but you still have to deal with documents you receive that are written with  Windows fonts? Well, fortunately you are in luck, because you can download and  install the group of fonts known as Microsoft TrueType Core Fonts, which  includes Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Comic Sans, and a few others.  These fonts are actually packaged as Windows executable files (.exe), so you will  also need to install a utility called <b class="calibre13">cabextract</b> in order to extract the fonts (the .ttf  files) from the .exe files.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The cabextract utility can be downloaded and installed with Synaptic. Just  type <span>cabextract</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> search box, and then follow the usual procedures that  you learned in <a href="DDU0076_split_000.html#452" target="_parent">Chapter 10</a>. To get the fonts, go to <a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a> projects/corefonts. On that page, scroll down until you get to the <b class="calibre13">Latest File  Releases</b> section. There you should find three items: <b class="calibre13">cabextract</b>, <b class="calibre13">corefonts</b>, and  <b class="calibre13">the fonts</b>. To proceed, click the <b class="calibre13">Download </b>link next to <b class="calibre13">the fonts</b>, which will take  you to the download page, from which you can select the fonts you want. I would  recommend installing at least Arial, Courier, and Times, because they are not  only pretty standard fare out there in the computing world, but they also provide  you with significant foreign language support, which could come in handy even  if you don’t consciously care about such things.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Once the files are downloaded, use the newly installed cabextract to get to  the fonts in those .exe files. To make it easy, it is probably best to first create a  new folder inside your Home folder, call the new folder <span>mscorefonts</span>, and then  drag all the .exe files you downloaded into that folder. Once you’ve done that,  open a new Command Terminal window and do the following (you don’t have to  be root to do any of this):</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>cd mscorefonts</span> and press ENTER. This will take you into the mscorefonts  folder.</p>
</li>
<li class="first-listitem">
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Type <span>cabextract *.exe</span> and press ENTER. This will tell the newly installed  cabextract program to extract the contents of all files ending in .exe within  the mscorefonts folder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you look inside the mscorefonts folder, you should see the original .exe files,  your new fonts (the .ttf files), and maybe even a file called <b class="calibre13">fontinst.inf</b>, which you  can ignore. To install the fonts, just install the .ttf files by following the  instructions earlier in this chapter for installing fonts using the easy method.</p>

Sure, it is easy and  fun to live with the gaudiest desktop imaginable, the wildest and most  mismatched color scheme on the planet, and the goofiest icon scheme ever to be  seen by post-Neanderthal man, but if your font selections get too out of hand,  watch out!
