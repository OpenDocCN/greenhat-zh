    copyediting, research and writing, fact-checking, or fixing vandalism, you shouldn't
    have any trouble finding articles to improve and expand. This chapter describes
    the basic mechanics of editing existing pages—opening and understanding the edit
    window and using wikisyntax to format text. We'll also discuss how to perform
    both major and minor edits, how to revert edits to fix mistakes, and how pages
    are protected. The information in this chapter forms the basis for understanding
    the more advanced editing techniques described in the next five chapters.

    and then saving a page. Edits range from fixing a typo to rewriting an entire
    article from scratch; you can change any amount of text with a single edit to
    a page. In other words, you have permission to modify any article as you see fit.
    What you do with this editing permission naturally reflects on you.'

    on the site, from those just trying out the system to those who are effectively
    on Wikipedia full-time. This free-form editorial process contrasts with the editorial
    layers found in other forms of publishing. You should be aware, though, that there
    are some expectations of any editor: Obviously, Wikipedia doesn''t want editors
    to damage the pages or the project. The community of editors has values and norms,
    embedded in a strong tradition, and editors should also be good colleagues.'

    the *edit window*), add an edit summary in the field provided, and then click
    the Save Page button to create a new version of the page, which is immediately

    Every editor acts as a contributor, and vice versa; the term *editor* can be roughly
    equated with "someone who uses the Edit This Page tab." The traditional publishing
    roles of author, illustrator, editor (who makes substantive changes), copyeditor
    (who fixes grammar and style), and proofreader (who fixes typos) may be filled
    by any participant. Many contributors become specialists over time and choose
    to work primarily in one area or within structured projects on the site.

    syntax and formatting. The edit window is next; this window gives you a single
    undivided view of the *wikitext*, or source text, of the page you're editing.
    Here, you can change the text, the formatting, or both. Wikitext is formatted
    in a special markup language (*wikisyntax*), which is described in the second
    half of this chapter.

    article, as described in [Chapter 4](hw-wkpd-wk_05.html "Chapter 4. Understanding
    and Evaluating an Article"). The actual article content is often between two layers
    of wikitext. At the beginning of the source text but before the first words of
    the actual article, you may see some structured information: cleanup templates,
    hatnotes, image links, or an infobox with data presented in tabular form. Scrolling
    past this information and past the article text, you''ll find another layer of
    wikitext at the very end of the page; this information includes categories, stub
    templates, and possibly interwiki links. You can simply ignore this layer for
    the moment.'

    the formatting and improve the content.

    layer of wikitext, but not the top layer. If you're confused about a piece of
    syntax or formatting, you can always compare the source text to the *rendered
    page* (that is, the page as it appears on the Article tab). You might find it
    helpful to open two copies of the article you want to edit in different browser
    tabs or windows; use one window to edit and the other as a reminder of how the
    article appeared before you started editing.

    editors. Typical minor edits are spelling or grammatical corrections, adding a
    single internal link, fixing punctuation, or making small formatting or presentational
    changes. Though most minor edits change only a small amount of text, not all small
    edits are minor. Changing a single date in an article, say 1776 to 1667, is small
    but not minor. A minor edit should never substantially change the meaning of an
    article, and it should never be the subject of a debate.

    First, copy the text of your change into a word-processing document so you don't
    lose it. To see the wikisource with your changes, you must scroll down to the
    lower of the two windows on the page (the upper window contains the other editor's
    conflicting text). Then you can cancel the edit by clicking the back button in
    your browser. Next, refresh the page and check the last diff to see what changed
    in the previous version. Re-edit the page, integrating your change and the previous
    editor's work; don't simply paste your version on top. Edit conflicts are common
    only on high-traffic pages. Be warned, though, that if you save a page twice,
    perhaps thinking the first Save Page click didn't work, you might be in conflict
    with yourself! Note also that an edit conflict is not the same as an *edit war*,
    when two editors cannot agree on changes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistically speaking, as many as 20 percent of edits to Wikipedia are now
    reverted. Much of this is due to vandalism on popular articles. However, reverts
    should not be used to try and win arguments or impose your view on articles. To
    reinforce this, an official *Three-Revert Rule (3RR)* has been created, meaning
    that three reverts by any one person to a single article in a 24-hour period (except
    for vandalism control) is quite enough. In practice, editors with differences
    of opinion should discuss the issue and come to consensus on talk pages instead
    of reverting each other's changes in an article. A good rule of thumb is to revert
    only once before going to the talk page and making a rational case for your version.
    See [[Wikipedia:Three-revert rule]] (shortcut WP:3RR). Trying to get around 3RR
    is severely frowned upon, and users can be blocked for excessive reverting of
    the same article. This policy has gone a long way toward preventing *edit wars*,
    disputes between two or more editors where the same content is continually inserted
    and removed over a period of time.

    Protection comes in two flavors: full protection and semi-protection. Protected
    pages should be clearly identified with gray-bar template messages at the top

    or prone to constant vandalism, and these pages may be protected for longer; for
    instance, the article about the current President of the United States is subject
    to a constant stream of vandalism. Other articles may also fall under semi-protection
    because they are often vandalized by school students (some articles about elementary
    and high schools are particularly vulnerable). Some very visible page components,
    such as high-use templates, are also protected to prevent vandalism; sometimes
    this is done automatically through a mechanism called *cascading protection* in
    which the components that make up a fully protected page, such as the main page,
    are also protected.

    the protection status of pages. You can find out more at [[Wikipedia:Protection
    policy]] (shortcut WP:PROT). The [[Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages]]
    (shortcut WP:PERMPROT) lists pages with long-term protection. You can discuss
    any case of semi-protection on the talk page of the article, which will not be
    protected. If you feel an article needs semi-protection—for instance, if it is
    attracting a few dozen incidents of vandalism a day—add a note to [[Wikipedia:Requests

    and decide what to do.

    navigation elements or message boxes) that can be included on other pages. You
    can recognize templates by their appearance in the markup: A template placed in
    another page appears in the source text as the template name enclosed in double
    curly brackets, like *`{{message}}`* or *`{{mystatsbox}}`*. You can simply edit
    around these for the moment. Throughout the next several chapters, we''ll refer
    to useful templates for formatting and styling pages. If you want to use one,
    simply place it on the page by typing in the curly-bracket syntax exactly as it''s
    given, replacing any variable text as necessary (use the Show Preview button to
    see how it looks before you save the page). To learn more about templates and

    article. Opinions may differ on that. Still, redlinks introduced by others should
    only be removed if overlinking within the article is evident, or you can make
    a strong case that an encyclopedic article cannot or should not be written about
    the topic. Occasionally text will be mistakenly linked, and the link can be removed
    while keeping the text intact. In general, though, if you start removing redlinks,

    link to an external site; any external links can be used as references instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wikipedia has several guidelines about which external links to include. Types
    of sites that are welcome include pages directly relevant to the topic of the
    article (such as a company homepage for an article about a company), pages from
    reputable sources that contain further description or research that is accurate
    and on-topic, pages with information that could not be added to the article because
    of copyright or density of detail (such as professional athlete statistics or
    full film credits), or any other relevant content that may add to a reader's understanding
    of a topic but is not suitable for inclusion in an article (such as an interview).
    If an external page is used as a source for information in an article, it should
    be listed as a source and placed in the References section of the article rather
    than in the External links section. The sites in External links should provide
    additional information beyond that provided by source citations.
  prefs: []

- en: Though some external links are welcome, Wikipedia is not the place to include
    a comprehensive list of external links related to each topic—Wikipedia is not
    a directory. Typically, commercial pages or sites that only exist for selling
    a product are not included; the article about television should not include a
    list of links to companies that sell television sets (such link inclusions are
    generally removed as spam). In general, you should remember that Wikipedia is
    not meant for self-promotion; webmasters and web authors should not add links
    going to the websites they work on or for.

    From a search engine optimization standpoint, including a site in a Wikipedia

    webmasters from trying to use Wikipedia to boost their sites.

    as a source, whether as an inline link in the text or a link in the External links
    or References section. If you're trying to decide if a link is useful, check the
    page history to see who added the link and whether they provided an explanation
    for adding it. Removing links is a tricky business; if you're unsure, you can
    always post a quick message to the talk page.
  prefs: []

- en: Some whole sites should not be linked to. Wikimedia maintains a *blacklist*
    of these sites, which is incorporated into MediaWiki software. If a link to one
    of these sites is included in a page, you'll be unable to save the page; instead,
    you'll get a message prompting you to remove the offending link(s). (You might
    occasionally get this message even if you're not the person who added the link
    originally, for instance, if the link was not removed after blacklisting). The
    vast majority of blacklisted sites are pornography sites and commercial sites
    that have been consistently "spammed" on one or more projects (typically by being
    placed as links, sometimes automatically, on many unrelated articles). As the
    explanation for the list on Meta wiki says, "The spam blacklist exists primarily
    to control widespread spamming of Wikimedia Foundation projects. It is intended
    as a last resort for spam which spreads across multiple projects, and which is
    pursued by multiple individuals or IP addresses." See [[Wikipedia:Spam blacklist]]
    to suggest any additions or to appeal a decision. In addition to this restriction,
    any site that violates another's copyright (such as an illegally posted copy of
    a work) should not be linked to.

    that does depend on the topic. If a topic is connected with Germany, German speakers,
    or the German language, a link to a site in German is generally fine. Other instances
    where you might want to include a link to a non-English site are when the material
    the site covers is not available in English on the Web, authoritative information
    on the topic is typically published in that language, or the site is obviously
    scholarly and important.

    a site containing pages or isolated pieces of aggressive text and biased criticism
    or even defamation. In effect, an attack site is a propaganda website. Wikipedia
    does not wish to link to such sites, although some critical pieces may be linked
    to from articles, and some sites attached to organizations are mentioned even
    though their content may be offensive. Whether linking to some inoffensive parts
    of a site that offers links to worse material is acceptable has not been settled.
    These matters are typically decided by reference to Wikipedia's mission to compile
    an encyclopedic work and whether a link has anything to do with that. There is
    some trade-off between informing, on the one hand, and avoiding links to material
    that may offend, on the other. Linking to sites in order to harass other editors
    is entirely forbidden ([[Wikipedia:Harassment]], shortcut WP:HARASS, is a guideline
    dealing with onsite harassment).

    readers will read through it all, looking at that article in isolation. But that
    article is also there to give access to other articles. Although long articles
