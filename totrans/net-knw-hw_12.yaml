- en: File sharing requires a compromise between convenience and security. You want
    to make some of the files stored on your computer available to other people, but
    you probably have other files that contain information you would prefer to keep
    private. Therefore, Windows and other network operating systems allow you to assign
    different files or directories to different access levels. Some files are available
    to every network user, while others might be limited to specific users, and still
    others are only available to the file's owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most common network systems for sharing files, printers, and other
    resources is the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This protocol is at the
    core of Microsoft Windows networking, and it also works with Macintosh OS X and
    Linux/Unix systems. Therefore, exchanging files among computers that run different
    operating systems is not a problem, even though the files themselves might not
    always be compatible (for example, you probably can't run a program written for
    Windows on a Linux system).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many operating systems support more than one networking protocol, but when you
    run a mixed network, or if it's remotely possible that a visitor with a different
    kind of computer (such as a Mac or Linux laptop) might want to connect to your
    network, it's best to use the most common protocols.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Control of file sharing rests with the computer that holds each file, so other
    people can't open and read your files without your permission—even if they have
    a login account (or they're using a guest account) on the same computer. In order
    to share files with other users, you must turn on your operating system's file-sharing
    service and then assign an access level (universal, limited, or none) to each
    folder or directory. This chapter explains how to set up file sharing in Windows
    XP and Vista, Macintosh OS X, and in the Gnome and KDE environments used by many
    Linux and Unix distributions.
