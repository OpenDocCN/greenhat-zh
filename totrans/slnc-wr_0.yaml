- en: I seem to have been born a computer geek, but my adventure with network security
    began only by accident. I have always loved to experiment, explore new ideas,
    and solve seemingly well defined but still elusive challenges that require innovative
    and creative approaches—even if just to fail at solving them. When I was young,
    I spent most of my time pursuing sometimes risky and often silly attempts to explore
    the world of chemistry, mathematics, electronics, and finally computing rather
    than ride my bike around the block all day long. (I probably exaggerate a bit,
    but my mother always seemed to be worried.)

- en: 'Shortly after my first encounter with the Internet (in the mid ’90s, perhaps
    eight years after I coded my first “Hello world” program on a beloved 8-bit machine),
    I received an unusual request: a spam letter that, hard to believe, asked me (and
    a couple thousand other folks) to join an underground team of presumably malicious,
    black hat hackers. This did not drive me underground (perhaps due to my strong
    instinct for self-preservation, known in certain circles as cowardice) but somehow
    provided a good motivation to explore the field of computer security in more detail.
    Having done plenty of amateur programming, I found it captivating to look at code
    from a different perspective and to try to find a way for an algorithm to do something
    more than it was supposed to do. The Internet seemed a great resource for the
    challenges I craved—a big and complex system with only one guiding principle:
    You cannot really trust anyone. And so it all began.'

    specialist, a profession that is becoming commonplace today. I have never received
    any formal computer science education, nor do I hold an impressive-sounding set
    of certifications. Security has always been one of my primary passions (and is
    now my living). I am not the stereotypical computer geek—I do get up once in a
    while to look at my work from a sane distance or to get away from computers altogether.

    My goal is to show others how I view computer security, not how it is usually
    taught. For me, security is not a single problem to be solved nor a simple process
    to follow. It is not about expertise in a specific field. It is an exercise in
    seeing the entire ecosystem and understanding its every component.

- en: Even in the dim light of our monitors, we are still only humans. We were taught
    to trust others, and we do not want to be too paranoid. We need to find a sensible
    compromise between security and productivity to live comfortably.

- en: The Internet is, nevertheless, different from a real-world society. There is
    no common benefit from conforming to the rules, and there is seldom any remorse
    for virtual misdeeds. We cannot simply trust the system, and our attempts to come
    up with a single rule that can be applied to all problems will fail miserably.
    We instinctively draw a straight line to separate “us” from “them” and call our
    own island safe. Then, we look out for rogue ships on the horizon. Soon, security
    problems start to appear as localized abnormalities that can be easily defined,
    diagnosed, and resolved. From that perspective, attackers appear to be driven
    by clear motives, and if we are vigilant, we can see them and stop them as they
    approach.

- en: 'Yet, the virtual world is quite different: security is not the absence of bugs;
    safety does not lie in being beyond the reach of attackers. Just about any process
    involving information has inherent security implications, which are visible to
    us the moment we look beyond the scope of the goal the process tries to achieve.
    The art of understanding security is simply the art of being able to cross the
    line and look from a different perspective.'

- en: This is an unconventional book, or so I hope. It is not a compendium of problems
    or a guide to securing your systems. It begins with an attempt to follow the story
    of a piece of information, from the moment your hands touch the keyboard, all
    the way to the remote party on the other end of the wire. It covers the technology
    and its security implications, focusing on problems that cannot be qualified as
    bugs, with no attacker, no flaw to be analyzed and resolved, or no detectable
    attack (or at least not one that we can distinguish from legitimate activity).
    The goal of this book is to demonstrate that the only way to understand the Internet
    is to have the courage to go beyond the specifications or read between the lines.

- en: As the subtitle suggests, this book focuses on privacy and security problems
    inherent to everyday communications and computing. Some of them have profound
    implications, while others are simply interesting and stimulating. None will have
    an immediate damaging impact on your environment or destroy the data on your disk
    drive. The information here is useful and valuable to IT professionals and seasoned
    amateurs who want to be challenged to exercise their minds and who want to learn
    about the nonobvious consequences of design decisions. This is a book for those
    who want to learn how to use these subtleties to take control of their environment
    and gain an advantage over the world outside.

- en: The book is divided into four sections. The first three cover stages of data
    flow and technologies deployed there. The last section focuses on the network
    as a whole. Every chapter covers relevant elements of the technology used to process
    the data at each stage, a discussion of security implications, a demonstration
    of its side-effects, suggestions on how to address the problems (if possible),
    and recommendations for how to further explore the subject. I do my best to avoid
    charts, tables, pages of specifications, and so forth (though you will find numerous
    footnotes). Since you can easily find plenty of good reference materials online,
    my focus is on making this book simply enjoyable.
