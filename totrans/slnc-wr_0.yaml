  zh: 关于我的一些话
- en: I seem to have been born a computer geek, but my adventure with network security
    began only by accident. I have always loved to experiment, explore new ideas,
    and solve seemingly well defined but still elusive challenges that require innovative
    and creative approaches—even if just to fail at solving them. When I was young,
    I spent most of my time pursuing sometimes risky and often silly attempts to explore
    the world of chemistry, mathematics, electronics, and finally computing rather
    than ride my bike around the block all day long. (I probably exaggerate a bit,
    but my mother always seemed to be worried.)

  zh: 我似乎天生就是计算机极客，但我的网络安全冒险之旅只是偶然开始的。我总是喜欢实验，探索新想法，解决看似明确但仍然难以捉摸的挑战，这些挑战需要创新和创造性的方法——即使只是失败地尝试解决它们。当我年轻的时候，我大部分时间都在追求有时冒险、经常愚蠢的尝试，去探索化学、数学、电子学和最终的计算世界，而不是整天在街区骑自行车。（我可能有点夸张，但我的母亲似乎总是担心。）
- en: 'Shortly after my first encounter with the Internet (in the mid ’90s, perhaps
    eight years after I coded my first “Hello world” program on a beloved 8-bit machine),
    I received an unusual request: a spam letter that, hard to believe, asked me (and
    a couple thousand other folks) to join an underground team of presumably malicious,
    black hat hackers. This did not drive me underground (perhaps due to my strong
    instinct for self-preservation, known in certain circles as cowardice) but somehow
    provided a good motivation to explore the field of computer security in more detail.
    Having done plenty of amateur programming, I found it captivating to look at code
    from a different perspective and to try to find a way for an algorithm to do something
    more than it was supposed to do. The Internet seemed a great resource for the
    challenges I craved—a big and complex system with only one guiding principle:
    You cannot really trust anyone. And so it all began.'

  zh: 在我第一次接触互联网（可能在90年代中期，也就是在我第一次在心爱的8位机器上编写我的第一个“Hello world”程序后的八年左右）之后不久，我收到了一个不同寻常的请求：一封垃圾邮件，难以置信的是，它要求我（以及两千多人）加入一个据说是恶意、黑帽黑客的地下团队。这并没有让我躲进地下（或许是因为我强烈的自我保护本能，在某些圈子中被认为是懦弱）但不知何故，这给了我一个深入了解计算机安全领域的良好动机。在做了很多业余编程之后，我发现从不同的角度审视代码，并尝试找到一种让算法做比预期更多事情的方法，这让我着迷。互联网似乎是一个巨大的资源，对于我渴望的挑战——一个庞大而复杂的系统，只有一个指导原则：你无法真正信任任何人。于是，一切就这样开始了。
- en: I do not have the background you might expect from the usual computer security
    specialist, a profession that is becoming commonplace today. I have never received
    any formal computer science education, nor do I hold an impressive-sounding set
    of certifications. Security has always been one of my primary passions (and is
    now my living). I am not the stereotypical computer geek—I do get up once in a
    while to look at my work from a sane distance or to get away from computers altogether.

  zh: 我没有你可能会从通常的计算机安全专家那里期望的背景，这个职业现在正变得司空见惯。我从未接受过任何正式的计算机科学教育，也没有持有令人印象深刻的证书。安全一直是我主要的激情之一（现在是我的生计）。我不是典型的计算机极客——我偶尔也会站起来，从理智的距离审视我的工作，或者完全远离电脑。
- en: For good or bad, all this has affected the shape of this book and its message.
    My goal is to show others how I view computer security, not how it is usually
    taught. For me, security is not a single problem to be solved nor a simple process
    to follow. It is not about expertise in a specific field. It is an exercise in
    seeing the entire ecosystem and understanding its every component.

  zh: 无论好坏，所有这些都影响了这本书的形状和其信息。我的目标是向其他人展示我是如何看待计算机安全的，而不是通常是如何教授的。对我来说，安全不是一个需要解决的问题，也不是一个简单的流程。它不是关于特定领域的专业知识。它是观察整个生态系统并理解其每个组成部分的练习。

  zh: 关于这本书
- en: Even in the dim light of our monitors, we are still only humans. We were taught
    to trust others, and we do not want to be too paranoid. We need to find a sensible
    compromise between security and productivity to live comfortably.

  zh: 即使在我们的显示器昏暗的光线下，我们仍然是人类。我们被教导要信任他人，我们不想过于偏执。我们需要在安全和生产力之间找到一个合理的折衷方案，以便舒适地生活。
- en: The Internet is, nevertheless, different from a real-world society. There is
    no common benefit from conforming to the rules, and there is seldom any remorse
    for virtual misdeeds. We cannot simply trust the system, and our attempts to come
    up with a single rule that can be applied to all problems will fail miserably.
    We instinctively draw a straight line to separate “us” from “them” and call our
    own island safe. Then, we look out for rogue ships on the horizon. Soon, security
    problems start to appear as localized abnormalities that can be easily defined,
    diagnosed, and resolved. From that perspective, attackers appear to be driven
    by clear motives, and if we are vigilant, we can see them and stop them as they
    approach.

  zh: 互联网与现实世界社会不同。遵守规则没有共同的好处，对于虚拟世界的错误行为也鲜有悔恨。我们不能简单地信任系统，我们试图提出一个适用于所有问题的单一规则的努力将注定失败。我们本能地划出一条直线来区分“我们”和“他们”，并称我们的岛屿是安全的。然后，我们警惕地观察地平线上的海盗船。很快，安全问题开始以局部异常的形式出现，这些异常可以轻易地定义、诊断和解决。从那个角度来看，攻击者似乎被明确的目标所驱动，如果我们保持警惕，我们就可以在他们接近时看到他们并阻止他们。
- en: 'Yet, the virtual world is quite different: security is not the absence of bugs;
    safety does not lie in being beyond the reach of attackers. Just about any process
    involving information has inherent security implications, which are visible to
    us the moment we look beyond the scope of the goal the process tries to achieve.
    The art of understanding security is simply the art of being able to cross the
    line and look from a different perspective.'

  zh: 然而，虚拟世界却截然不同：安全不是没有错误；安全不在于超越攻击者的触及范围。几乎任何涉及信息的过程都有固有的安全影响，一旦我们超越该过程试图实现的目标范围，这些影响就会显现出来。理解安全的艺术就是能够跨越界限，从不同的角度看待问题。
- en: This is an unconventional book, or so I hope. It is not a compendium of problems
    or a guide to securing your systems. It begins with an attempt to follow the story
    of a piece of information, from the moment your hands touch the keyboard, all
    the way to the remote party on the other end of the wire. It covers the technology
    and its security implications, focusing on problems that cannot be qualified as
    bugs, with no attacker, no flaw to be analyzed and resolved, or no detectable
    attack (or at least not one that we can distinguish from legitimate activity).
    The goal of this book is to demonstrate that the only way to understand the Internet
    is to have the courage to go beyond the specifications or read between the lines.

  zh: 这是一本非常规的书，我希望如此。它不是问题汇编或系统安全指南。它从尝试追踪一条信息的故事开始，从你触摸键盘的那一刻起，一直到线那头的远程对方。它涵盖了技术和其安全影响，重点关注那些不能被定性为错误的问题，没有攻击者，没有需要分析和解决的错误，或者没有可检测的攻击（或者至少不是我们可以从合法活动中区分出来的攻击）。本书的目标是证明理解互联网的唯一方法就是有勇气超越规范或读出字里行间的含义。
- en: As the subtitle suggests, this book focuses on privacy and security problems
    inherent to everyday communications and computing. Some of them have profound
    implications, while others are simply interesting and stimulating. None will have
    an immediate damaging impact on your environment or destroy the data on your disk
    drive. The information here is useful and valuable to IT professionals and seasoned
    amateurs who want to be challenged to exercise their minds and who want to learn
    about the nonobvious consequences of design decisions. This is a book for those
    who want to learn how to use these subtleties to take control of their environment
    and gain an advantage over the world outside.

  zh: 如副标题所示，本书关注于日常通信和计算中固有的隐私和安全问题。其中一些问题具有深远的影响，而另一些则仅仅是有趣和启发性的。这些问题都不会立即对你的环境造成损害，也不会破坏你的硬盘上的数据。这里的信息对IT专业人士和经验丰富的业余爱好者来说非常有用和宝贵，他们希望通过挑战来锻炼自己的思维，并了解设计决策的非显而易见后果。这是一本面向那些想学习如何利用这些微妙之处来掌控自己的环境并在外部世界中取得优势的人的书。
- en: The book is divided into four sections. The first three cover stages of data
    flow and technologies deployed there. The last section focuses on the network
    as a whole. Every chapter covers relevant elements of the technology used to process
    the data at each stage, a discussion of security implications, a demonstration
    of its side-effects, suggestions on how to address the problems (if possible),
    and recommendations for how to further explore the subject. I do my best to avoid
    charts, tables, pages of specifications, and so forth (though you will find numerous
    footnotes). Since you can easily find plenty of good reference materials online,
    my focus is on making this book simply enjoyable.

  zh: 本书分为四个部分。前三个部分涵盖了数据流和部署的技术阶段。最后一部分专注于整个网络。每一章都涵盖了在每个阶段处理数据所使用的技术的相关元素，对安全影响的讨论，展示其副作用，以及如何解决问题的建议（如果可能的话），以及如何进一步探索主题的建议。我尽力避免图表、表格、规格说明书等（尽管你会在脚注中找到很多）。由于你可以在网上轻松找到大量的优质参考资料，我的重点是让这本书简单易懂。
