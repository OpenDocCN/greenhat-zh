There
    are multitudes of playback devices, and audio quality is excellent even on
    inexpensive CD players. But when you want higher fidelity or larger
    storage capacity than an audio CD (how about seven CDs’ worth on a single
    DVD?), what do you do?<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0001" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0002" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0004" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You may feel like you are being shunned because all the attention is
    being given to newer and better video formats and the only audio lovers
    getting any attention are MP3 consumers. Lossy formats and tiny portable
    devices with lo-fi earbuds are getting all the glory, while audiophiles
    are stuck with aging formats and technologies that haven’t advanced in
    years. Adding insult to injury is the never-ending parade of ineffective,
    hostile DRM (which stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>digital rights
    management</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>digital restrictions
    management</em></span>—take your pick) follies that are infesting new video
    and audio playback technologies, like termites in new houses.</p><p>Fortunately, there are some options for the golden-eared digital
    audiophile. In this chapter, we’re going to look at DVD-Audio. DVD-Audio
    is a special digital audio format for DVD; it is not the same as the audio
    formats used in DVD movies. You’ll sacrifice some portability because it
    is not as well supported as CD audio, but a number of home and vehicle DVD
    players support it.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0009" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0010" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0011" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0012" class="indexterm"/></p><p>CD audio supports only two-channel 16/44.1 sound. DVD-Audio supports
    very high-resolution audio, all the way up to 24/192 and up to six-channel
    surround sound. Audacity, from version 1.3.3, also supports these
    features.</p><p>If you don’t want super-duper high fidelity, you can store a passel
    of music on a DVD. You don’t need any special hardware to create DVD-Audio
    disks; you need just an ordinary computer DVD writer and blank DVD media.
    You do need special authoring software to create the correct type of DVD
    disk image, and you have to use PCM-type audio file formats such as FLAC,
    WAV, and AIFF. I like FLAC because it’s an open, high-quality lossless,
    compressed format that creates files that are 30 percent to 50 percent
    smaller than WAV and AIFF.</p><p>Some examples of DVD-authoring software are DVD-AUDIO Solo Plus
    (Windows), Minnetonka Audio Software discWelder (Mac and Windows),
    Steinberg Wavelab (Windows), and DVD Audio Tools for Linux.

      devices, for there is a whole world of high-fidelity digital audio to
      explore. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD">Chapter 3</a>, digital audio has
      many advantages over analog audio. Audacity has native support for three
      high-quality PCM audio formats: WAV, AIFF, and FLAC. WAV and AIFF are
      pretty much the same thing.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Waveform Audio Format (WAV)</em></span> was developed by
      IBM and Microsoft from the Interchange File Format (IFF), which was
      developed by Electronic Arts (EA) and Commodore-Amiga in the mid-1980s.
      IFF can carry text, image, or audio data, and it was intended to be a
      generic wrapper for exchanging different types of data across diverse
      platforms.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0021" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)</em></span> was
      developed by Apple, and it is also based on IFF. There are small
      technical differences between WAV and AIFF because they were developed
      to run on different operating systems, but these days both are well
      supported by most software media players.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0022" class="indexterm"/></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)</em></span> is a
      high-quality lossless compressed format. It is an open and unencumbered
      standard. Online music services such as Magnatune, the Philadelphia
      Orchestra online music store, and Linn Records offer downloads in FLAC
      format because it is equal in quality to WAV in a smaller file size.
      FLAC is well supported and growing in popularity.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0024" class="indexterm"/></p><p>FLAC, WAV, and AIFF are linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM).

<div class="sect1" title="DVD-Audio Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="dvd-audio_overview"/>DVD-Audio Overview</h1></div></div></div><p>DVD-Audio is a digital audio format for DVDs. It is not the same
      as the audio formats used in DVD movies but is a different format just
      for audio. DVD movies use various compressed, lossy audio formats to
      preserve disk space, which even on a DVD is at a premium when you
      combine movie-length video and multichannel surround sound. DVD-Audio
      supports professional studio master audio quality, which is 24/192. If
      you’re content with CD audio (16/44.1 stereo), you can cram about seven
      hours’ worth onto a single standard 4.7GB DVD. At 24/192, you’ll get
      about 75 minutes of music on a standard DVD. Some DVD-authoring software
      supports writing to 8.5GB double-layer DVDs, so you can really pile in
      the tunes. The DVD-Audio standard also supports still pictures and video
      menus.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Sometimes home-burned double-layer DVDs are not reliable on
        different playback devices. Stick with the good-quality brands of DVD
        blanks and make sure that your DVD player supports both double-layer
        DVD-R and DVD-Audio. Your particular DVD writer may work better with
        specific brands of blanks, so use what your manufacturer
        recommends.</p></div><p>DVD-Audio is an LPCM format like WAV and AIFF. It supports bit
      depths of 16, 20, and 24 and sampling rates up to 192 kHz. Audacity
      supports 16- and 24-bit depths and pretty much any sampling rate you
      want. If the rate you want isn’t in the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Quality</strong></span> dialog, just enter your own in
      <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Quality</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Default
      Sample Rate</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Other</strong></span>.</p><p>DVD-Audio has a theoretical dynamic range of 144 dB, though the
      limitations of audio hardware mean your maximum dynamic range is always
      about 120 dB. Dynamic range in this context isn’t about cranking the
      volume or blasting your listeners with sudden extreme peaks; the
      advantages of an extremely wide dynamic range are loads of headroom for
      recording and processing and a very low noise floor.</p><p>DVD-Audio supports a range of stereo and surround channel
      combinations at 24 bits: 1.0 mono and 2.0 stereo at sampling rates of
      44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, and 192 kHz.</p><p>These all support sampling rates of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz,
      and 96 kHz at 24 bits:<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0036" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0037" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0038" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0039" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0040" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0041" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0042" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>2.1 stereo (left, right, LFE)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>3.0 (left, right, surround)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>3.1 (left, right, surround, LFE)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>4.0 (left, right, center, surround)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>4.1 (left, right, center, surround, LFE)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>5.0 (left, right, center, surround right, surround

          LFE)</p></li></ul></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>low-frequency effects</em></span> (LFE) channel
      deserves a bit of explanation. It’s often assumed to be the subwoofer
      channel, but this is not quite right. The LFE channel is a special
      channel that carries sounds in the 3 Hz to 200 Hz frequency range, and
      the LFE signal can be sent to any speaker capable of handling this
      range.</p><p>Uncompressed DVD-Audio has a bitrate limit of 9.6Mbps, so you can
      have glorious 24/192 two-channel stereo. But you’re not going to get
      uncompressed 5.1 surround at full 24/192 resolution because 9.6Mbps is
      not enough bandwidth for full resolution on all of those channels. The
      best you’ll get is 24/96 in 5.1. You can have different resolutions on
      different channels, such as 24/96 for the two front channels and 16/48
      on the surround channels. You need compression to get higher resolution
      for 5.1, and the only compression supported by the DVD-Audio standard is
      the proprietary Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) lossless compression. A
      license for MLP is expensive, usually more than $2,000, and available
      only for Windows and Mac authoring software.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0043" class="indexterm"/></p></div>

      create. This does not necessarily mean recording at the highest possible
      sampling and bitrates, but using good recording techniques to produce
      the best-sounding recordings. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap">Chapter 2</a>, a lot of factors
      affect the quality of your audio recordings: background noise,
      microphone placement, the quality of your mics, preamp,
      analog-to-digital converter, and the power of your computer.</p><p>Audacity supports up to 32/192 recording, so let’s see what the
      pros and cons are of using higher resolutions.</p><div class="sect2" title="More Power"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="more_power"/>More Power</h2></div></div></div><p>You need a stout CPU to handle high-resolution recording. I have
        one PC with an Athlon LE-1620 2.4 GHz and 4GB of RAM. It is a
        single-core CPU, and it bogs down at sampling rates higher than 48
        kHz. Multicore CPUs are wonderful for audio production. Audacity is
        not designed to take advantage of multiple cores, but you’ll still see
        a significant performance improvement because your operating system
        will use those extra cores for other tasks, which frees up CPU cycles
        for Audacity. I also have a system with a three-core CPU (AMD Phenom
        X3), and it handles eight channels at 24/96 with no trouble (using a
        Focusrite Saffire Pro 26 I/O FireWire recording interface).<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0044" class="indexterm"/></p><p>I haven’t noticed any advantage in having more than 4GB RAM, but
        memory is so cheap it doesn’t hurt to load up. (See <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality">Chapter 14</a> to learn about
        tuning your computer for best audio performance.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="What Bit Depth Is Best?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="what_bit_depth_is_best_question"/>What Bit Depth Is Best?</h2></div></div></div><p>The Audacity documentation recommends recording at 32-bit float
        and then downsampling to your desired bit depth for your final export.
        So even though your final product is 24 or 16 bit, starting from
        32-bit float results in higher quality than recording in 24- or 16-bit
        integer. This is true even if your recording interface supports only
        16 bits. You will always downsample because there are no 32-bit
        playback devices; you must always export to 24-bit or lower integer
        (also called <span class="emphasis"><em>linear</em></span>) formats. 32-bit float is
        always an intermediate step, not the final result.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0045" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0046" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Let’s talk about what 32-bit float is, since it is rather
        misunderstood. Integers are whole numbers, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>float</em></span> means floating decimal point. A 32-bit
        float number is a 24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. 32-bit float
        means great precision and very high resolution. You get a smoother,
        more accurate response curve across the whole range of your
        analog-to-digital conversion.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0047" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Bit depth controls dynamic range, and in audio production
        dynamic range is very important. Each bit equals about 6 dB dynamic
        range. So, 16-bit has a dynamic range of 96 dB, 24-bit is 144 dB, and
        32-bit float is about 1,500 dB; 32-bit integer is 196 dB. There are
        limitations in electronic hardware that limit actual dynamic range to
        a maximum of about 120 dB, and most people don’t care to listen to
        music with a dynamic range greater than 50 dB, which is quite a lot.
        So what’s the point of having very wide dynamic range? The value of
        all that dynamic range is abundant headroom for editing, lowest noise,
        less risk of clipping, and lossless exports to lower bit
        depths.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0048" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Those extra eight bits make all the difference when you’re doing
        a lot of manipulation and effects. You can mangle your 32-bit files to
        your heart’s content and when you’re finished make a lossless 24-bit
        export. If you started from a 24-bit file, applied a lot of
        processing, and finished with a 24-bit export, you would likely
        introduce some noise and experience some loss of quality.</p><p>We dinosaurs from the analog era have a habit of pushing
        recording levels as close to the red line as possible, because there
        were good reasons for doing so. Even the best analog tapes and
        recorders created a bit of hiss and had a relatively narrow dynamic
        range, so we had to push the limits of signal to noise to minimize
        this. Going a bit over the red line didn’t matter very much with
        analog audio because it was a gradual effect—at +2 or +3 the
        distortion was bothersome only to the fussiest of listeners. At +4 or
        +5 you were a cool rock band. In digital audio it’s all or
        nothing—when a signal passes 0 dB, everything over zero is discarded,
        or clipped. You might hear an audible click or something similar to
        the familiar analog distortion buzz. It’s easy to hear for yourself.
        Just plug in a mic, crank up the gain, and talk loudly. Or use
        <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Tone</strong></span> to create a sine wave, and then use
        <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Amplify</strong></span> to crank it way up over zero. You can
        find clipped segments easily by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Show
        Clipping</strong></span>, which uses red bars to mark clipped
        passages.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0049" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0050" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0051" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0053" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0054" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Some documentation says that recording at 32-bit float means
        virtually no distortion, even if you go over 0 dB. But there are
        several variables that affect any sounds that go over 0 dB, mainly the
        software processing your sounds. Different Audacity plug-ins, or any
        other software that you might use, will process sounds over 0 dB in
        different ways, so you could still get clipping and create distortion.
        It’s not necessary to push your recording levels that high anyway
        since you have dynamic range to burn.</p><p>The short story is that the 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit depths
        all offer more dynamic range than you’ll ever be able to use, so
        you’ll have plenty of headroom with any of them. When you’re recording
        at 24-bit depth, you can handily afford to throw away the top 12 dB.
        At 16 bits you can set your peaks to -6 or -9 dB and have no worries.
        Audacity’s 32-bit float means you can record to a peak of -24 dB,
        which is helpful at a live show to allow for unexpected peaks.</p><p>Of course, there are downsides to recording at high bit depths
        and sampling rates. Higher resolutions eat up disk space and require
        more CPU power (<a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#how_much_disk_space_per_stereo" title="Table 6-1. How Much Disk Space per Stereo Minute Is Used by Different Bit Depth/Sampling Rate Combinations">Table 6-1</a>).</p><div class="table"><a id="how_much_disk_space_per_stereo"/><p class="title">Table 6-1. How Much Disk Space per Stereo Minute Is Used by Different

        terrible. If you like skips, pops, and fuzz, it’s better to add them
        on purpose as special effects.</p><p>Consider the complexity of what you’re recording. Simple voice
        recordings, such as an audio book or podcast, don’t benefit much from
        super-high resolutions. A solo singer or instrumentalist or a small
        band can be captured perfectly at 16/44.1, while a symphony orchestra
        will use everything you have.</p><p>So the answer to the question “Which one is best?” once again is
        “It depends.” If you have enough computer power and storage, recording
        at 32-bit float with any sampling rate gives you loads of elbow room
        for all kinds of editing and exporting. You can always go downward,
        but you can’t go upward. On the other hand, if you are careful and
        skilled, all the links in your audio chain are good quality, and your

        sampling rates? As we learned in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Audacity from Start to Finish">Chapter 1</a>, sampling rates determine
        frequency range. The frequency range is about half the sampling rate.
        The best human hearing has a range of about 20 Hz to 22 kHz, so a
        sampling rate of 44.1 kHz should cover the range of human hearing. The
        better audio hardware has an upper limit of 20 to 30 kHz.</p><p>But it’s not quite that simple. Some studies seem to indicate
        that very high frequencies are still perceived in some manner and add
        to the listener’s enjoyment. What they might be talking about are the
        harmonics. If you have a sound at 100 Hz, there are harmonics of that
        sound at 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 200 Hz, and so on. When you limit the frequency
        range, you also limit the harmonics.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0070" class="indexterm"/></p><p>If you have good hearing and are fussy about your music, I wager
        you’ll be happier with 24 bits than 16. In my experience, bit depth
        makes a more obvious difference than sampling rates. I record at
        32-bit float/48 and export to 24/48 when I want best quality. Don’t
        upsample, because all that does is add bits without adding quality,
        and most likely it will sound a little worse.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Saving Your Masters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="saving_your_masters"/>Saving Your Masters</h2></div></div></div><p>Audacity project (<span class="emphasis"><em>.aup</em></span>) files are not quite
        adequate for archiving, because every time you edit a project they
        change. They are fast and efficient work-spaces. But project files
        have been known to be fragile; if a project becomes corrupted, you
        have only Audacity’s automatic recovery mechanism to fix it. If that
        fails, game over. A good way to archive your studio masters is to
        export them as WAVs or FLACs. The highest quality is a 32-bit float
        WAV. (Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>.) Then you won’t lose so much as a
        bit and will always have a high-quality master. FLAC maxes out at
        24-bit integer, which is still a lot of bits, and FLAC files are
        smaller than WAV.</p><p>Multitrack recordings take a bit of care to preserve as WAVs or
        FLACs, because the Audacity track names and channel mappings get lost
        at export and are preserved only in your Audacity project files. If
        you export a big multitrack project as a single file, you’ll get all
        your tracks back but without their track names. Instead, they will all
        have the filename. If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span>, which exports each track into an
        individual file, the track names will become the filenames.</p><p>I save both Audacity project files and 32-bit float WAV masters.

        Audio CD (SACD)?” SACD is not an option for the home or small studio
        because the recorders are very expensive, plus you must pay format
        license and patent fees, which is a shame, because it’s a real
        breakthrough. SACD takes one-bit samples at a 2.82 MHz sampling rate.
        That’s right, 2.82 million times per second. That is a tad more than
        the standard Red Book CD sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. On paper, it’s
        closer to an analog waveform than any other digital format. SACD does
        not use pulse code modulation (PCM) but a new method of recording and
        playback that is called Direct Stream Digital (DSD). PCM requires
        interpolation and oversampling filters, while DSD employs a more
        direct, less-complex signal path. SACD has a potential dynamic range
        of around 100 dB.<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0119" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0120" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0121" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0122" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It seems that vendors of both SACD and DVD-Audio became bogged
        down in DRM nonsense, rather than marketing these high-quality formats
        in a pleasing and attractive manner, so both have been slow to gain
        traction in the marketplace. I think they are both going to fade away
        eventually.</p></div></div>
