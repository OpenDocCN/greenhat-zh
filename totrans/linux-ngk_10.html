</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">You’ve learned how to install RPM  packages via the Package Manager and  directly via the double-click method.  However, believe it or not, there is yet a third  way, called APT (Advanced Package Tool), to  install new RPM-based software. In fact, anyone familiar  with the Linux Debian distro or with the Fink program on  Mac OS X will probably already be familiar with the APT  program. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The Debian version of APT is designed to download special Debian APT  packages from which it installs a program and all its dependencies. These APT packages, however, do not work on Fedora because they are not RPMs. There is,  however, a special variation on the original Debian version of APT that is designed to  work on RPM-based systems, such as Fedora Core. APT connects to an RPM repository on the Internet and then downloads all the programs you select, as  well as the dependencies for those programs. The programs are downloaded as  RPM files, which APT then installs on your system.<a name="456" id="456"/><a name="IDX-144" id="IDX-144"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">APT is a very easy, safe, and foolproof way of installing programs, because  nothing will go missing, and it makes dependency hell pretty much a thing of the  past. Of course, not every program or file is available in an APT repository, so the  other methods you have learned so far are not for naught. There are also still  other applications that are not available as RPMs at all, but you will learn how to  deal with those in the <a href="DDU0084_split_000.html#488" target="_parent">next chapter</a>. Nevertheless, there are plenty of files that  you can download and install, or (very importantly) just update, via APT.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The one thing about APT that some people might consider a problem is that  it is a command-driven application. This means that you have to run it via  commands in the Linux Command Terminal. Fortunately, you can avoid this  more cumbersome way of doing things by installing the program Synaptic, which  is a graphical front end for APT. Synaptic allows you to use APT graphically, and  thus quite easily.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Finally, there are a variety of APT repositories on the Internet, and the  version of APT offered at these various repositories is usually preconfigured to  download RPMs from that particular repository. In addition, the packages from  one repository are not guaranteed to be compatible with those from another,  meaning that conflicts could occur if you mix files from different repositories (though I must admit to having never had problems myself in this regard). To  stay on the safe side and keep things convenient, user-friendly, and aesthetically  pleasing, we will be using the repositories at Freshrpms for APT, and for RPMs  not available from Freshrpms, we will use, whenever possible, the Freshrpms- compatible DAG repository, from which you will download several RPMs while  performing some of the projects in this book. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In this project, you will install the APT program, which comes in the form of an  easy-to-install RPM. Once you install APT, you will then use it by command line  to install its graphical front end, Synaptic. All in all, both steps are very easy.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get started, the only file you will need is the one for APT. You can get this by  going to <a target="_top" href="http://freshrpms.net/packages/">http://freshrpms.net/packages/</a> and clicking the link appropriate for  the version of Linux you are running. After the new page appears, go to the left  side of the page and click the <b class="calibre13">apt</b> link, which will take you to the page for that  package. You will see the APT file listed at the top of the page. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To download the file, just right-click the tiny floppy-disk icon to the left of  the filename, and then select <b class="calibre13">Save Link Target As</b> in the pop-up menu. You do  not need the <b class="calibre13">apt-devel</b> file, so don’t bother with that. </p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As APT comes in the form of an RPM file, installation is a breeze, as you now  know. Just double-click the RPM file, and then follow the usual RPM installation  procedures that you learned in <a href="DDU0064_split_000.html#345" target="_parent">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If your Internet service provider requires you to connect to the Internet via a  proxy server, you will have to add your proxy settings to APT before you can do  any updating or downloading. If you do not connect to the Internet via a proxy  server, you can skip directly to the next step in the project (10A-3). </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Inputting proxy settings in most programs is easily done in the Preferences  window for that program. In the case of APT, it is a tad more complicated, but  just a tad. To input your proxy settings for APT, you will need to open the <b class="calibre13">apt.conf</b> file. As this file is in root territory, you will have to open and alter it after  becoming root. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To get started, open a Terminal window and become root. Once you’ve  done that, type <span>gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf</span> and press ENTER. This will open up the  apt.conf file in the Gedit text editor (in root mode). Once the file is open, scroll  through it and look for an entry beginning with the word <b class="calibre13">Acquire</b>. When you  find it, change it so that it looks similar to the entry in the following example, but  use the proxy and port information supplied by your service provider or network  administrator.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">Acquire {
    Retries "0";
    Http {
        Proxy "http://proxy.yourserver.com:3128/"; </pre>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">In case your provider gives you the proxy address and port number separately  (for example, <a target="_top" href="http://proxy.magnumopus.se">http://proxy.magnumopus.se</a> and port 6048), type a colon after  the address and then add the port number after the colon. Using the previous  example, that would be <a target="_top" href="http://proxy.magnumopus.se:6048/">http://proxy.magnumopus.se:6048/.</a> Yours will no  doubt be different.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now that APT is installed on your system, you are almost ready to use it. I say  “almost” because you first have to tell APT to update its database so that it will  know what is available for download from the online repositories and what you  have already installed on your system in RPM form. To perform the update, open  a Terminal window, become root using the <b class="calibre13">su</b> command, and then type<span> apt-get update</span> and press ENTER.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Checking your system and the repositories should take APT a couple of  minutes the first time around, so just be patient and ponder your future (or  something) until your prompt reappears. Once it does reappear, you will be  ready for action.<a name="462" id="462"/><a name="IDX-145" id="IDX-145"/>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Your first taste of using APT via the command line (and probably the last you’ll  want to have with it) is to download and install Synaptic, the graphical front end  for APT. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The general format for the command to download and install a package via  APT is: <span>apt-get install package_name</span>. In this case, you are going to be installing  Synaptic, so open a Terminal window, become root, and then type <span>apt-get install synaptic</span> and press ENTER. APT will then begin downloading Synaptic, and, once it’s done doing that, it will go on to install it. During this time, APT will show you  its progress, as you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU106">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now you are ready to get some experience using Synaptic, while at the same  time rounding out your system a bit by installing a player for your MPEG and  QuickTime video files. The program is called MPlayer (shown in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU107">Figure 10-2</a>),  and it is a very handy program that plays a variety of video formats, DVDs, VCDs,  some video streams, and even audio files. </p>
<div class="calibre10">

<br class="calibre16"/>
<span><span>Figure 10-2: </span> The MPlayer video player</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">As you can see in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU107">Figure 10-2</a>, MPlayer has separate control and view  windows. If you prefer a single-window approach, or you want the ability to  capture video frames as still images, you might want to try out gxine instead  (shown in <a>Figure 10-3</a>), which is otherwise quite similar to MPlayer in terms of  its capabilities (though it can seem a bit buggier at times).<a name="467" id="467"/><a name="IDX-146" id="IDX-146"/>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Of course, some people may have no need for video playback at all, and thus may  not wish to devote so much download time for a program that will go unused. If  you are such a person, and you choose not to download MPlayer (or you choose  to download gxine instead), you should download the MP3 encoder LAME,  which is normally downloaded as one of the dependencies for MPlayer. LAME is  used to convert WAV sound files (like those on an audio CD) into the popular  space-saving MP3 sound files. You will need LAME installed on your machine by  the time you reach <a href="DDU0092_split_000.html#549" target="_parent">Chapter 13</a>, where you will be learning more about this  encoding process.<a name="470" id="470"/><a name="IDX-148" id="IDX-148"/>
</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The instructions for installing gxine and LAME, or LAME by itself, are essentially  the same as for installing MPlayer; just substitute <b class="calibre13">gxine</b> or <b class="calibre13">lame</b> for <b class="calibre13">mplayer</b> in the  instructions that follow.</p>

</h3>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Before you begin, I should mention that the download for MPlayer and all its dependencies is rather hefty (about 13MB), so make sure you give yourself some  time to do this. All in all, the entire process should take about twenty minutes or  more (depending on your Internet connection speed), but during most of this  time, you won’t have to do anything other than wait. This is all time well spent, as  many of these dependencies are items that will prove useful to you later on, when  you are using other programs.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Anyway, the first thing you’ll want to do is run Synaptic, which you can do by  going to the Main menu and selecting <b class="calibre13">System Tools </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Synaptic</b> (some versions of  Synaptic may place themselves in <b class="calibre13">System Settings </b>&gt;<b class="calibre13"> Synaptic</b>). Once Synaptic is  running, you need to find the MPlayer program in the Synaptic package list. Just  type <span>mplayer</span> in the <b class="calibre13">Find</b> box at the right side of the program window, and the  package name will appear highlighted within the package pane in the middle of the program window (see <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU108">Figure 10-4</a>). Click the little arrow next to <b class="calibre13">Applications/Multimedia</b>, and then scroll down until you see <b class="calibre13">mplayer</b>, and click it.</p>

<span><span>Figure 10-4: </span> Using Synaptic to download and install MPlayer</span>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Information about the file will appear at the bottom of the Synaptic window.  As you will see, there are four tabs there, each telling you something about the  file you have chosen. The most important of these are <b class="calibre13">Description</b>, which tells  you something about the file, and <b class="calibre13">Dependencies</b>, which tells you what other files are needed to run or to use the file you have selected. Dependencies that are not  already installed on your system will appear in red, but you needn’t worry about  them because the Synaptic/APT combination will download and install them for  you automatically.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Now you are ready to actually install MPlayer, so here are the simple steps you  need to follow, many of which require no action on your part:</p>
<ol class="orderedlist">

Of course, this could require a lot of downloading  time, so once you’ve clicked that button, and the <b class="calibre13">Execute</b> button after that,  check out the Operation Summary window before committing to the process to  see how much data you will have to download. A full system upgrade may require  downloading over 100MB of files — a very hefty download if you are working  with a dial-up Internet connection. If you think you can bear the size of the  download indicated in your case, click the <b class="calibre13">Proceed</b> button in the Operation  Summary window; if not, click<b class="calibre13"> Cancel</b>. </p>

<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Synaptic can also be used to remove packages you have installed on your system.  This is especially handy for removing RPM packages that do not appear in the  Package Manager window. However, remember that APT and Synaptic deal only  with RPMs. If you downloaded a program file, and then compiled and installed  it yourself from source, as you will learn to do in <a href="DDU0084_split_000.html#488" target="_parent">Chapter 11</a>, it will not appear  in Synaptic. </p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">To remove an RPM package, select <b class="calibre13">All Packages</b> from the <b class="calibre13">Show</b> drop-down  menu at the top of the Synaptic window, and in the middle of the program  window find the package you want to remove. Select it by clicking it, and then click the <b class="calibre13">Remove</b> button. Once you have clicked the <b class="calibre13">Remove</b> button for all the  packages you wish to remove, click the <b class="calibre13">Execute</b> button.</p>

<a name="484" id="484"/><a name="IDX-151" id="IDX-151"/>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">If you fnd that you are frequently using a Freshrpms compatible repository, particulary DAG, to directly download files, you might find it useful to access that  repository via APT/Synaptic. If you are using a dial-up modem, I wouldn’t recommend this because it will slow things down a tad when you update package  lists, but otherwise, it can be rather handy.</p>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">Adding repositories to Synaptic is now quite easy. After running Synaptic, go  to the Preferences menu and select Repositories, which will bring up the Repositories window. To add a new repository, such as DAG, click the New button and  then enter the repository information in the three text boxes at the bottom of  the Repositories window (<a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU111">Figure 10-7</a>). This information can be found on the  homepage of the repository you wish to add. In the case of DAG, this information  is located at <a target="_top" href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/">http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/.</a> </p>

<span><span>Figure 10-7: </span> Adding repositories to the sources list in Synaptic</span>
</div>
<p class="b24-bookeditorial">The repository information is broken into three parts: the URL, the distribution, and the section. On the repository homepage this is usually written in one  line with the different parts separated by spaces. For example, in the case of  Fedora Core 1, the repository details are given as <a target="_top" href="http://apt.sw.be">http://apt.sw.be</a> redhat/fc1/ en/i386 dag, and the placement of these three elements in the Synaptic Repository window can be seen in <a role="targetype:figure" href="#figure.DDU111">Figure 10-7</a>.</p>
