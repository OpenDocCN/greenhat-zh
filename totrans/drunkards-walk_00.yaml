- en: '**A** FEW YEARS AGO a man won the Spanish national lottery with a ticket that
    ended in the number 48\. Proud of his “accomplishment,” he revealed the theory
    that brought him the riches. “I dreamed of the number 7 for seven straight nights,”
    he said, “and 7 times 7 is 48.”[¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts1a)
    Those of us with a better command of our multiplication tables might chuckle at
    the man’s error, but we all create our own view of the world and then employ it
    to filter and process our perceptions, extracting meaning from the ocean of data
    that washes over us in daily life. And we often make errors that, though less
    obvious, are just as significant as his.'

    [¹](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts1a) 我们那些对乘法表有更好掌握的人可能会对这个人的错误嘲笑，但我们都在创造自己的世界观，然后利用它来过滤和加工我们的感知，从日常生活中冲刷过我们的大数据海洋中提取意义。而且我们经常犯错误，虽然不那么明显，但和他的错误一样重要。'
- en: The fact that human intuition is ill suited to situations involving uncertainty
    was known as early as the 1930s, when researchers noted that people could neither
    make up a sequence of numbers that passed mathematical tests for randomness nor
    recognize reliably whether a given string was randomly generated. In the past
    few decades a new academic field has emerged to study how people make judgments
    and decisions when faced with imperfect or incomplete information. Their research
    has shown that when chance is involved, people’s thought processes are often seriously
    flawed. The work draws from many disciplines, from mathematics and the traditional
    sciences as well as cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and modern neuroscience.
    But although such studies were legitimated by a recent Nobel Prize (in Economics),
    their lessons for the most part have not trickled down from academic circles to
    the popular psyche. This book is an attempt to remedy that. It is about the principles
    that govern chance, the development of those ideas, and the manner in which they
    play out in politics, business, medicine, economics, sports, leisure, and other
    areas of human affairs. It is also about the way we make choices and the processes
    that lead us to make mistaken judgments and poor decisions when confronted with
    randomness or uncertainty.

  zh: 早在20世纪30年代，人们就已经知道人类的直觉不适合处理不确定性的情况，当时研究人员注意到，人们既不能编出一个通过随机性数学测试的数字序列，也不能可靠地识别一个给定的字符串是否是随机生成的。在过去的几十年里，一个新的学术领域已经出现，研究人们在面对不完整或不完整信息时如何做出判断和决策。他们的研究表明，当涉及机会时，人们的思想过程往往存在严重缺陷。这项工作借鉴了许多学科，包括数学、传统科学、认知心理学、行为经济学和现代神经科学。尽管这些研究最近得到了诺贝尔经济学奖的认可，但它们的教训在很大程度上并没有从学术界渗透到大众心理。这本书的目的是纠正这一点。它讲述了支配机会的原则，这些想法的发展，以及它们如何在政治、商业、医学、经济学、体育、休闲和其他人类事务领域发挥作用。它还讲述了我们的选择方式，以及我们在面对随机性或不确定性时，如何做出错误判断和糟糕决策的过程。
- en: Information that is lacking often invites competing interpretations. That’s
    why such great effort was required to confirm global warming, why drugs are sometimes
    declared safe and then pulled from the market, and presumably why not everyone
    agrees with my observation that chocolate milkshakes are an indispensable component
    of a heart-healthy diet. Unfortunately the misinterpretation of data has many
    negative consequences, both large and small. As we’ll see, for example, both doctors
    and patients often misinterpret statistics regarding the effectiveness of drugs
    and the meaning of important medical tests. Parents, teachers, and students misunderstand
    the significance of exams such as the SAT, and wine connoisseurs make the same
    mistakes about wine ratings. Investors draw invalid conclusions from the historical
    performance of mutual funds.

  zh: 缺失的信息常常会引发相互竞争的解释。这就是为什么确认全球变暖需要付出如此巨大的努力，为什么药物有时会被宣布为安全然后从市场上撤回，以及为什么并非每个人都同意我的观察，即巧克力奶昔是健康饮食中不可或缺的一部分。不幸的是，数据的误解释有许多负面后果，既有大的也有小的。例如，我们将看到，医生和患者经常误解关于药物有效性和重要医学测试意义的统计数据。父母、教师和学生误解了SAT等考试的真正意义，而葡萄酒鉴赏家在葡萄酒评分上也犯同样的错误。投资者从共同基金的历史表现中得出无效的结论。
- en: 'In sports we have developed a culture in which, based on intuitive feelings
    of correlation, a team’s success or failure is often attributed largely to the
    ability of the coach. As a result, when teams fail, the coach is often fired.
    Mathematical analysis of firings in all major sports, however, has shown that
    those firings had, on average, no effect on team performance.[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts2a)
    An analogous phenomenon occurs in the corporate world, where CEOs are thought
    to have superhuman power to make or break a company. Yet time and time again at
    Kodak, Lucent, Xerox, and other companies, that power has proved illusory. In
    the 1990s, for instance, when he ran GE Capital Services under Jack Welch, Gary
    Wendt was thought of as one of the smartest businessmen in the country. Wendt
    parlayed that reputation into a $45 million bonus when he was hired to run the
    troubled finance company Conseco. Investors apparently agreed that with Wendt
    at the helm, Conseco’s troubles were over: the company’s stock tripled within
    a year. But two years after that Wendt abruptly resigned, Conseco went bankrupt,
    and the stock was trading for pennies.[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts3a)
    Had Wendt’s task been impossible? Was he asleep at the wheel? Or had his coronation
    rested on questionable assumptions—for example, that an executive has a near-absolute
    ability to affect a company or a person’s single past success is a reliable indicator
    of future performance? On any specific occasion one cannot be confident of the
    answers without examining the details of the situation at hand. I will do that
    in several instances in this book, but more important, I will present the tools
    needed to identify the footprints of chance.'

  zh: 在体育领域，我们已经形成了一种文化，即基于直觉的相关感，一个团队的成败往往主要归因于教练的能力。因此，当团队失败时，教练经常被解雇。然而，对所有主要体育项目的解雇进行的数学分析表明，这些解雇平均来说对团队的表现没有影响。[²](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts2a)
    在企业界也存在类似的现象，人们认为首席执行官拥有超凡的力量，可以决定一个公司的兴衰。然而，在柯达、朗讯、施乐和其他公司，这种力量一次又一次地被证明是虚幻的。例如，在20世纪90年代，当杰克·韦尔奇领导通用电气资本服务时，加里·温特被认为是有史以来最聪明的商人之一。温特利用他的声誉在接手陷入困境的金融公司康塞科时获得了4500万美元的奖金。投资者显然认为，有了温特掌舵，康塞科的麻烦就结束了：公司股价在一年内翻了两番。但两年后，温特突然辞职，康塞科破产，股价跌至几分钱。[³](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts3a)
    温特的任务是否不可能完成？他是否在疏忽大意？或者他的加冕礼是否建立在有问题的假设之上——例如，认为高管几乎有绝对能力影响一个公司，或者一个人的单一过去成功是未来表现的可靠指标？在任何特定场合，如果不检查手头情况的细节，就无法对答案有信心。我将在本书的几个实例中这样做，但更重要的是，我将介绍识别偶然足迹所需的工具。
- en: To swim against the current of human intuition is a difficult task. As we’ll
    see, the human mind is built to identify for each event a definite cause and can
    therefore have a hard time accepting the influence of unrelated or random factors.
    And so the first step is to realize that success or failure sometimes arises neither
    from great skill nor from great incompetence but from, as the economist Armen
    Alchian wrote, “fortuitous circumstances.”[⁴](Mlod_9780307377548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#fm1-nts4a)
    Random processes are fundamental in nature and are ubiquitous in our everyday

  zh: 逆流而上，与人类直觉相悖是一项艰巨的任务。正如我们将看到的，人类的大脑被设计成为每个事件寻找一个明确的原因，因此很难接受无关或随机因素的影响。因此，第一步是要认识到成功或失败有时既不是源于高超的技能，也不是源于严重的无能，而是，正如经济学家阿门·阿尔钦所写，“偶然的环境”。自然中的随机过程是基本的，并且在我们日常生活中无处不在，然而，大多数人并不理解它们，也不太考虑它们。
- en: The title *The Drunkard’s Walk* comes from a mathematical term describing random
    motion, such as the paths molecules follow as they fly through space, incessantly
    bumping, and being bumped by, their sister molecules. That can be a metaphor for
    our lives, our paths from college to career, from single life to family life,
    from first hole of golf to eighteenth. The surprise is that the tools used to
    understand the drunkard’s walk can also be employed to help understand the events
    of everyday life. The goal of this book is to illustrate the role of chance in
    the world around us and to show how we may recognize it at work in human affairs.
    I hope that after this tour of the world of randomness, you, the reader, will
    begin to see life in a different light, with a deeper understanding of the everyday
    world.

  zh: 书名《醉酒漫步》源自一个描述随机运动的数学术语，例如分子在空间中飞行时遵循的路径，它们不断地碰撞，并被其姐妹分子碰撞。这可以成为我们生活的隐喻，从大学到职业生涯，从单身生活到家庭生活，从高尔夫的第一洞到第十八洞。令人惊讶的是，用于理解醉酒漫步的工具也可以用来帮助理解日常生活中的事件。本书的目标是阐述偶然在我们周围世界中的作用，并展示我们如何认识到它在人类事务中的运作。我希望在这次对随机世界之旅结束后，你，读者，将开始以不同的眼光看待生活，对日常世界有更深刻的理解。
