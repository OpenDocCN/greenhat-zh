    vector graphics before and are now checking to see what else it can do for you.
    Or, you may be considering Inkscape after having used other vector editing applications
    and would like to know what sets it apart. Whatever your situation is, you may
    find some background information useful. What is SVG? What is Inkscape? Where
    does it come from and where is it headed? What can you use it for? What is Inkscape’s
    place in the world of computer graphics? This introductory chapter attempts to
    answer these and other questions.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The majority of images stored and processed on computers today are represented
    as *rasters*, also called *bitmaps*. A raster image is a rather primitive representation—just
    a lattice of small rectangular areas called *pixels*. For each pixel, the only
    information a raster file stores is its color and, possibly, its transparency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you have a bitmap image with a black circle on white background
    ([Figure 1-1](ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr "Figure 1-1. A
    circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)"), left), there is in fact *no* black
    circle stored in the image at all. It’s only you, when viewing this image, who
    may (or may not) get the *idea* of a black circle. All the computer knows about
    the image is that some of its pixels are black and some are white (and a few are
    an in-between gray).

    image without human guidance. It can paint all the white pixels blue, but it cannot
    move or transform the circle because it does not *see* it as a separate object.
    These kinds of tasks may be difficult even for humans, as anyone who has used
    the GIMP or Photoshop would attest; you’ll have to use complex and unreliable
    tools to “select” the circle, and you can hardly ever do this perfectly if, for
    example, the edge of the circle is *antialiased* (so that some pixels on the edge
    have intermediate values between black and white) as it is in [Figure 1-1](ch01s01.html#circle_as_a_bitmap_left_parenthesisleftr
    "Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)").
  prefs: []

    "Figure 1-1. A circle as a bitmap (left) and vector (right)"), right). In a vector
    format, the actual circle can be stored along with its properties as an *object*.
    This means you can easily separate it from other objects and do whatever you please
    with it. Moreover, with such an image, your computer can do many smart things
    automatically—for example, it can automatically delete all circles, paint all
    red objects with green, or scale all black circles to twice their size.

    is placed on a layer of its own—automatically. Furthermore, in a raster editor,
    you are supposed to eventually “flatten” your image, so that all separate layers
    are merged. By contrast, there’s no need—indeed no possibility—to flatten a vector
    drawing (except by exporting it to a raster image).

    an uncompressed bitmap, doubling the dimensions will quadruple the size of the

    with vector images. A vector image is virtually *boundless*, and expanding it
    by moving an object an inch or a mile away costs nothing in terms of file size
    or computer memory. Similarly, a vector document is virtually infinite in terms
    of *depth*: You can zoom in as close as you want and create any number of microscopic-sized
    objects in any given space. (In reality, of course, both canvas size and zoom
    level are limited, but these limits are much, much larger than in a raster editor.)'

    them by moving them, transforming them, changing their colors, and so on. That’s

    as well. Although Inkscape does not yet support animated SVG, this feature is

    A drawing can change the properties of objects in response to user actions, which
    makes it possible to implement complex user interfaces with buttons, links, drag-and-drop,
    and so on. Again, Inkscape’s current capabilities in this area are limited, but
    you can manually edit an SVG file created in Inkscape, adding interactivity which

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A vector image format (of which there are many, just as there are many different
    raster formats) always limits you to a certain repertoire of objects and their
    properties. New versions of formats invent and introduce new capabilities, but
    that only highlights the fact that perfection is unattainable. Vector formats
    are always “under construction.”
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many images that are very difficult or even impossible to reproduce
    exactly in vector form. For example, images that require complex textures, such
    as human skin, hair, or wood, are not vector-friendly. The world of vectors is
    traditionally made up of precise shapes, flat colors, and smooth gradients; if
    what you like is naturalistic noise, scratches, or dirt, you will probably have
    a hard time rendering that in a typical vector editor.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, with Inkscape’s transparency, gradients, and filters, you can create
    amazingly photorealistic vector images (see Figure 1 on the color insert). Also
    note that, being a higher-level abstraction, a vector drawing may include raster
    images as a special kind of object. Thus, you can always insert a photo into an
    Inkscape drawing and freely combine it with vector objects.

- en: '**Vector format conversions are unreliable.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the same reason, it is never trivial to convert an image from one vector
    format into another. The repertoires of object types and capabilities of the formats
    always differ, sometimes in less than obvious ways; different versions of formats
    muddy the picture even more. For example, SVG supports blurring objects (**[17.1
    Blur](ch17s01.html "17.1 Blur")**) while PDF does not; on the other hand, PDF
    supports gradient meshes (**[1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape](ch01s05.html#onedot5dot4_dot_dot_dot_and_inkscape
    "1.5.4 . . . and Inkscape")**), a feature presently missing in SVG. This makes
    any kind of vector conversion an iffy business. In the best case, you get an approximation
    of the source object that the target format cannot represent directly (for example,
    for exporting SVG to PDF, you may need to replace blurred objects with embedded
    rasters). In the worst case, you’ll simply get a broken image after the conversion.
  prefs:

    is an acknowledged international standard with rich and well-defined capabilities,
    which therefore has the potential to become the lingua franca of vector graphics
    (although Adobe’s PDF is still much more common in this role). We will discuss
    SVG in more detail later in this chapter.

    objects just mentioned, the most common vector object type is a path. A *path*
    is just a sequence of commands like “draw a straight line to such-and-such point”
    and “draw a smooth curve through such-and-such points.” There may be any number
    of such commands in a sequence, which means a path can approximate any geometric
    figure or real-world shape with any desired accuracy. A path can have *fill* (paint
    in the area enclosed by the path) and *stroke* (paint along the path itself),
    as well as many other properties that define how the path looks ([Figure 1-2](ch01s01.html#path_object_can_represent_any_shape
    "Figure 1-2. A path object can represent any shape.")).

    and many other object properties (such as font size, visibility, and blur). Many
    properties can apply to all kinds of objects, while others are specific to particular
    object types. A drawing is just a collection of objects of various types; these
    objects can be placed whenever you need them, including on top of each other,
    and they can even be made partially or fully transparent so that whatever is beneath
    them shows through. Figure 1 on the color insert shows an example of a complex
    Inkscape drawing that makes heavy use of opacity, gradients, and blur to achieve
    realism (you can load it from Inkscape’s *examples* directory if you want to examine
    it in full glory).

    commonly used Web standards, including HTML and XML. That group included representatives
    of (among others) Adobe, Microsoft, and Macromedia. The first fruit of their labors,
    SVG 1.0, appeared in 2001; the most recent official version is 1.1, published

    hard to do things the right way from the beginning. It inherited a lot of good
    stuff from PostScript and PDF (**[1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats](ch01s05.html#onedot5dot1dot1_adobeapostrophes_vector
    "1.5.1.1 Adobe’s Vector Formats")**) but was designed to be free from their limitations.
    SVG natively supports transparency, gradients, Unicode for text, and many other
    conveniences that are taken for granted in the 21st century. It also adds unique
    filter effects ([Chapter 17](ch17.html "Chapter 17. Filters")), which are basically
    raster operations (such as blur) that can be applied to an object without losing
    its vector editability and resolution independence.

    features are also missing; for example, references to resources (such as gradients

    publishing revolution” of the 1980s, driven by accessible personal computers and
    laser printers.'

    language* and not just a data format. A PostScript file is actually a program
    that a printer or computer must run in order to get an image. For example, a PostScript
    file may contain an instruction to print a text line, such as “I must not disrupt
    the class,” and a loop that will repeat this line a hundred times. Unfortunately,
    this also means that, due to an error in the program or someone’s malicious intent,
    a PostScript program might run indefinitely, tying up the system’s resources.

    a generalized vector graphics language. For example, Level 2 of PostScript (1991)
    added device-independent CMYK color, but it wasn’t until Level 3 (1997) that such
    a basic thing as gradients became directly possible. (Until PS 3, applications
    wishing to create a gradient in PostScript had to “fake” it by overlaying many
    narrow strips of gradually changing color.) And even today, PostScript still does
    not support transparency natively.

    so slow to gain the new features that users demanded (and that competing vector

    being built with the PostScript feature set in mind, with everything else treated
    as an afterthought.

    Over time, its being a programming language proved to be much more of a burden:
    What was once a clever hack in the late 1980s is now regarded as very cumbersome
    and dangerous. Since any PostScript file is a program, you simply cannot tell
    what exactly this file will display except by *running* that program. This means
    you need a complete PostScript interpreter in order to do even the simplest processing
    of PostScript files, and you cannot directly combine two PostScript files into
    a single document with predictable results.'

    fashion with added compression and some top-level document management features.
    Later, Adobe went on to develop PDF well past what was ever available in PostScript;
    for example, transparency was added in PDF version 1.4 (2001).'

    switched its native AI file format to one based on PDF instead of on PostScript.
    This means that any AI file saved in a modern version of Adobe Illustrator is
    in fact PDF and can be viewed and imported by any software that supports PDF.
    For example, Inkscape’s AI importer is actually the same as its PDF importer.

    converting them into PDF first, which requires the free cross-platform Ghostscript
    package (**[B.4 PostScript and EPS (Import, Export)](apbs04.html "B.4 PostScript

    convenient transparency support, and a context-sensitive panel with controls relevant
    to the current tool (despite the obviousness of the idea, it’s something Illustrator

    respects. Of the missing features, perhaps the most important is the lack of native
    CMYK support, which makes it hardly usable for creating files for print (**[8.2.2
    CMYK](ch08s02.html#eightdot2dot2_cmyk "8.2.2 CMYK")**). Also, Inkscape has no
    gradient meshes. This is a feature of AI and some other applications that allows
    different colors to be assigned to different points of a single object, with smooth
    transitions between the colors. Gradient meshes allow AI artists to create extremely
    photorealistic art with a minimum of objects. On the other hand, Inkscape already
    has some innovative features that are pretty much unique in its field, such as
    the clone tiler (**[16.6 Tiling Clones](ch16s06.html "16.6 Tiling Clones")**),

    Gradient Tool](ch10s01.html "10.1 The Gradient Tool")**) but lacks other gradient

    you have an idea and can code, don’t try to talk others into implementing it;
