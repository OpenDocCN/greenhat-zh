Despite the differences among them all, however, one thing that I eventually suffered from in each case was a kind of visual boredom. I suppose you might call it GUI fatigue. It wasn't that I was tired of using a graphical interface; it was just that I couldn't help but get sick of looking at the same old icons, window borders, and color schemes. Of course, there were some changes that could be made, but it just wasn't possible to get around the basic look and feel without add-ons that demanded a price in terms of performance.</p><p>One of the features of Linux that pleased me to no end, and continues to do so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don't mean just the icons and backgrounds but <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>, including the actual window borders and controls. Add to that the variety of graphical desktop environments and window managers available for Linux, and you have a totally customizable system. Is it any wonder that there are so many more Linux desktop screenshots on the Web than for any other system? If you don't believe me, just take a look at a site dedicated to Linux screenshots, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lynucs.org/">http://www.lynucs.org/</a>, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Screenshots</strong></span> link.</p><p>You may not be as fickle as I am in terms of the look and feel of your system, but you can learn to use and enjoy all the graphical customization power that Linux offers you as you work through this chapter.</p><div class="sect1" title="Project 8A: Creating a New User Account"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="project_8a_colon_creating_a_new_user_acc"/>Project 8A: Creating a New User Account</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are reluctant to alter the look of your current setup, you can create a new user account and experiment with making the changes in this chapter when logged in to the new account. If you opt to go this route, your regular home environment will remain untouched, because look-and-feel customizations that are performed in one user account do not affect other user accounts.

Fortunately, there's an alternative: You can temporarily <span class="emphasis"><em>switch users</em></span>. Switching users differs from the logout/login approach, in that you remain logged in to your original account while you log in to your other account (or while someone else with an account on your computer logs in to theirs). Going this route keeps all the windows and applications you have open. These windows will not appear in the account you are switching to, but they will be there, conveniently waiting for you, when you switch back to the account from whence you came.</p><p>This is a good way to proceed if you plan to be switching back and forth between your two accounts. It is also a good approach when, say, your child needs to log in to their account for a moment to do a quick email check, burn a CD to play on the way to the beach, or print a file for school. When your child is done, you can quickly get back to what you were doing without having to reopen files, web pages, or whatever else you happened to be dealing with at the time of the switch.</p><p>You can switch users quite easily by clicking the power button on the top GNOME panel and selecting the user account you want to switch to. After a few seconds you'll be asked for the password for the account you selected, so type it into the box, and press the <span class="keycap"><strong>enter</strong></span> key. After that, you will be at the desktop of the selected user account.</p><p>To get back to your original user account after going the switch-user route, just click the power button, click the username from which you came, and after a few seconds of darkness, a window will appear into which you must type the user password of the account you are returning to. Type your password, click <span class="strong"><strong>Unlock</strong></span>, and you will be back at your original desktop, with everything as it was when you last saw it, open windows and all. Pretty cool.</p></div></div></div>

By the time we get to the end of the process, you will have created a much wilder and gaudier desktop environment than you've ever seen before. All of this is in good fun, of course, and when you are done, you should be able to completely and confidently customize things the way you want on your own. So, let's go.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0673" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0674" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0675" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0676" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect2" title="8B-1: Adding Emblems to Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-1_colon_adding_emblems_to_folders"/>8B-1: Adding Emblems to Folders</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the coolest things about Nautilus is that it allows you to add little folder-top icons called <span class="emphasis"><em>emblems</em></span>. These emblems can graphically remind you what each folder is for, and they're not only for folders—you can add them to files too. The look of these emblems also changes when you change your desktop themes, so you're in for more visual excitement later in this chapter. For now, however, let's learn how to use them by adding one to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Documents</em></span> folder. Open your home folder, right-click <span class="strong"><strong>Documents</strong></span>, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> in the pop-up menu. When the Properties window appears, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Emblems</strong></span> tab, and scroll down until you see the emblem called <span class="emphasis"><em>Personal</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#choosing_emblems_for_your_folders" title="Figure 8-3. Choosing emblems for your folders">Figure 8-3</a>). Click the checkbox next to it, and then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span> button. The emblem should now appear on your folder.</p><div class="figure"><a id="choosing_emblems_for_your_folders"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9278"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656304.png.jpg" alt="Choosing emblems for your folders"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-3. Choosing emblems for your folders</p></div><p>Now, for additional practice, try adding the Sound emblem to your <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder. Just use the same steps as before, and substitute the appropriate items and entries. When you're finished, you should have a <span class="emphasis"><em>Music</em></span> folder that is surrounded by musical notes—one is the emblem, the other is the folder's default icon. Not all folders have default icons, so that's when emblems really come in handy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8B-2: Setting Window Backgrounds (and Emblems Again)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-2_colon_setting_window_backgrounds_ope"/>8B-2: Setting Window Backgrounds (and Emblems Again)</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you've added those two emblems, your folders should look a bit spunkier (and you'll make those emblems look spunkier still later in the chapter). Nevertheless, the background of the Nautilus window is still plain and white. You need not stand for that if you don't want to; you can change it as well. To do so, just go to your home window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Backgrounds and Emblems</strong></span>. The Backgrounds and Emblems window will then appear (see <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#choosing_a_background_for_your_nautilus" title="Figure 8-4. Choosing a background for your Nautilus window">Figure 8-4</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0677" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0678" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0679" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0680" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0681" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0682" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="choosing_a_background_for_your_nautilus"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9338"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656306.png.jpg" alt="Choosing a background for your Nautilus window"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-4. Choosing a background for your Nautilus window</p></div><p>From this window, you can drag any pattern into your home window, or into any other Nautilus window for that matter, and the pattern will then become the background for all your Nautilus windows. So, for experience's sake, scroll down to find the pattern called <span class="emphasis"><em>Manila Paper</em></span>, and then drag it to the whitespace in the main pane of your home window. Once you've done that, the previously white window area will look like the wallpaper in a lawyer's office. Very nice, if you like that sort of thing. You can change it to a different background in the same way, of course, or you can go back to the default white by dragging the <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span> swatch into the window.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you prefer to use an image of your own for the Nautilus window background, you can do so quite easily. Just locate the image in a new Nautilus window, click it with both the left and right mouse buttons (or just the middle mouse button, if you have a three-button mouse), and then drag the image to any open space within the target window. When you release the buttons, select <span class="bolditalic">Set as Background</span> in the pop-up menu that then appears.</p></div><p>In addition to the buttons for pattern and color swatches, there is a third button in the Backgrounds and Emblems window called <span class="emphasis"><em>Emblems</em></span>. Clicking the Emblems button reveals all the emblems you saw in Project 8B-1, thus providing you with another way to add them to your folders. This method is far handier when adding emblems to several folders or files in the same go.</p><p>To see how this works, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Emblems</strong></span> button. Then drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> emblem onto your <span class="emphasis"><em>Pictures</em></span> folder and the <span class="strong"><strong>People</strong></span> emblem onto your <span class="emphasis"><em>Public</em></span> folder. The selected emblems will immediately appear on those folders, adding to the growing proliferation of icons in the window.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8B-3: Dolling Up the Side Pane (and Emblems Yet Again)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-3_colon_dolling_up_the_side_pane_open"/>8B-3: Dolling Up the Side Pane (and Emblems Yet Again)</h2></div></div></div><p>Now let's change the look of the Nautilus side pane. Keeping the Backgrounds and Emblems window open (if you already closed it, open it again), click the <span class="strong"><strong>Places</strong></span> menu button in the Nautilus side pane, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Information</strong></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0683" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0684" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0685" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0686" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can add a different background pattern to the side pane now as well, but for practice let's add a color instead. To do this, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Colors</strong></span> button in the Backgrounds and Emblems window. The window will now be filled with swatches of color. Drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Grapefruit</strong></span> swatch to your side pane, and it will turn from gray to, of all things, grapefruit (albeit a very dark and unusually colored grapefruit). You can also create a two-color gradation effect by adding yet another color. Drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Mango</strong></span> swatch to the very bottom of the side pane (but still within the pane), and you should have a grapefruit-to-mango, top-to-bottom gradation within the pane. Of course, if you are not pleased with this tropical color set, you can get back to your original default gray panel by dragging the <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span> swatch onto the area. When you're done, you can close the Backgrounds and Emblems window.</p><p>The side pane of your Nautilus window provides yet a third way to work with emblems. But before I let you in on this third (and last) way, let's add another folder to your home folder. Create a folder and name it <span class="emphasis"><em>Finances</em></span>, which you can use to store files dealing with your relative worth in the modern scheme of things.</p><p>After you've created the new folder, go to the side pane, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Information</strong></span> drop-down menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Emblems</strong></span>. A list of emblems will appear within the side pane. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Money</strong></span> emblem, and drag it onto your <span class="emphasis"><em>Finances</em></span> folder. Next, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Plan</strong></span> emblem, and drag it onto the <span class="emphasis"><em>Finances</em></span> folder too. Add even more emblems to it if you like—you should be able to fit about four on there before Nautilus decides to end the madness and prevent any more from being displayed. Your window should now look something like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#selecting_emblems_from_the_nautilus_side" title="Figure 8-5. Selecting emblems from the Nautilus side pane">Figure 8-5</a>.</p><p>Once you are done, go back to the drop-down menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Places</strong></span> to get everything back to relative normalcy again.</p><p>Even if it's not your cup of tea, you have to admit that your Nautilus window is definitely more colorful now. You can, of course, change it to look however you want, but I'll ask you to hold off on that a little while longer, because you are going to be doing some more playing around with it shortly.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8B-4: Changing the Desktop Background"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-4_colon_changing_the_desktop_backgroun"/>8B-4: Changing the Desktop Background</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that your home folder window is all gussied up (or gaudied up, depending on your aesthetic sense of things), you may think your desktop looks rather drab in comparison.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0687" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You can easily change the desktop background (often called <span class="emphasis"><em>wallpaper</em></span>) by right-clicking any open space on the desktop and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Change Desktop Background</strong></span> in the pop-up menu.

In this case, however, you are going to venture out onto the Web to get and then install some wallpaper.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0688" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0689" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0690" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0691" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A number of sites provide free desktop wallpaper—two sites specifically geared toward Linux users are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome-look.org/">http://www.gnome-look.org/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</a>, but you can get wallpaper from wherever you like.

Fortunately for you, me, and all involved in such things, there is an even easier way: the Art Manager.

However, after having gone through <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. ROUNDING OUT THE BIRD">Chapter 6</a>, you know how easy it is to download and install applications like the Art Manager. All you have to do is run the Ubuntu Software Center, search for <span class="emphasis"><em>gnome-art</em></span>, and then install the Art Manager.</p><p>You can then run the Art Manager by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Art Manager</strong></span>. The GNOME Art window will then appear with absolutely nothing in it. To put it to use and relieve that emptiness, select <span class="strong"><strong>Art</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Backgrounds</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>GNOME</strong></span>. (You can select <span class="strong"><strong>All</strong></span> instead of GNOME if you like, but it will take longer to download the list of available wallpapers.)</p><p>Once you've made your selection, the Art Manager will begin downloading a list of all that is available for you at <a class="ulink" href="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</a>. It may seem like nothing is happening for a minute or so, but that is normal; just hang in there. It might take a few minutes to download previews of the backgrounds, but when it's done, you will see a list of thumbnails for you to choose from (<a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#installing_desktop_wallpapers_using_the" title="Figure 8-9. Installing desktop wallpapers using the Art Manager">Figure 8-9</a>).</p><p>You can now install wallpaper by scrolling down until you find one that suits your fancy, clicking it once to highlight it, and then clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> button. The Art Manager will then download and install it. After that, open the Appearance Preferences window, and choose the wallpaper you just downloaded as your desktop wallpaper. As I said before, the Art Manager is a very handy tool to have, especially since you'll be using it more soon within this project.</p><div class="figure"><a id="installing_desktop_wallpapers_using_the"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9695"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656316.png.jpg" alt="Installing desktop wallpapers using the Art Manager"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-9. Installing desktop wallpapers using the Art Manager</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="8B-7: Changing Window Borders, Controls, and Icon Sets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="b-7_colon_changing_window_borders_comma"/>8B-7: Changing Window Borders, Controls, and Icon Sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Now we get to my favorite part of this journey through the world of digital cosmetic surgery—changing the way window borders and controls look in GNOME. The procedure is really quite easy. Select <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Appearance</strong></span>. The Appearance Preferences window will open to the Theme tab, showing you a list of the themes that are installed on your system (see <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#selecting_a_theme_in_gnome" title="Figure 8-10. Selecting a theme in GNOME">Figure 8-10</a>). The default theme in Lucid Lynx is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Ambiance</em></span>, but, as you can see, there are several others.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0698" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0699" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0700" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0701" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0702" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0703" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-8-0704" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To get the hang of things, take a look at each of the themes listed by clicking them one by one. The changes will take effect immediately. Just clicking a theme will change your window borders, controls, and even, if you take a peek in your home folder, the icons. This is especially noticeable when you click Dust Sand or New Wave.</p><p>Each theme consists of a window border, a set of controls, and a collection of icons. It's also possible to mix and match these elements on your own. For example, let's say that you like the subdued look and color of the controls in Dust, but you prefer the window icons in Clearlooks and the borders in DarkRoom. Well, you needn't despair, because you can create a custom theme consisting of these three different elements.</p><p>To create your own mix-and-match theme, just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Customize</strong></span> button on the Theme tab of the Appearance Preferences window. A new window will open, in which you will find five tabs: Controls, Colors, Window Border, Icons, and Pointer (<a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#creating_a_custom_theme_in_ubuntu" title="Figure 8-11. Creating a custom theme in Ubuntu">Figure 8-11</a>). From within each of these tabs, you can select the components you prefer. For now, let's first click the <span class="strong"><strong>Controls</strong></span> tab and select <span class="strong"><strong>Dust</strong></span>. Then click the <span class="strong"><strong>Window Border</strong></span> tab, and select <span class="strong"><strong>DarkRoom</strong></span>. Finally, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Icons</strong></span> tab, and select <span class="strong"><strong>GNOME</strong></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="selecting_a_theme_in_gnome"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9786"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656318.png.jpg" alt="Selecting a theme in GNOME"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-10. Selecting a theme in GNOME</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="creating_a_custom_theme_in_ubuntu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject8_d1e9794"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages656320.png.jpg" alt="Creating a custom theme in Ubuntu"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 8-11. Creating a custom theme in Ubuntu</p></div><p>Now keep the Customize Theme window open, but open your home folder and take a look at what you've done. Hmm . . . not bad. But, perhaps you don't really like the look of those DarkRoom window borders all that much. To find something that suits you better, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Window Border</strong></span> tab again, go down the list, and click each entry until you see something you do like (New Wave seems to do the trick for me) and select that. Better? Now that you are satisfied, you can click the <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span> button.</p><p>You will now be back at the Appearance Preferences window, where you will notice your new theme listed with the name <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom</em></span>. If you want to save this new combination for later use, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span> button. Doing so will open a dialog box in which you can name your theme and write a brief comment about it. So, name your theme, write a comment if you like, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. Your new theme will now appear in alphabetical order within the theme list under the name you chose.</p><p>Once that's all done, your home folder window should look like that in <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#changing_the_look_of_your_system_windows" title="Figure 8-12. Changing the look of your system windows">Figure 8-12</a> (and take a look at your panel and Applications menu while you're at it).

If you have only one user account on your machine, the easiest way is to install the fonts locally, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#c-2_colon_installing_fonts_locally" title="8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally">8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#c-2_colon_installing_fonts_locally" title="8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally">8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally</a>. Locally installed fonts are ones that only you or someone logged in to your user account will be able to use. On the other hand, if you have more than one user account and want the fonts to be available to all the users on your machine, you'll need to install them globally—in this case, see <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#c-3_colon_installing_truetype_fonts_glob" title="8C-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally">8C-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#c-3_colon_installing_truetype_fonts_glob" title="8C-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally">8C-3: Installing TrueType Fonts Globally</a>.</p><div class="sect2" title="8C-1: Getting the Font Files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="c-1_colon_getting_the_font_files"/>8C-1: Getting the Font Files</h2></div></div></div><p>The Internet is awash in free fonts. For this project, I will point you to the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fontfreak.com/">http://www.fontfreak.com/</a> site, which has a very nice collection of fonts. Once you get to the FontFreak home page, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Fonts</strong></span> link under the "FREE FONTS" heading on the left side of the page. The next page will ask you whether you want to download all the free fonts on the site in one single file; click <span class="strong"><strong>No thanks, I will download them one by one</strong></span>. This will lead you to the main list of free fonts; browse through the various pages until you find one that is to your liking, and then click it. Which font you download is completely up to you, but be sure to choose the PC version, not the Mac version. You can do this by clicking the Windows icon at the bottom of the font page (next to where it says <span class="emphasis"><em>Download</em></span>). When the download window pops up, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Save File</strong></span> and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save the font as a <span class="emphasis"><em>.zip</em></span> file. To follow along with this project, download a couple of fonts—I chose Aajax Surreal Freak and Accidental Presidency.<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0733" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When you've finished downloading, drag the font files from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span> folder (or wherever you saved them) to your home folder so it's easy to follow along with my instructions. Also, be sure to unzip your font files before going on to the installation steps. (Right-click each <span class="emphasis"><em>.zip</em></span> file, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Extract Here</strong></span>.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="c-2_colon_installing_fonts_locally"/>8C-2: Installing Fonts Locally</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're the sole user of your computer, installing fonts locally will do just fine.

If you like, you can kick the effects up a notch by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Appearance</strong></span>, clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Visual Effects</strong></span> tab of the Preferences window, and finally selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Extra</strong></span> in that tab.</p><p>I should warn you not to be freaked out at first when you try to move your windows and they start wiggling like jelly—that's one of the additional effects (Wobbly Windows).</p><p>Whatever the hardware capabilities of your system, if you really want to take control of all that Compiz has to offer, it is worth your while to install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (<a class="xref" href="ch08s08.html#taking_control_of_compiz_apostrophy_s_sp" title="Figure 8-28. Taking control of Compiz's special effects">Figure 8-28</a>), which you can get via the Ubuntu Software Center (search for <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Desktop Effects Settings</em></span> and install it). Once it's installed, you can run it by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> ▸ <span class="strong"><strong>CompizConfig Settings Manager</strong></span>.</p><p>Once the CompizConfig Settings Manager is installed, you can see everything Compiz is capable of doing, and you can pick and choose from those features as you see fit. Although most of what Compiz has to offer is essentially eye-candy (which is what this chapter is all about, after all), there are some functional utilities and extras. A favorite of mine is the Annotate tool, which allows you to write all over your screen while making presentations, brainstorming, or just flipping out (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08s08.html#compiz_apostrophy_s_annotate_tool_in_act" title="Figure 8-29. Compiz's Annotate tool in action">Figure 8-29</a>).<a id="IDX-CHP-8-0761" class="indexterm"/></p><p>To activate the Annotate tool—or any other Compiz feature—open the CompizConfig Settings Manager, and check the box next to its name. To figure out how to actually use what you've enabled, click the name of the feature.
