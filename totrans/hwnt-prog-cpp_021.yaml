- en: The program is a simple one designed to check the numbers between 2 and 9 to
    see if they are prime. The algorithm that is used is a bit simplistic and does
    its work using the brute force method, but it looks like it should work. So what
    really happens?

- en: The Social Welfare computer in Washington state used to store a person's age
    as two digits. One lady got too old for the system. When she reached 100 the computer
    recorded her age as 00\. 101 was stored as 01\. This didn't become a problem till
    she reached the age of 107 and the government sent a truant officer out to her
    house to see why she wasn't in the first grade.
