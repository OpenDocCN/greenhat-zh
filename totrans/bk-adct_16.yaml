- en: The world of audio recording and processing hardware is large and bewildering,
    and it uncomfortably straddles both the analog and digital worlds. It’s not always
    clear if a particular device will work with a computer, or what devices are necessary
    for digital audio recording.

    converters, microphones, and portable digital recorders in various price ranges
    to give you an idea of what is available. This is far from a comprehensive catalog,
    but hopefully it will give you a good start in understanding audio gear.

    Audacity, an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter, and some kind of interface
    to connect microphones or musical instruments to your ADC/DAC. This could be as
    simple as a laptop and a microphone. You can start out cheap and simple and build
    up over time as you want.'

    My favorite online shopping site is zZounds ([http://www.zzounds.com/](http://www.zzounds.com/)).
    They carry a huge inventory, have great prices, and provide the best customer
    service. B&H Photo Video are also first-rate ([http://www.bhphotovideo.com/](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/)).
    Both sites are great for learning about products and pricing, and they generate
    a lot of useful customer reviews.

    is faster than PCI, because each PCI-e slot has its down dedicated bus while PCI
    devices share bandwidth. Both are excellent and least-hassle.

    breakout boxes for connecting mics, mixers, preamps, and other devices. Some of
    them, in place of breakout boxes, use breakout cable bundles.
