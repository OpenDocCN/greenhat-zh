    system around. Despite the differences among them all, however, one thing that
    I eventually suffered from in each case was a kind of visual boredom. I suppose
    you might call it GUI fatigue. It wasn't that I was tired of using a graphical
    interface; it was just that I couldn't help but get sick of looking at the same
    old icons, window borders, and color schemes. Of course, there were some changes
    that could be made, but it just wasn't possible to get around the basic look and
    feel without add-ons that demanded a price in terms of performance.

    so, is that users can drastically change the look of things. I don't mean just
    the icons and backgrounds but *everything*, including the actual window borders
    and controls. Add to that the variety of graphical desktop environments and window
    managers available for Linux, and you have a totally customizable system. Is it
    any wonder that there are so many more Linux desktop screenshots on the Web than
    for any other system? If you don't believe me, just take a look at a site dedicated
    to Linux screenshots, [http://www.lynucs.org/](http://www.lynucs.org/), and click
    the **Screenshots** link.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the coolest things about Nautilus is that it allows you to add little
    folder-top icons called *emblems*. These emblems can graphically remind you what
    each folder is for, and they're not only for folders—you can add them to files
    too. The look of these emblems also changes when you change your desktop themes,
    so you're in for more visual excitement later in this chapter. For now, however,
    let's learn how to use them by adding one to the *Documents* folder. Open your
    home folder, right-click **Documents**, and then select **Properties** in the
    pop-up menu. When the Properties window appears, click the **Emblems** tab, and
    scroll down until you see the emblem called *Personal* ([Figure 8-3](ch08s02.html#choosing_emblems_for_your_folders
    "Figure 8-3. Choosing emblems for your folders")). Click the checkbox next to
    it, and then click the **Close** button. The emblem should now appear on your
    folder.

    When you're finished, you should have a *Music* folder that is surrounded by musical
    notes—one is the emblem, the other is the folder's default icon. Not all folders
    have default icons, so that's when emblems really come in handy.

    the background of the Nautilus window is still plain and white. You need not stand
    for that if you don't want to; you can change it as well. To do so, just go to
    your home window, click the **Edit** menu, and select **Backgrounds and Emblems**.
    The Backgrounds and Emblems window will then appear (see [Figure 8-4](ch08s02.html#choosing_a_background_for_your_nautilus

    pane of your home window. Once you've done that, the previously white window area
    will look like the wallpaper in a lawyer's office. Very nice, if you like that
    sort of thing. You can change it to a different background in the same way, of
    course, or you can go back to the default white by dragging the **Reset** swatch

    or New Wave.

    example, let's say that you like the subdued look and color of the controls in
    Dust, but you prefer the window icons in Clearlooks and the borders in DarkRoom.

    as root without switching to a different user account by using a system called
    `sudo` (more on this in [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. SIMPLE KITTEN WAYS")),

    in `sudo` mode unless you absolutely must.
